"The Mercenary"☃"Master Tonberry"☃"Dance_Bemani@hotmail.com"☃"I have to say, I really enjoyed playing this game. The relic system really enhanced the game to its fullest potential. And the lvl system was the best I've seen in a long time. Was it just me, or did this game seem to have a remnant of Anthony Testa's games? When I first started playing this, I realized how much his games and this game had in common. I'm probably gonna get flamed for this, but, I thought this game seemed a little better than, say Dungeon Master Gallery. I really, really, really, liked the weapon system. Probably the one thing I didn't like was the name; it didn't seem to fit the game. "☃"1030650705"☃"merc.zip"☃"4"☃
"The Mercenary"☃"Fishfood"☃"misanthropyrules@hotmail.com"☃"It's diablo 2, for ZZT. It's been done before, yes, but this time it's actually playable. Let's start with the good. The levels are well designed, have a good balance of gameplay, and the programming for the level system is pretty good. The relic system gave the game a good touch on non-linearity. Nowhere near enough to want to play the game twice of course, but it still added another level to an otherwise shawllow concept. <br /><br />However, the graphics are pretty simple fading shades, and don't seem to really fit the game very well. It plays much more like an oldschool game in the respect it doesn't actually seem to have any reasoning or plot behind it, just the random touching of objects to advance to the next level, then touching more objects and so on so on. <br /><br />It's all very well if you're playing diablo when you can at least have fun equipping your character with random stuff and looking at pretty graphics, but in this game, you don't have either, which just makes it seem very simple, and shallow. Maybe one day someone will make a game just like this, only intersperse it with towns, and a plot? Something to give people a reason to play on other than stats. <br /><br />Other than the lack of any proper reason to be killing these things in the first place and the confusing name, Mercenary is a pretty good game. Nice programming and good idea, but the execution does leave a LOT to be desired. Still, something to build on. "☃"1030650793"☃"merc.zip"☃"3"☃
"Nightmare"☃"John W Wells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"Nightmare, by the author of the excellent ZZT Syndromes, is a solid puzzle game with cleverly designed obstacles and passable writing. Aside from being a good few hours of fun, it offers proof that older ZZT games did not necessarily involve yellow borders, pre-generated monsters, and laughable dialogue. <br /><br />A few minor puzzles, such as the multiple choice riddles, seemed tacked-on, but most are competent and challenging, and easily surpass the gameplay of the majority of recent releases. Oh... and don't cheat. Barjesse doesn't like that, and it won't help much, anyway. <br /><br />Pros: Excellent puzzles, good overall design, good visuals for its time <br />Cons: Somewhat trite plot.

"The Rose"☃"John W Wells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"&quot;The Rose&quot; is a unique game. Whatever its flaws, it's a unique game. <br /><br />Based on a dream, which was apparently influenced by the author's daily life, television viewing habits, and general oddness, &quot;The Rose&quot; manages to maintain a coherent, but utterly surreal, plot, a story of superheroes and heated chains covered in Drano, of schoolyard friendships and bank robberies. <br /><br />The gameplay - what there is of it - generally consists of walking through passages to view cutscenes. A bit of actual play occasionally pops up to spice things up, but this is only an interactive movie in the loosest definition of the word &quot;interactive.&quot; There are almost no choices, and there is only one ending. <br /><br />That ending is sentimental, clumsily written (&quot;every rose has is thorn&quot;), and oddly haunting - much like the rest of the game. The music is probably the key factor here - it's probably the most effective thing in the game. <br /><br />Is &quot;The Rose&quot; worth playing? Yes. Is it the best game out there? Not by far. <br /><br />Is it good? <br /><br />I guess it depends on your tastes. "☃"1030653172"☃"therose.zip"☃"4"☃
"Dry Gulch SE"☃"John W Wells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"As I began to play &quot;Dry Gulch SE,&quot; I saw the opening text and thought, &quot;this is promising.&quot; The graphics and writing evoked a fine Spaghetti Western atmosphere, and the opening - a lone stranger wanders into a dying town in the Old West - was right on target. It's all been done many times, of course, but the reason for this is that the setup is simple, streamlined, and effective. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the game collapsed soon after its promising beginning. The interiors were clearly not reworked the way the exteriors were, resulting in a stark contrast between dry, dusty desert scenes and sterile buildings, and the plotline, such as it was, didn't go anywhere. The only apparent goal was to wander the desert and try to leave, and there was no real hint about how to do even THAT. As it turns out, the sole barrier to exit disappears magically once you accomplish certain tasks. <br /><br />There are a few strong moments, but the game design commits three terrible errors, in addition to its aimlessness: <br /><br />1: At one point, the player is given infinite torches, ammo, and gems. Later, said player is expected to _care_ when he finds a treasure trove of gems. <br /><br />2: One character tells the player to keep to the honest path unless sure of himself and the morality of his actions. Later, it is necessary to contradict this advice and do something amoral (at best) to advance, unless I missed something. <br /><br />3: The ending makes no sense. Again, unless I missed something, it came out of nowhere. <br /><br />Dry Gulch SE isn't a terrible game, and it is pretty short, so it's probably worth your time. The exteriors are good, and the whole package isn't bad for a remake. Just don't let the introduction get your hopes up. "☃"1030653297"☃"drygulchse.zip"☃"3"☃
"Edible Vomit"☃"MadTom"☃"madtom@comic.com"☃"Edible Vomit endures as my favourite ZZT game of all time. It has a depth which one generally does not come to expect from drac0, taking Teen Priest and other such games as an example. <br /><br />You are Freddy the Ferret, a rodent heroin junkie on the quest for the perfect drug, wandering through a trippy (and superbly drawn) ZZT world. Along the way you will administer marijuana to a rabbit, steal a toke from a nine-year-old, yell at a 'wounded wanker,' and bash hell out of a statue of a child, using a hammer. <br /><br />Typical drac0ism? Not so. As you near the end of the game it becomes very clear that there is some very deep meaning here. Whilst not exactly subtle it is nevertheless very effective; the use of drugs is finally called into question. <br /><br />With basic but appropriate and effective music, superb (and in my opinion anachronistic) graphics, and a very emotive storyline interwoven with the drac0isms we all know and hate/love, Edible Vomit is without a doubt one of the greatest ZZT games ever made. <br /><br />And, hell, you've got to love a game starring a rat named Stinky who does too many white lines and likes doing weird stuff to dead guys."☃"1030653444"☃"v0mit.zip"☃"5"☃

Soup must've had no concept of the #lock command because you can touch your attack object five times before you are attacked once by your opponent.

"Operation: GAMMA VELORUM"☃"John W Wells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"Operation: Gamma Velorum, Part 1, is essentially an interactive movie with a few gameplay sequences thrown in for good measure. Two RPG battles, a Wak-a-Mole style arcade sequence, a very good rendition of Pong, and a well-done endgame action sequence serve to prevent boredom from setting in. These sequences are all well-executed, but the experience of playing OGVP1 is mainly one of watching cutscenes, following characters around, and bumping into people. This isn't necessarily a problem; an interactive movie game can be a good ZZT game, provided that it works as an interactive movie. <br /><br />In a ZZT game, having any coherent storyline at all is a considerable merit. In an interactive movie, the plotline is obviously crucial. Even when, as in the case of OGV1, the storyline is overused, predictable, and unlikely, it still lends some enjoyment to a game by providing a general goal for the player and a driving force for the action. The plotiline of OGV1 serves its purpose of keeping the show going, and is moderately entertaining in a &quot;watch the Death Star explode&quot; way. <br /><br />What does OGV1 do wrong? Well, not much, as ZZT games go. There are annoying spelling errors, and the storyline requires a very heavy dose of suspension of disbelief due to its internal inconsistency, but this sort of thing is expected. The real problem is not what OGV1 does wrong, but what it could have done right. It could have done something unpredictable with the story. It could have added some interesting twist to the mechanics of the RPG battles. It could have given us truly interesting characters, or some clever humor, or a bit of real drama, horror, or excitement. <br /><br />In short, OGV1 could have been a really good game, as opposed to being &quot;very good as ZZT games go.&quot; It has its moments, certainly, but it could have been better. <br /><br />This review might seem extremely negative, but I'm only concentrating on the negative aspects of OGV1 because it could have been much better. OGV1 does get a lot of things right, like its well- animated cutscenes, its attempts to make the environment seem extensive (it really looks, at times, as if the stark environments are being used as more than set pieces), and its avoidance of pointless &quot;filler&quot; material. It's better than 90% of the ZZT games out there, if not more. It's cleanly executed, and it's very workmanlike. <br /><br />Again, though, it could have been much better with a little more polish and a bit of originality. "☃"1030654703"☃"oprgv1.zip"☃"4"☃
"Operation: GAMMA VELORUM"☃"Fishfood"☃"misanthropyrules@hotmail.com"☃"I'm a big fan of sci-fi, and If theres any genre that ZZT was just made for, it's the interactive movie. Why then, such an average score? <br /><br />After loading up the game, quitting to set the speed a setting higher (This is normally a must with games that don't use text boxes at all), I watch a movie. Then another movie. After this, I start walking around, this is a pleasant change, not because I hate movies, but because the plot and dialouge where incredibly cardboard and while I don't expect fight club, I wouldn't mind something a little better than spy kids. <br /><br />As wells said (I think), if you're going to make an I-cinema game, then good for you, but you MUST make sure you concentrate on making the plot interesting. No amount of fancy graphics or engines will change an I-cinema game that has a plot this slow or obvious. The game was maybe to short for a plot twist, but that wouldn't stop Quantum from thinking up something a little more realistic. Two teenagers get up, go to a mall, enlist in an army and at the end go to bed. I dunno, the whole 'Teenagers save the world' thing is a bit saturday morning television for my tastes. You could of course say code red ran along similar lines, but let's not forget I really don't like code red much, either. <br /><br />Outside of the plot, the game ran pretty smooth with a few exceptions. While the other engines where original, fun and not annoying, the RPG battles where awful. Or should I say the first one was. I seemed to miss everything, and I was very close to zapping through, which I very rarely do on a game I intend to review. This engine to suffers from a lack of realisim. Taking longer to destroy a bully than it does a group of three terrorists - even if you use a revolver on the bully and a knife on the terrorists - seems a bit crazy to me. <br /><br />The worst thing about the game? Much like my last reviewed game by Commodore, this game uses USELESS 'Object follows you around' coding, which does NOTHING but look bad, annoy the hell out of most people, and slow everything down. It wasn't majorly buggy, but pushing an object out of my way all the time is not my idea of fun. Worse still, the object had some critical programming, meaning I couldn't just zap it and get on with my day. I hope this isn't going to be a trend. <br /><br />Again, to semi-repeat Wells, this IS NOT a bad game, it's certainly playable to people who like I- cinema games, but it's nothing like the 'WARTORN-ish' game that Dr. Dos describes. Quantum needs to focus either on PLOT if OGV wishes to be an I-cinema game in the future, or non-engine gameplay if it does not. Either way, there's a lot of promise here, but don't expect the world. Not yet, anyway. "☃"1030654773"☃"oprgv1.zip"☃"3"☃
"A christmas Gone Horribly, Horribly Wrong"☃"Moonpie"☃☃"Ok. I load up the game, and get presented with two colors that remind me of X-MAS...Red, and green. They have been given that &quot;3D&quot; look by adding a normal next to a solid, to create the words &quot;XMAS SPECIAL&quot;. The music is horrid. I literally wanted to crap my pants just so I could get away from the thought of the random assorted beeps going through my head. Yecch. <br /><br />Now, the real strength in this game is the gameplay. Oh, whoops, did I say gameplay? I meant *DELETING THE GAME*. Seriously, why would I want to sit around and look at a motionless board filled with seemingly UNFUNNY dialouge? I don't even want to continue to review this game, that is HOW BAD it really is.

"On the Wire"☃"Commodore"☃☃"One of the first games I downloaded from this site. Draco originally came up with the concept and the first few boards. Then he left. Nadir picked it up from where he left off. He did a good job imitating both his graphical style and his comedy. I honestly can't tell when he picked up. <br /><br />But less about the history of the game and more about the story. The game takes place in a town where for many generations its inhabitants have tourmented by a demons and beasts flowing out of a crypt. You, the stranger, have come to save them for some reason. <br /><br />The game quickly cuts to the chase with no unnecessary cinimatics or boards. The game is a dungeon game. Some people are turned off by simple exploratory games with very little dynamic. Sure you do the same things: shoot the demon, search the body, grab a arrow, light a torch, and contuinue on. But what makes this game stick is it is able to create a mood. The widespread use of the colour red really makes the game feel cool. Adding to that are the tons of mangled bodies you find and their darkly comic discriptions. <br /><br />The ending is a bit thin, and unless the other game i'm thinking about came after it, it's been done before. But it is well drawn,( i like how you can see that guy's spine ) <br /><br />My only complaint is that mid-way through the levels there wasn't a part that fowarded to story any, and that in the later level there was no simple way out except the way you came in. Well, i suppose it's more realistic that way."☃"1030655022"☃"wire.zip"☃"4"☃
"Nexus: Future's Past"☃"Commodore"☃☃"Nexus takes place in the future where they have discovered how to traverse time. The technology has been used for studying different cultures in Earth's past. At the begining of the game you find out that aliens far more advanced that humans, have set up military bases in different places in time and your mission is to destroy them. <br /><br />Well It's hard to do a time traveling game without someone comparing it to Chrono Wars. So I'll let some other reviewer do that. <br /><br />Instead I'll touch on the graphics. Well there isn't much of that. No, but seriously, Liver (can i use just Liver? I like to use nouns for names...) Liver uses very little range of colour. Its rare when you'll see more than three colours on a board, and when there are more colours, they're usually there because they're the bulit in enemies. The graphics aren't bad, just sparse. Liver uses STK on every board and the graphics never hurt your eyes. Their simplicity actually is quite pleasing on the eyes. <br /><br />The gameplay seems to play the secondary to the plot. It seems as though Liver had this idea in his/her head for a game and wanted to get it all down as quickly as possible before he/she forgot. The game uses a lot of built in enemies. The most abundant being catapillars which is the first trap the majority of zzters fall into. (They are pretty cool, just boring after the fifth one with 25+ segments.) <br /><br />So to sum up. <br /><br />Liver made the story of primary importance (you can tell by the long scrolls of information pumped at you.) Game play seems rushed and at some times Sweenyesque. Graphics sort of ran hand and hand with game play. The story made the game. But i really don't like the paradoxal title. *cough*Back-to-the-future....*Ahem* Excuse me...."☃"1030655131"☃"nexus-1.zip"☃"3"☃

"Psyche"☃"MadTom"☃"madtom@comic.com"☃"Vies with Chickenwire as my favourite Zenith Nadir game. His impeccable skill adds a real finish to the game, with clean, crafted graphics and carefully arranged text. <br /><br />Psyche is a dungeon crawl with a difference. At the start of the game a random choice is made ... will you be given the Nadir path, the serious and TEEN ANGST course, or the Zenith path, with Zenith the showman as we all know him in Chickenwire? It's all up to chance. But whichever way you go first doesn't matter. <br /><br />The Nadir path presents the third-person past tense narrative of a girl named Mir, struggling through a dungeon marked with many dead and gruesomely mutilated bodies. A picture of inner turmoil is painted here. Yet with the odd reflection of Mir's we see a slight hint of Zenith ... a tad of humour. <br /><br />The Zenith path is completely different. Your nameless character is flung into an abyss of complete and utter happy-go-lucky chaos and hilarious disarray. You battle such fierce and fearsome beasts as fleas and tamagochis, and my personal favourite, Incontinence Man (prone to losing control of his bladder when kicked in the appropriate area). <br /><br />At the end of each path you meet its creator ... either Zenith or Nadir. Both end your game ... but in decidedly different ways. <br /><br />The depth of Psyche is something I believe not usually seen in ZZT games. Zenith's characteristic tidy style and amusing insights add a curious charm to the whole game, and it seems very complete. It reveals something about his personal nature, of course; and gives insight into the natures of the two names of our favourite schizophrenic."☃"1030655243"☃"psyche.zip"☃"5"☃
"Psyche"☃"Boonob"☃"boonob@mail.com"☃"There's not much more for me to say, but I agree with MadTom in that it is one of Zen's best games, better than ChickenWire, according to me. <br /><br />I especially enjoyed the Zenith side, mostly the variety of creatures requiring SMITING. There are times even now when I feel like playing it just to kick Incontinence Man in the nads. Also, all the various people and creatures making an appearance in the dungeon is hilarious. <br /><br />Nadir's side is much more serious, with a mysterious character, Mir, who is only truely explained at the end. But yes, Zenith does slip a bit of humour into these caves, frequently in the object titles. <br /><br />Overall, impeccable programming, great design, and a hell of a lot of fun.

"Soccer"☃"Moonpie"☃☃"Let's do this STEP BY STEP. I started by loading the ZZT world. I was presented with a horribly drawn title screen; on which upon I said 'THAT'S WHAT A SOCCER BALL LOOKS LIKE?' Or, atleast I thought it was a soccer ball. Might have been some creepy face that you would find on the wall of the haunted mansion in disneyland. No matter, let us continue. I pressed P, and was greeted with &quot;SNIKA PRODUCTIONS&quot;, which was basically randomly drawn lines put together, and in the middle it said the title of the company. I quickly scuttled to the next board. <br /><br />The menu system was easy to use, and easily made. Move the cursor UP/DOWN and then pick a target, which the cursor promply shoots it. My first choice was the 'about' section, because that's what it told me to do. I realized there was some music playing. Horrible music, sounded like it was made with a random ZZM creator. Literally, the high notes were very far apart from the low ones, so there were seemingly random &quot;BEEP BEEP&quot;s every now and then. Ok, blahalah, lets talk about the tutorial. <br /><br />The tutorial made the game seem really, well, NON-SOCCER-BASED. Also, it didn't teach me anything, except how to use ?+K. Lets move on. <br /><br />The game was OK, even an attempt at a plotline, which you rarely see in sports-style games. I guess I entered a tournament and I was destined to become a soccer champ, or something. So, I enter the brown passage behind the counter, and I get a board with a soccer field on it, and some red/white guys come pouring out. I freaked out, but that wasn't the real game. <br /><br />The engine was simplistic. Walk up to the ball and it moves away from you. Type ?+K and you have 5 seconds to kick the ball, where it then keeps moving until it is touched again, and that includes bouncing off walls. There was about 10 opponents on the other team, and like, 3 on mine, including me. Since there was no real AI in this game, it is very easy to get the ball away from your goal. Getting it in the other is the hard part. The opponents always seem to take the ball before you can do anything with it, and it got so frustrating I quit the game. <br /><br />While this is a good attempt at a sports style game, there is much need/room for improvement.

The engine would be ok if the opponents were a bit smarter... <br /><br />But maybe they were just random in the first level... maybe there was a bit of structure in later arenas... <br /><br />I skipped to the end in the editor where a text box came up to tell me what happened to the player and to tell me the game was over. I quit zzt.... with that horrible music still ringing in my ears... (not like I can do better, and WiL's been avoiding me for months...) <br /><br />Now, It wasn't the worst game I've seen... definately not. The engine was ok like I said, but it could use some work.

This was a daring attempt at a genre that is probably unworkable in ZZT, and it inevitably falls short. On the bright side, it's unpretentious, it lacks the usual assortment of totally random, theoretically humorous enemies, and it's a nice try for one's coffee break. If better AI were possible, &quot;Soccer&quot; could be a lot of fun. <br /><br />As it is... well, it was a nice try. "☃"1030655685"☃"soccergamesnika.zip"☃"3"☃

"NO!"☃"Commodore"☃☃"A game that deserves the GOTM award if not solely for the last battle screen. <br /><br />No! is an arena style game that surpasses practically all that I have played. The graphics are simple but it fits for the mood. The plot gives the game a reason to be played and adds to allowing _God_ to get away with trippy type sequences, which work, unlike in some game where trippy is all in how you make flashy things and confusing text. <br /><br />Yet this is not for really Trippy game players, its very much an action game. You fight many monsters in various arena settings to progress. The arenas are different though. Some are small, some large. Some are randomly generated. Each arena is different but the same. I can only compare it to haveing a selection of fine wines to test. <br /><br />Some arena games get tedious. No! only does so in one spot. (The breakout board) Otherwise, it's timed beutifully, because when it finally does get tedious, the section you're in usually ends. <br /><br />No!'s ability to strech from arena, to randomly generated dungeon, to RPG engine, just makes the game just that much more enjoyable. And just when you think that the last boss is going to make you shoot it out with him.... it ends up much differntly. <br /><br />A well crafted game with few flaws and good replay value. Makes me feel bad that No! 2 seemed to stall in 2001..."☃"1030656318"☃"No.zip"☃"4"☃

Other questionable design decisions, such as a vexing hunger system and a need for even good characters to consume the raw bodies of their fallen enemies, seem to have been put in to artificially extend the game's length. <br /><br />Bottom Line: A so-so execution of a good idea"☃"1030656673"☃"ikfrpg.zip"☃"3"☃
"Warlock Domain"☃"Commodore"☃☃"Warlock Domain was a great game. It combined the cutesy adventure of a Sierra adventure game, with the swords and spells of Final Fantasy to create a wonderful atmosphere. <br /><br />I downloaded this game after my post for the best RPG engine. I must agree that this is a very well done engine. Even though its not featured until about halfway through the game, the engine is the crowning glory of the game. The last boss (to me it looked inspired by Neo-Exdeath of FF5), was the only RPG battle I have ever played in ZZT that was actually intense. I almost wanted to give a standing ovation to Mr. Chan afterwards. But that wouldv'e been wierd in my room.... <br /><br />The game is more than the battle. The story, whilst in the begining is sterotypical, ends with a good twist. The puzzles, are original and all progress the story quite nicely without being too hard. The ending, is good but goes on for quite a while. <br /><br />I can't say much for the music. The title music is all right, and the opening music is a decent copy of the music in Final Fantasy when you cross the bridge in FF1, or just before you fight Zeromus in FF4. The battle music is pretty good and drives the gameplay and the music playing during the ending is okay except after a while it gets a bit annoying. <br /><br />So my suggestion is to download this game and reminice about kicking the crap out of Chaos. And if you know, who Chaos is, you've played too many video games...."☃"1030656894"☃"warlock.zip"☃"5"☃

But when he reaches the front door, a smart young fellow with a smart mouth decides it's time to teach you who the real lord of the dance is.<br /><br />Now is a good time to explain the Dance Battler engine. It's your typical &quot;RPG&quot; engine, as seen in older games such as Legends of Jaconia 3. You select one of three dance moves, one damaging your opponent's &quot;Dance-o-Meter&quot;, one damaging your own, and one...er...that does one of the two, again. All the battles seen in the game are exactly the same, so things get a bit repetitive in this section.<br /><br />Eventually, you use your dancing shoes to prove his &lt;3 belongs 2 u. He backs off, intimidated, and you enter your girlfriend's house! But what other fiends will hinder you? A good few!<br /><br />The music is lacking. The graphics are even moreso.

The story was engaging enough and the varity of locations traveled kept it interesting. Wartorn's only draw back is it's battle system. The battles are too dependant on randomisation so that in one battle you can kick an unfair amount of ass and in the next not even get off more than two good hits. Other than that there were a lot of good things. Size being one of them. For an adventure game it was niether to long or too short. Madguy landed the length on the mark.

"School ZZT"☃"My Liver Hurtz"☃"myliverhurtz@yahoo.ca"☃"When I first played this game I really thought it was a joke. However, after closer examination on the Z2 website I discovered the genre was in fact &quot;Adventure&quot;, not &quot;Comedy&quot; &quot;Joke&quot; or &quot;What not to do in a ZZT game&quot; <br /><br />Why do I say this? Hmm... where to begin. <br /><br />Let's try sound. Sorry, no sound <br /><br />OK, how about graphics? This program's terrain is 99.9% solids that varry in colour. <br /><br />Plot, what plot? Seriously, the player doesn't even know why he/she is trying to escape a deserted school. I don't think there's even a dialog box that pops up, ANYWHERE. <br /><br />Well, I have to give stampede this: he is VERY creative. It only took me editing the game to find out that sureal looking hallway was ACTUALLY a flight of stairs. I found out this by looking at the board title. <br /><br />How do you win? You have to walk down a certain corridorr and enter a room that says &quot;You win!&quot;<br /><br />However, there are another 2 corridorrs that if you go in one of them the exact same board comes up except it says &quot;You lose!&quot; <br /><br />I'm having a hard time comprehending how this thing got into the databse. It's 1/3 the minimum .zip file size, and it uses NO other colours besides the 7 provided. <br /><br />PROS: <br />*Very funny to look at and play. <br />*Gives you the satisfaction that no matter how bad your game is, School of ZZT is 10 times worse.<br />*The game's only 10 boards, so it's easier to peek through the game and find out what the room are supposed to be. <br />*Only having to defeat 10 lions that are all placed in one room reduces the stress on your shift key <br /><br />CONS: <br />*No plot <br />*No music <br />*No graphics.

He could not just wait his turn like all the others.<br /><br />Anyway, with personal preferences aside, this is the best game ever.

"The Living Dead"☃"Fishfood"☃"misanthropyrules@hotmail.com"☃"Few people yet know of the new ZZTer, Commodore, but already he is making a name of himself in the community. I feel it's my duty to acknowledge the few newbies who I believe have the potential to make great games, and highlight their skills and weaknesses before it's too late and they give up, and fade away. <br /><br />Commodore isn't someone the community wants to be fading away too soon. Let me get this straight though, The Living Dead is not a great game in itself, but it's the prospect of future games and the skills it showcases that make it worthwhile. It was made under the company name of 'Mirror Image Games', which is basically a partnership between Commodore and a fellow newbie Snika. While it remains to see if Snika can achieve this level of quality on his games, Commodore certainly has jumped the first hurdle. <br /><br />On to the game then. In living dead you play a man called John Williams, who goes to answer a cry for help after being attacked by a zombie in his car. The game continues from there, and levels of stupidity get higher as the plot continues. It's not BAD stupidity, it's b-movie stupidity and in the majority of places, it feels right. The scene in the house is great, and the scene in the shed was actually rather brilliant, the sound effects and graphics really came together for the first (and only) time. <br /><br />Graphics wise, the game varies in skill from the rather primitive shading of the interiors to the pretty object drawn stain glass windows of a church. There's a lot of a path and a lot of trees that seem to look like a scene from SPRG after a while. The sound is also eclectic, ranging from the awful title screen music to the creepy music in the shed, it's not a good idea to keep it on all the time. <br /><br />Gameplay wise, there isn't really much here, unfortunatly. Long walking scenes serve to extend the playing time, but battles for the most part use ZZT's shooting engine and offer nothing new or exciting, and only just keep you away from plot long enough to keep going. Bosses are annoying but bareable, and have the appopriate attacks. The talking scenes are more fun, with the dialouge as cheesy as the plot itself and the game moving at a nice pace. While Commodore lists Romero as an influence, I feel it plays more like 'Evil Dead' than 'Night of the Living Dead. It didn't have such a huge scale as the latter, and the more blunt comedy was also evident. <br /><br />The only two things to really complain about was the way you swapped characters without being told, which confused me a little to begin with, and the way the people followed behind you. In a normal RPG, a char will just #die and a flag will be set they are in the party, but in TLD your partner follows you around, making for buggy walking and annoying times when they get stuck. There's no real reason for it, and it ruins the flow of the game to shoot your partner and have him re-appear on the next board. <br />It's not enough to stop playing, but it is enough to annoy very quickly. <br /><br />In summary, Commodore is destined to go far once he Hones his skils a little. I see in him a young Madtom, and like Madtom, his skills are improving very rapidly, but he still has a long way to go from his rather horrible 'Ghostbusters Demo' to making a renowned game like Burgular. However, I don't wish to hype him as the NEXT anybody, and his future in the community is what he makes it. I wish him the best of luck and hope he continues to improve and make more ZZT games.

"Sim: Life"☃"Fishfood"☃"misanthropyrules@hotmail.com"☃"Everybody has their 'wannabes'. Knightt has starbux, Cronos has scorch, and drac0 has 'master raze'. The first Raze game I played, whose name I cannot remember, is probably exactly what chickenwire would play like if it was mixed with teen priest, and all the elements of humour and gameplay where removed. To be fair, he has improved since then. Just not by much. <br /><br />Of course, when someone of mediocre skill makes a game based on such a tired and ulitmatly pointless concept of 'live', you just know it's going to be pretty bad. And it is, but in a suprising way! This isn't really a sim life game at all. Sure, its title IS sim: life, but a more apt name would run something like 'Master raze's adventures in hitting puberty'. I can't make any real presumptions about Raze's real life, but it seems the game to be less of a fictional story and more of what raze wishes his life would be like. <br /><br />When I play a sim life game, i expect it to generally resemble life in some way or another. I'm not saying it has to be exactly the same as mine, but it should be at least realistic. You know, wake up, breakfast, work (REAL work), maybe go out or stay at home and watch TV. The character should be a real person, not some 'player' who sounds like they've just been dreampt up by the writers of american pie. I want to be rejected by women. I want to lose my car keys and only realise 2 minutes before I have to leave for work. I want to take my dog to the vet. Yes, that would make a for a boring game, but life sims are MEANT to be boring and crappy, becuase LIFE is boring and crappy. <br /><br />Adding pornography and drugs doesn't really do much for the game other than to further prove that raze doesn't know much about either women or narcotics. Wells has already mentioned the most tedious parts of the banal gameplay, so I won't go into that. It does have its good points. It's good some pretty good graphics, and it's Razes best game so far. The latter, of course, doesn't really say much. "☃"1030659462"☃"simlife.zip"☃"1"☃
"Sim: Life"☃"John W Wells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"Master Raze's Sim: Life provides an unflinchingly stark look into the life of a promiscuous, drug- addicted, perverse idiot. A welcome departure from Raze's usual themes of sex and death, S:L carefully explores the grimy worlds of sex and drugs. <br /><br />The goal of the game is simple - you must accrue 300 &quot;creativity points&quot; and 300 &quot;experience points&quot; to marry the girl of your dreams. To gain these points, you must take up odd jobs, such as impersonating a priest and giving a supposedly funny (and very derivative) confessional, and engage in intercourse, social and otherwise, with a variety of women. <br /><br />There's a catch, though. Every few seconds, you lose a bit of health due to hunger. So you also need money to pay for food; standing still for five minutes is a recipe for disaster. That's right. Sim: Life is every bit as hectic, stressful, and repetitive as real life. Talk about realism! <br /><br />What money you don't spend on food you can use to buy drugs, which grant creativity points (crack: it does a body good), purchase pornographic magazines, which apparently disintegrate after a single reading, or trade in firearms. The net result of this slew of transactions is that the game boils down to a complex math problem. <br /><br />&quot;Let's see... I have 30 creativity points, so I can do some stand-up comedy and get 45 dollars, which I can use to buy a pistol to sell for a 5 dollar, 2 exp, and 2 creativity point profit. Then I can go and buy a pornographic magazine, return home, and get more experience, but oh, man. I can't buy food then. Maybe if I go to the prostitute who trades 25 money for a bit of EXP first... &quot; <br /><br />The above sort of thought sequence repeats over, and over, and over, as it takes a long, repetitive time to get 300 EXP and creativity points. You can speed the process by taking a few &quot;errand boy&quot; jobs, but it doesn't help much. Perhaps I'm missing some way of getting 200 creativity points in one go, but I don't see it. <br /><br />What, then, is good about Sim: Life? Well, it does have a few funny moments - although one would hope for more, given that Raze doesn't pull any punches here, and it does have an interesting concept, a few nice sequences, and a decent premise. My recommendation: Play until you have 100 EXP and creativity, and you'll probably have seen the best of what there is to see. "☃"1030659512"☃"simlife.zip"☃"3"☃

Thus, five powerful eastern US cities are merged into one huge super-metropolis - New Earth Operations, or N-E-O. In a world with genetic engineering in humans prevalent, particularly in the army, and the intense competition between the US and China, you are either Ace, a genetically enhanced super-soldier for the United States GEC, or Blade, an unidentified man with a very obscure past and unnatural abilities. <br /><br />In Ace's introduction, you are pursuing a nuclear terrorist through the lesser parts of N-E-O, and in Blade's, attempting an escape (one of the hardest boards to complete of any game I've played) from an ERG (the Chinese genetic engineering company) compound."☃"1030659695"☃"neo1.zip"☃"5"☃

"New Earth Operations Part 1"☃"Commodore"☃☃"I played this game by pure chance, just going around and downloading random games. I must say that this game is the most original piece of ZZT gold that I have ever seen. The graphics are astounding and the concept is brilliant. The smallest details add to the value of this game in every way, such as the stock ticker during the news cast. <br /><br />It has only a few faults, but they are big ones. The instant kills are every where. Some are very understandable(walking in front of a sniper) but others are just annoying (running too close to the enemy.) The second flaw, it's very hard, unfairly so, especially Blade's half of the game. The reason for this is the steep learing curve. Right from the start you have no idea what to do. I was killed so many times the escape key began to fade. However, and this happened only once to me and was really cool, suddenly instinct kicks in, and you know exactly what to to, you sense the trap and you feel like an action hero when you avoid it... <br /><br />The best part of the game, outside of the brilliant graphics that make even a veteran ZZTer cry, is the multitude of engines. The game just never becomes boring, frusterating yes... but even when you've jumped on the same landmine seven times, you still want to play on...."☃"1030659765"☃"neo1.zip"☃"5"☃

"Operation: MOUSE"☃"John W Wells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"Operation: MOUSE is a lot better than Sim: Life and, unlike The Kane Project 2, doesn't take itself too seriously. It's bug-free, and has a few interesting graphical effects. The gameplay isn't too easy or too hard, nor is the game overlong. There are a few laughs in there, too, if you look. <br /><br />The bad news: <br /><br />The writing is atrocious, as the humor and characters generally fall flat, despite a frantic attempt by the author to increase the comedy of scenes by increasing the volume level. Repeated fourth- wall breaking jokes are executed poorly, and the ending is an intentional anticlimax, reducing the game to the level of a pointless shaggy dog story. Endless shaggy dog stories may be fun to tell, but the joke is always on the listener. <br /><br />The gameplay doesn't reveal much of anything new, with the exception of one neatly executed puzzle, and has two thoroughly senseless sequences. In one, you have to touch an object twice for a vital clue, even though you have no reason to touch it _once_., and another sequence requires tedious guesswork. <br /><br />Still, this is a decent game. Just try not to flinch at the cutscenes too much. "☃"1030659953"☃"opMOUSE.zip"☃"3"☃

It was FREEEEEEEEEAKY EEEVIL rainbow colors, giant flower pots flavored like pot bricks, secret boards that mock Flaming Kitty and Skeptisoft, and various OHH DEARS.

But Fishfood and Igsel pull the humour and the wackiness off wonderfully, without making any compromises on graphics, though admittedly they did on music ... deliberately.

"Not THAT bad"☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"I actually enjoyed OO2.<br /><br />There are two ways to play it:<br /><br />1) Charge in, get stars lobbed at you, die, restore, repeat.<br /><br />2) Use a bit of stealth, sneak past the enemies, &quot;Thief&quot;-style, and be VERY careful. Oh, and remember that cameras can see through walls. There's a way of getting around the last part, but it involves modifying code.<br /><br />(Note to Bramlage: Have cameras check #if blocked seek before sounding the alarm and sending the killer robots to wipe out the player.)<br /><br />The second method is a lot more fun, but I suspect that most people don't try it. <i>(I did, but frankly it was so tiresome and finicky that the game became even more irritating than it had been previously. - Funk)</i><br /><br />The plotline is, as Funk mentioned, very, very weak, but this isn't that unusual for a ZZT game. The cutscene graphics are odd, and often sketchy, but have a bit of atmosphere to them that I found surprisingly... acceptable.<br /><br />Whether or not you enjoy OO2 depends on whether or not you really, really like stealth gameplay, and don't mind severe logic lapses."☃"1030733094"☃"o-obrian2.zip"☃"3"☃

"About as good as he next game. So long as the next"☃"Funk"☃"Wilko_3000@yahoo.com"☃"After the entertaining Wartorn and the tremendous Burger Joint, people's expectations were incredibly high for this game. Consequently, its release resulted in claims by almost everyone that it was Matt's bast game, and one of &lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt; best ZZT games ever made.<br /><br />But, of course, almost everyone is STUPID and WRONG, as you will see.<br /><br />The basic set-up of the game (you're in prison for stealing food) is thrown out the window almost immediately, and replaced by two alternate storylines, neither of which is really as funny or interesting as the programmer seems to think.<br /><br />The first is a spoof of Titanic, except even less funny than what you're imagining right now. For example, the ship is called &quot;Dietanic&quot;. Get it? Because lots of people died on the Titanic, and it rhymes with &quot;Titanic&quot; and &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;! Guffaw! And the girl's name is Nose! Because that sounds like Rose!<br /><br />I'm not making this up, you know.<br /><br />The second plot is a parody of various things, including the Wizard of Oz, and ends with the player talking to the creator of the game himself. What comedy! Sorry, that should read &quot;What? &lt;i&gt;Comedy?&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />Okay so it's been pretty negative so far. Anything good? Well, the graphics are quite nice. Yup.<br /><br />Right, that's out of the way, back to tearing this to shreds:<br /><br />*The dialogue is lame, and characters have no personality outside of their accents.<br />*The gameplay is pretty much nonexistant. Aside from the odd action scene it's just a case of wandering about talking to everyone and hoping the &quot;plot&quot; progresses soon.<br />*The jokes, as I've mentioned, are awful.<br /><br />Still, the game is only 33% what MadGuy originally envisioned, so I guess we lucked out on that other 67%."☃"1030752850"☃"nextgame.zip"☃"1"☃

A young lad is born and because he is somehow different in some unspecified way, (lazy plotting, there) he realises that he is living in a puppet society.<br /><br />So our kid grows up, runs away with the personality-free love interest and lives happily ever after. &lt;i&gt;Great&lt;/i&gt;.

His hair is soft and fragrant, like mice dipped in Chanel no. 5. His skin is the most delightful chamois one could hope to touch. Looking into his eyes is like looking into deep, unfathomable pools of ocular jelly, and his teeth are whiter than his audience.<br /><br />But no! To talk any longer on the dreaminess of David is folly. For here on this CD is a collection of music so divine that it brings tears to my eyes and a lump to my trousers. David's singing skills are so expansive and so experimental that he eschews mere &quot;notes&quot; and &quot;keys&quot; and instead rockets into whole new realms of sound. One minute he sings with the manly grumble of an ox crushed by a pneumatic piston - the next he has the graceful strength of someone sledgehammering blowfish. Soaring vocals go higher than any mountain climber could, even if he had wings and was in a space shuttle. Then just as quickly they swoop down like a suicidal Japanese businessman, hitting the sidewalk with a biological thump. Beats swirl around like kittens in a washing machine as a series of dancing mosquitos tinkle like triangles stapled to a dormouse. Crumbling walls become dirt-trodden werewolves and the flitting, spritely air of a gibbon can be heard in the distance. And then track 2 begins!<br /><br />Just look at his experimental titles too - &quot;Du&quot; (you), &quot;Je T'Aime Means I Love You&quot; (I love you means I love you), &quot;Wir Zwei Allein&quot; (I am two Alans) and &quot;Danice Dance d'Amour&quot; (Dennis and his Dancing Armour).

And if you didn't find it hot, you know what you'd be.<br /><br />With the money you gain doin' shit like that, you buy food and shit, and you can even fuck some cum guzzling gutter sluts down at the ywca, which is also fuckin' hot.<br /><br />So after about 8 days of straight playin', you have enough points to finish the game. And how do you finish the game? Why, you go down to this fuckin' bitch's house and you FUCK HER IN HER FUCKIN' FUCK HOLE! and it's HOT!!!!!!!<br /><br />Anyway, Master Razed in Black, even though you're named after a band full of plunger suckin' fags, you can make a damn good game, so you're a bad motherfucker in my book. Let's hook up after I get off my shift some day and go find us some sluts."☃"1031022667"☃"simlife.zip"☃"5"☃"172.180.213.6"
"wot a bov!"☃"triphEd"☃"triphEd@yahoo.com"☃"this has got to be my favourite ZZT game of all time. i love the humor and craziness of WiL's work. you just have to look at places like 'the sock library' to know that it's going to be a funny game to play. plus, there's a TON of quotes to remember from it. not as much impact as something like 'halucina', but good all the same. it also had me saying 'bov' for weeks...<br />the font that it uses is quite a nifty feature too, and WiL's coding is impeccable. and the music will stick in yo' head! forever!!"☃"1031041913"☃"bananaq.zip"☃"5"☃"213.106.156.94"
"Banana Quest"☃"Fishfood"☃"misanthropyrules@hotmail.com"☃"It's safe to say this is WiL's best game. It's also pretty safe to say this is the most overrated game since Chrono wars, and it's not even half as good. <br /><br />Of course, the graphics and the sound are AWESOME, don't get me wrong. Very few people can even begin to approach WiL in those catagories. However, everybody has their weaknesses, and WiL's are pretty huge.<br /><br />The game has virtually no plot, other than that which Wells mentioned, and it doesn't help that what plot it has is interspersed with words and sentences I think only WiL understands, and stupid catchphrases that really got on my nerves. 'But what about YAY SIRS' fishfood, I hear you cry. Let's remember though, I wasn't TRYING to sound funny or get my phrases to be popular, WiL is trying. Way, way to hard.<br /><br />Wells calls this game trippy. It's not, at all. There is a fine line between trippy and dumb, and this review is far on the dumb side. It's to straight and boring to be trippy to and to retarded to be serious. Of course thats when you get to play the game, which primarilly consits of ENGINE, another ENGINE and then another ENGINE and then some walking and then game over.<br /><br />Addictive? No. Tedious and boring? Hell yes.<br /><br />In short, it's a typical WiL game. Totally unbalanced, with some of the best graphics and music you'll ever see, but nobody goes far on eye candy, and WiL is too busy trying to be funny to bother making any kind of plot. Emphasis on the word 'trying' there.<br /><br />"☃"1031082912"☃"bananaq.zip"☃"3"☃"212.140.113.106"

I cite it as a wonderful example of what can be done with ZZT in the realm of storytelling.<br /><br />In this story, Ian -aka. Kid Action, the city's beloved teenage superhero- plays the part of the protagonist, and is blackmailed into a revenge sceme by the jealous WiL. But in this story, as in life, no one person is ever always the good guy or the bad guy, and any love that comes before Super Smash Brothers is no love at all.<br /><br />So, because of the humour, plot, and utter delight this story -I doubt any can presume to refer to it as a game- I feel compelled to give it the highest score possible, despite its brief length.<br />"☃"1031150750"☃"therose.zip"☃"5"☃"216.20.132.86"

"Warning: spoilers for &quot;Apud&quot; and &quot;W"☃"Funk"☃"wilko_3000@yahoo.com"☃"I dunno. Maybe it's just me, but Wayward's games always seem vastly overrated. His plots are melodramatic where plain drama would be preferable, and though they're usually based around a solid central concept they always feel like missed opportunities.<br /><br />Take Within, for example, which almost everyone creamed themselves over - the basic idea (dreams and reality bleeding into each other) was great, but the characterisation was lame and the actual plot just ambled around until the sudden and preposterous ending. I'd hoped with Apud that Wayward would have developed a little, but sadly no.<br /><br />Basically, you play Wayward ( a little self-obsessive don't you think?). Having committed suicide, you float between heaven and hell, and your actions in the game - good or evil - determine which ending you get. Basically this amounts to walking left and right around a looping playfield, using objects in basic fetch-and-retrieve quests until you just can't be bothered, or find anything else to do. Then you just &quot;ascend&quot; and watch your fate be decided. You can actually ascend at any time in the game, though obviously you stand a better chance of going to Heaven if you play properly.<br /><br />The graphics are pretty damned nice, and certainly an improvement on Within. There are also quite a few nice touches - the subliminal message gag and the aging house occupants being just two - but none of these distract from the pedestrian gameplay or uninvolving plot.<br /><br />Which brings me back to one of my initial points - the idea of someone drifting between two worlds could have been genuinely interesting, but here it's just a bunch of cameos and silly puzzles. For example, Wayward could have used a fictional character and had his struggle in limbo reveal details about his friendships and past, and what drove him to suicide. But no, it's CAMEOS AHOY!<br /><br />Well okay, I guess that's what Wayward wanted, but it is somewhat annoying to hear people going on about what a genius game it is when all I can see is one big missed chance."☃"1031343741"☃"apud.zip"☃"1"☃"195.93.33.11"
"Butt"☃"My Liver Hurtz"☃"myliverhurtz@yahoo.ca"☃"This was one of the first ZZT games I downloaded, and to tell you the truth I did like it to an extent.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil the plot for you, it's far too interesting to do that.<br /><br />Graphics: Blokeware uses almost every colour available, and to tell you the truth it hurt my eyes on some boards because of the contrast. Then again, my eyes are a lot more light-sensitive then most peoples'.<br /><br />Gameplay: Gameplay to this game is very simple, and annoying at some parts. I didn't like the invisisble maze, it reminded me to much of Tomb Radier: Pyramid of Power(*shudder*)<br /><br />Blokeware uses a lot of humour, especially about devouring carcases and pieces of flab. i particularly don't like this type of humour, but I know a lot of other people do. I'm a more serious person myself.<br /><br />The game also has one very big bug, Blokeware did not connect a board on a boss' room, thus you cannot possible advance without cheating/editing the game in advance of entering the board.<br /><br />All in all this game is worth a download.

I just  quickly typed up my own batch file to load the font and it worked perfectly. The graphics in this game are amazing, especially the teleporter effect.<br /><br />The game's plot is fairly simple: it's 2000 years from today, and so far humankind has only sent out a handfull of ships outside of our solar system. None of them have come back. It's up to you to Captain the USS Era, and find out what phenomenon is outside of our system and return home safetly.<br /><br />Game terminology in the game lead me to believe that this was somewhat based off of Star Trek.

"A True Master of the Dark Arts"☃"double berry"☃"youthofnausea@aol.com"☃"I am a veteran RPGer, and I must say that Final Fantasy ZZT, the latest game in Fishkarrde's masterpiece is definately the best that I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Some RPGers were very disapointed, and consider FFZZT a failure in the world of RPGs, yet I STRONGLY disagree... I will share my opinions in this review. <br /><br />Graphics - This is definately the point I judge RPGs the least on, but nonetheless, Final Fantasy ZZT definately delivers in this catagory. The pre-rendered backgrounds are absolutely outstanding, easily the best in any video game I've seen to date (and this is a year after it's been out!) The polygons are EXACTLY what I like in RPG characters... they are based off of Skullie's amazing art, and capture SD anime art VERY well, much better than what I've seen of Chase's in the Final Fantasy ZZT X demo. They move VERY well, with great body language throughout. You really feel like you control the character. I remember thinking in past RPGs such as Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 6 (3 in the US) things like &quot;Well why can't Chrono jump on top of this thing?&quot; or &quot;Gosh! Why won't the game let Locke climb across this rock?&quot; or whatever. In FFZZT, I didn't feel that way at all, and felt in complete control of my character. The FMV is absolutely amazing, and, once again, is STILL the best I've seen. It blends flawlessly with the actual gameplay, to create an absolutely amazing storytelling environment. These graphics do not hurt the score at ALL, unlike some gamers, as these are still the best graphics I've seen in not just an RPG, but any GAME to date. (and yes, I've played alot of games since then) <br /><br />Music - While not as important as say, gameplay or story, this is an extremely important aspect of any RPG. Guess what? FFZZT delivers. I feel that this soundtrack is Fish's finest work, even outdoing any previous Final Fantasy games (FF4-5-6) and Chrono Trigger, which he helped to work on. Songs such as One Winged Faggot, the Final Ryosuck, Valley of the Sexed-Up Karrde, Trishfood, When Ya Hot Ya Hot, Hey Mr. Wonderful, Kaiser Roll, the ending... I could go on forever! Most all of the songs I listed beat anything on FF6 or CT's soundtrack, which are the two finest video game soundtracks before FFZZT, in my mind. Enough about music, lets move on to... <br /><br />Characters - Karrde did a GREAT job creating the amazing characters of FFZZT. I feel that these are some of the best in any RPG to date, if not the best. It seems as though he took the best of Amano's and Toriyama's styles and talents, and combined them for the characters in FFZZT, and it definately works! Rick Retro and Nick Nostalgia are two of the deepest video game characters ever made, and all of the other playable characters develope strongly in FFZZT, while in games such as Chrono Trigger, FF6, FF5, or FF4, not all of the characters develope, only the main one(s). In FFZZT, even characters such as Cait Sith and Togepy have very memorable and touching moments, while I can't recall any such as that about Mog, Umaro, Gogo, or Antonio Banderas. :o| Also, FFZZT features LOADS of side characters. YOu might have to take notes to keep track of them all! I'll bet there are almost 100 characters given names in this game, that each have an important role in the story, and you must keep track of them all to get the full effect. Outstanding job, Karrde! <br /><br />Gameplay - one of the most important aspects of an RPG is the gameplay, as you will get in MANY battles throughout the game. If those aren't fun, it spoils the gaming experience. Once again, FFZZT delivers. It takes the best qualities of all of the previous Fish games: the defined characters of FF4, the amazing customization of FF5, the exciting battles of FF6, the strategy and fun of Chrono Trigger, and puts combines them all into this one game. I feel it takes the best aspects, and it does create quite a package. The battles are fun and interesting, and don't get as old as some RPGs. ::COUGHCOUGHCHASEBRAMBLEBUSHCOUGHCOUGH:: The Oralsexia system offers great customization, but puts severe limits on what characters can use, unlike FF6. Also, while there are some overpowerful Oralsexia (Knights of the Mouth and 4x Cock, mainly) they either take FOREVER to get or require LOADS of AP to level up to be useful. The Anus Break system is one of the best I've ever seen. I mean, if you are in a fight, and you are being beaten, you are probably gonna get upset enough eventually to really take it to the guy. That's how anus breaks work! As you get hit, a little meter fills up. When it reaches the top, you get to unleash a super-powerful attack on the ememies, causing LOADS of damage to the boss' anus, and usually finishing off a random sexing right then. Overall, when you combine the great customization, character definition in battle, enjoyment, strategy, etc. in FFZZT's battles, it creates a package unmatched in RPG gameplay. <br /><br />Story - WOW! This is easily the best story in any RPG I've ever played... no contest! It is VERY complex, can be taken on many many different levels, is always exciting and fast paced, never gets boring, and requires several play throughs to really understand! It is VERY deep, and has lots of very complex symbolism, that you won't get without spending a few hours at the library. The loads of characters, great side plots and extra things to do, addictive gameplay, outstanding secrets, and AMAZING setting (graphics, music, dialogue) all add up to the best story I've ever seen in an RPG, and one of the best I've ever heard, PERIOD! Far superior to all of its predecessors and RPGs of the company (or ANY company. Including Xenogears, FFTactics, FF4-5-6, Chrono Trigger, Dragon Quest 6, Star Ocean, etc), FFZZT's story is a VERY memorable one, and I can't imagine a better one. With themes of love, hope, courage, destiny, and all around life, it has something for everyone! <br /><br />Overall - FFZZT seems to be the product of every Fish RPG before it: it takes the best elements of each, a $30 million budget, a staff in the hundreds, and 3 years of time, and we get FFZZT, the best video game ever made. PLEASE do yourself a favor and get this game! Even if you don't like RPGs, I PROMISE you that you WILL like them after FFZZT! :o) DO YOURSELF A FAVOR! GET FFZZT!

"esc s enter #restart"☃"Funk"☃"wilko_3000@yahoo.com"☃"Look, I just need to get this out of the way, okay?<br /><br />OMFG THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT OMG OMG OMG!!!<br /><br />There.<br /><br />So yes - lovely graphics. But as with almost every Chase Bramlage game, the gorgeous visuals can't make up for the dreadful, &lt;i&gt;dreadful&lt;/i&gt; gameplay.<br /><br />In the case of  NEO, you're tossed from subgame to subgame with only the tiniest fraction of a second before your character is horribly killed by snipers/mines/guards/whatever. There are no helpful explanations of what to expect on each screen, just a brief few seconds before you're tapping the ESC key and glowering at your monitor. Chase's games seem to be less a test of the player's skills and more some kind of twisted Pavlovian experiment, with the player acting out the part of the salivating dog. Except instead of spit, all you'll have in your mouth at the end of playing is bile.<br /><br />Assuming you can get through the teeth-gratingly difficult five screens allotted to each character, you'll get a passcode for the next disc which - apparently - was never released.<br /><br />The plot is thrown at the player in a 500-word infodump (the lamest of all literary devices) at the start, although it pretty much boils down to &quot;DNDNDNNDNDN SUPER SOLDIERS&quot;. There's virtually no actual plot progression because of the missing second disk and frankly, the only real entertainment comes from Bramlage's laughable spelling (&quot;Washingtom, Philadelpia&quot;).<br /><br />One point for being pretty.

"Apparitions of the SHITTY more like! Ho! Ho! Ho!"☃"Funk"☃"wilko_3000@yahoo.com"☃"When I first reviewed this poetry and art collection, I summed it up as &quot;shitty art + crappy poetry = crappy shit&quot;. However, I was informed by Kev that this did not constitute &quot;constructive criticism&quot;. I shall, then, go through each of the poems one by one, commenting on the poem and the art that goes with it.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;haiku 1&lt;/b&gt;: Actually I kind of like this one, although haikus are so rigid they're hard to fuck up. Does fairly well at evoking an image. But what are the headlights reflecting off? Seriously, I'm not taking the piss - you have to clarify the not immediately obvious. And in a haiku that's not possible, so better to use a less obtuse noun.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;poem 1&lt;/b&gt;: There are a number of generic amateur poem genres. This one is the &quot;taking an ordinary object and making it a thing of beauty&quot; one. In this case, a fluorescent lamp. Sadly, rather than create any original or interesting images, he just hammers down lots of words like &quot;undulating&quot;, &quot;purity&quot; and &quot;celestial&quot; and hopes they sound good. He even uses the word &quot;decadent&quot;, for fucks' sake. This is so much like a parody of generic teen poetry it's not true. The art's just a bunch of white solids, fakes and breakables. Why?<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;haiku 2&lt;/b&gt;: Again, it's hard to fuck up a haiku and again this is quite good. In fact, I'll repeat it in its entirity:<br /><br />&lt;i&gt;purest wind carries<br />our empty shells across the<br />grave mountains downtown&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />See? The restrictive nature of haiku means that Kev can't give in to his teenpoet sensibilities and slap down as many polysyllabic words as he can - he has to choose his words carefully, and this works well. I would, however, have used &quot;bitter&quot; rather than &quot;purest&quot;, if only because it looks less anachronistic given the images and tone of the other lines. I know some might think that it's changing the point of the haiku, but I honestly don't think Kev chose &quot;purest&quot; for any reason other than he thinks it looks kind of impressive in a poem.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;poem 2&lt;/b&gt;: Just when it was going well, it's back to the teenpoetry. Again we're working with a teenpoetry cliche - this time it's the DNDNDNDN GIRL IS PRETTY IN MY DREAMS one. Some of the imagery is more effective here (the image of her floating in a &quot;black wedding dress, eyes blazing&quot; is strong in its simplicity although it is somewhat derivative), but his insistence on using mathematical symbols, parenthesis and misspelling &quot;thru&quot; makes it look like a Radiohead inlay. Predictable use of reverse-metaphor (&quot;the midnight sky shines brighter than the sun&quot;), and tired subject matter (outside world is grey with rain, brightened only by Her beauty). Poor art. Disappointing.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;haiku 3&lt;/b&gt;: Whaddaya know? A crap haiku. Cuts off abruptly, imagery fails to evoke anything in me. Quite the opposite of haiku 2. Beginning to talk like Rorschach.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;poem 3&lt;/b&gt;: A big one. Dull subject matter (looking at the lives of people in NYC) not lightened by verbosity. Again, we get words such as &quot;angelic&quot; used more because they look good than because they mean anything. I mean, New York an &quot;angelically restless and spellbound city&quot;? Restless yes, spellbound you could probably sell me on if the subject of the poem was about uncovering that spell (money? the media?), but ANGELIC? NYC? In fact, calling any city &quot;angelic&quot; is absurd since none of the connotations that the word carries could possibly apply to any city, let alone the most famously badass town of them all. You can't just throw these words about without qualification. <br /><br />Parenthesis and maths symbols continue even (though they) are retarded+annoying. Poor puns that are too wordy to work (the line about transcending and descending).<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;haiku 4&lt;/B&gt;: Boring. Another DNDNDN THIS IS WHAT I IMAGINE IT WOULD BE LIKE TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND poem. Don't tell us that her eyes are &quot;freezing a moment&quot;; that's what the haiku is supposed to BE - a frozen moment of time. Also, don't say &quot;your eyes, intense&quot; - come up with a way of describing the intensity of those eyes. I'm sure you don't want to read a poem about &quot;your shirt, green&quot;. Haiku 2 worked because you said the wind carried your &quot;shells&quot;, not your &quot;bodies&quot;. See? &quot;Shell&quot; implies both the body and its hollowness, emphasises its fragility and that paradox that it's designed to protect. Choose your words more carefully. The best haikus evoke a feeling, not describe it.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;poem 4:&lt;/b&gt; So yeah, there's life in everything, including frickin' parentheses again. Obvious ironic contrast between life and dead things. Dull central concept made duller by the tiresome and formulaic layout of the poem. Rather than offhandedly mention a &quot;skeleton-tree&quot; (a cliche in itself), why not explore that tree and descibe how it lives still or - if that's your point - how the life has left it forver. Also, rather thn use the usual &quot;life sucks, ohh cold weather, death angst&quot; crap (you might as well staple a sign to your head saying &quot;I'm a third-rate teenpoet. Ask me how!&quot;) why not approach it from another angle? Talk about how life will spring from the tree in, er, Spring. Or how those graveyards left untended can become forests (life growing from the remains of death... come on this is - pun not intended - fertile ground). Death for death's sake is just boring.<br /><br />Conclusion, to Kev and everyone else: THINK about what you're putting down on the paper or on the screen. Look at each word. Does it get across what you're trying to say? Are you just writing what's there, or are you writing what you want the reader to feel? <br /><br />Branch out your subjects. Life isn't always grey and miserable, even if you're a teenager. Even Sylvia Plath wrote some wonderfully life-affirming pieces (indeed, they make up about 33% of the Ariel collection). <br /><br />Also, Mark Rothko uses pretty colours.

I hardly ever died, and when I did I looked forward to playing the level again, instead of cursing at my monitor like I would usually do.<br /><br />Music was fairly nonexistant, and I think the doctor mario music would have been appropriate.

"Woah..."☃"Dave2"☃"dragopublish@hotmail.com"☃"Burglar.  It's not a game, It's a saga.  You play Luke Steel, a character who you slowly grow to love.  Luke is into the burglary scene, and decides to join a VERY organized crime.  What other crime underworld holds pick-pocketing competitions?<br /><br />As Luke, you rob houses and apartments, and you're certainly not restricted to a single line of action.  You choose your three pieces of equipment.  You can steal EXTRA objects in order to purchase more &quot;batteries&quot; (which are really torches...).  <br /><br />And after all that, you go on a free style pick-pocket competition.  Where you pick pockets from people.  And it's so cool.  Y'know?<br /><br />And for a game reminiscent of that Old AKware burglary game, the story lines can't even compare.  Burglar! has many characters you actually need to remember, one who's name is &quot;Pique Poquet&quot;.  You actually want to smash in his face after perhaps having lost the competition.<br /><br />The difficulty is quite moderate.  You need to be wise in which items you choose...  Would you pick a gun to invade a totally empty house?  Use your head, kid.  But in the last few levels, you'll be constantly reloading your save files...  The last level is TOUGH!<br /><br />All in all, Burglar was a great game.  It is a game you could play with the pope.  It should be a household item.

"Is that all?"☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"&quot;Attack of the Mole&quot; is an engine game. Its plot is a simple excuse to give the player one board of random dungeon-style combat. It has no real goal, save to kill all the enemies, which promptly respawn, and uses prefab monsters.<br /><br />Clearly, a game like this can be likened to Space Invaders in that the only goal is to get a high score before inevitable dying. Such a game can only survive on its addictiveness; does it make the player _want_ to get a new high score?<br /><br />AotM doesn't, in my opinion. The action is repetitive without being the simple, addictive fun of a game like Tetris, and one particularly unpleasant bug, which wiped out both the ammo sources at once, made the game still less playable.

I really wanted to check it out because Octagon was a great hit with IT'S mentality.  But that's a whole new review.  What I want to say about THIS hard to prenounce titled game is that it enforced both sorrow and hatred within me.  It is a genious game among all genious games.  Not because it is &quot;fun&quot;, but because it both proves a point and deserves to be a book.  Enough of my compliments, now about the game.<br /><br />   I'm going to try to explain this game without spoiling anything.  It opens with a cinema of someone jumping off of a cliff (VERY sad) .  You then start out in some VERY wierd area in which you have MANY options as to what to attempt first.  You go around &quot;doing&quot; stuff for other people.  There are several cameos in it too.  This game's real story doesn't happen unless it's the very beginning or the very end.  You'd think that your character was tripping on acid this whole game or even had downer syndrome, but that is NOT the case.  It is not much to play but to &quot;play&quot;.<br /><br />   Where I am getting at is that this game is a work of pure genious in it's storyline.  It is WayWard's last game...possably so far or for good.  It is sad that someone of this talent in writing has to waste it on ZZT.  THIS is what ZZT is all about in the end!

"Oh, god, please die, Weirdman."☃"Mike Renner"☃"renner@iwo-online.com"☃"Back when I was still alive and actually doing something, I played this game. And, well, I didn't like it. Why?<br /><br />Well, for one thing, it just seemed like Weirdman was trying to say that &quot;Hey, I know, let's make a game using bad #megazeux jokes and references that I probably picked up from the Saga, and then proceed to make it bad!&quot;. If that was the intended goal, then I say &quot;BRAVO, WEIRDMAN, YOU JUST MADE YOUR POINT.&quot;<br /><br />From the very onset, Weirdman was intent on showing that Megazeux was superior to ZZT, from its community on down to the mechanics of the Megazeux editor. Like Terryn, above me, pointed out, he used lots of dated references and jokes no one in their correct mindframe would get. He even went so far as to call booth(the guy who made Bizanloo, Codename Pickle, and Attack of the Smilies) a &quot;newbie&quot;. It was like the guy just stood up and said &quot;Let's just find some ZZTer and call him a newbie&quot;, because Weirdman obviously didn't know what in the fuck he was talking about when he did that.<br /><br />Plus, in my view, completing this game requires me to sit back and wonder something. If you beat the guys making the Megazeux world into an STK-less ZZT... then wouldn't beating the STK-less ZZT create a huge black hole that subsequently ends the world?<br /><br />Or maybe I'm just making that up.<br /><br />Anyway, avoid this game. I think a year in a black prison(assuming most of the readers of this review are white) would be more redeeming than playing this."☃"1033011699"☃"megazeux.zip"☃"0"☃"24.95.116.185"

"Oh my...."☃"Commodore"☃"Jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"    Burgular! was the first game is was impressed with in ZZT. I had just come the the community and Burgular was right there on the front page so I downloaded it. This was also the first ZZT game I had ever seen with STK. So Since the first thing that hit me was the graphics, let's talk about those.<br /><br />From 3/4 perspective streets, to surreal interiors, this game has it all. I've always been partial with mixing surrealism in with normal imagery, and the interior of the company building does just that, two ambigous rooms, and a giant computer. Sitting in what normally would not be a building's shape. Finally the streets where you pick pockets is a wonderful melange of colours that blend in very surreal ways complementing the insanity of the crime you commit. Then we have really well drawn cutscene (granted MadTom is no Chase when it comes to cutscenes) that appear from time to time. <br /><br />As far as music goes, the opening music kicked ass. Sometimes I could rip it into MP3 format. Sadly not much more music was featured.<br /><br />The gameplay was brilliant as well. I personally would've cut down on the instant kills but the last infiltration into the police station was marvelous, with the rooms slowly revealing themsleves and the ingenuity needed to figure out some puzzles (How many games make you remember Chemistry class?) <br /><br />Finally, the story. I loved how you had no regrets throughout the whole game. No internal turmoil shit about the moral implecations of stealing or killing, just fun robbery with a great revenge twist added in.<br /><br />This game INSPIRED me back into the ZZT world. Of course seeing more than 8 colours helped, but the brunt of it was in the careful execution of the game.<br /><br />Thanks MadTom, my hats off to you.<br /><br /> "☃"1033148849"☃"burglar!.zip"☃"5"☃"208.131.211.3"

"Works best as a pack"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"     Bloodlines is one of the best games ZZT has ever made. It proves that you can imitate or even create epic scope with ZZT.  Chase has pretty much some of the best graphics I've seen. The cutscenes are drawn wonderfully. <br /><br />     The game play leaves a little to be desired, but in general the programming is good. The constant craving for blood adds to the rate at which you play the game. The drain of health, for the blood hunger, is slow enough to be toleralbe, but qucik enough to add excitement. The way you go about getting blood is probably what sets the mood so well. You go into these towns where people just stand around, and when people see you they run. They don't fight or call for help. Then you swoop down and tear them to shreads, sucking every last drop from their marrow. <br /><br />    Certainly the game has a very thick atmosphere. The dark cathedrals, the moist caves. The types of trees actually change based on climate. <br /><br />    The story, being turned into a vampire, seems not too original, but the inner turmoil (Yes I proclaimed not to like it in Burgler!, this is a different sort of game.) Makes the player feel awkward for the first few minuites about playing such a wierd character. But the way the races of the world are painted, you begin to enjoy, and near the end actually relish the idea that you're going to another town to devour people. <br /><br />    The midi music included makes the game very dark and shadowy. It's like watching Nosfaratu.<br /><br />    All in all, good fun."☃"1033321830"☃"blinespack.zip"☃"4"☃"68.112.246.23"
"Oh, bother."☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"There's a style of comedy that I call the Comedy of Escalation. In this type of joke, the audience is meant laugh as a situation grows more and more bizarre. An example would be the famous stateroom scene in the Marx Brothers' &quot;A Night at the Opera.&quot; At first, a few people occupy a small stateroom. Then cleaning staff come in. Then somebody comes to deliver a meal, and is caught inside with everybody else. Then somebody comes to fix a piece of furniture. And so on. The room, of course, becomes about as tightly packed as a sardine can, leading to an inevitable punchline.<br /><br />Nothing Constructive Part One is a hard game to review, because it's missing the punchline. It's cleverly written, with comic tension building as the PC manages to anger one interplanetary power after another, but there's no ending - just a cliffhanger. The story is neatly done, and the action between the cutscenes is well-planned and carefully executed, but the punchline never comes.<br /><br />This is to be expected, of course, as it was being saved for the sequel, but there is no sequel. NC Part Two was never released, and probably never will be, as Zanno left the community. What's left is a witty, fun game without an ending.<br /><br />Whether or not you can still enjoy the game depends, I guess, on whether you could read, say, the first two books of the Lord of the Rings and be contented to leave it at that.<br /><br />I, for one, will take what I can get. As long as it lasts, NC provides great fun.<br /><br />Pros: Good graphics, good programming, good storytelling, good gameplay.<br /><br />Cons: The cutscenes are told as infuriatingly sluggish little captions at the bottom of the screen, instead of quick-to-read text boxes. No NC Part Two."☃"1033344577"☃"nothing.zip"☃"5"☃"131.215.86.179"
"No, but seriously: are you guys smoking a crack?"☃"Funk"☃"Wilko_3000@yahoo.com"☃"Or even some pots?<br /><br />Nothing Constructive is not well written. It is not funny. The plot is not clever. Jesus, how low your standards must be to think that this is anyhting CLOSE to being a classic.<br /><br />Okay, let's take this from the top. Nothing Constructive could potentially have been a great game. However, Zanno has fudged up everything horribly. We being with a classic framing device - our heroes are being held at gunpoint, and the lead character (Zanno. I hate it when people put themselves in their games) flashes back to the start of the chain of events that lead to his current situation. This can be particularly effective, as it provides dual narrative tension - how did he get into this position, and will he be able to get out again?<br /><br />But Zanno over-eggs the mixture by having the voice-over constantly harp on about how X was the start of the last week of his life, or Y was the reason he was going to get killed blah blah blah. The framing device should be a tease; something to whet our appetites and fire out imaginations, not bore us to death with monologues of doom.<br /><br />But this is made worse by having the narrator tell us not only what happens in the long-term, but in the short-term too. We're told that Zanno is going to be sentenced to death three screens before it occurs, leaving the player staring at a cinema which tells him nothing he doesn't already know. Even the other characters do it - Steve apparently has a limited perception of the future, and repeatedly tells the player that there are baddies in the next room. No surprises. No tension. No reason to keep playing, except the blody-minded drive to complete the game. Someone needs to tie up Zanno and make him watch &quot;Fight Club&quot; until he &lt;i&gt;understands&lt;/i&gt;.<br /><br />The voiceovers, as I mentioned before, take up a large part of this game. In a movie this can add to the atmoshpere, with the narrator providing an ironic accompaniment to the action, and allowing the viewer to see exactly what his opinions on the current situation are. However, in Nothing Constructive it's used ALL THE FREAKING TIME. This wouldn't be so bad but it's usually just to hammer in another &quot;I'm going to die soon&quot; anvil.<br /><br />Now this crappy construction might not be so bad if the plot clever and original, but there's nothing new about a guy who has a package that everyone wants. Of course, all we've got here is the first part, but there's nothing here to warrant any praise. You get parcel. You get into loosely-connected episodic troubles, people chase you. There are hints that things may not be what they seem but frankly everyone's so boring it's hard to care.<br /><br />Which brings me onto another problem: characterisation. Zanno begins the game by murdering a guy he doesn't particularly like. Playing a sociopath might be fun, but midway through the game he's taking down robbers and getting pissy when they kill a bunch of hostages. Huh? Jesus, either the guy's a nut or he's not. Make up your mind.<br /><br />Aside from that, Zanno's character is paper-thin. He's not particularly funny, and seems to veer between being very dumb and very clever. But he's a fully rounded character compared to Steve, whose &quot;character&quot; is to stand around being smug. There's an attempt (or at least what I assume is an attempt) at rounding him out by having him bicker with a Communist man who joins your party, but their dialogue isn't sparky or funny enough to seem like anything more than a waste of your time. The rest of the characters are perfunctory and serve to rattle along the creaking plot.<br /><br />Speaking of the Communist, what IS Zanno's problem here? We're constantly told that Communism is BAD BAD BAD, and from the start Mr. Doom the Communist is shown as an EVIL NASTY GUY who wants to shoot you in the face. Now I'm assuming that this is building up to an incredible revelation where it turns out that the Communists are the true goodies and help you out. If not, then Zanno's got some kind of redneck-style Communist hatred issues to work out.<br /><br />Okay, I'm getting tired now so I'll list the rest of the stuff - the game uses dialogue at the bottom of the screen rather than in a text box, which is tooth-gnashingly slow. The bad guys are mostly boring to fight against. It features the world's worst RPG battle (and no, making a joke about how RPG battles suck does NOT excuse it). Ammo's usually in depserately short supply, and there's often not enough money to buy more. The game world makes no sense. The tertiary characters are stupid. The &quot;humour&quot; is tiresome and formulaic (and in places seemingly ripped off of other sources). The graphics are passable. The programming largely solid.<br /><br />Overrated."☃"1033604112"☃"nothing.zip"☃"1"☃"195.93.33.11"

As far as solid puzzle games go, this is definitely one of the top. The puzzles are difficult enough ensure that you don't beat it too easily, yet not so hard that you quickly become frustrated and stop playing.<br /><br />Gameplay: The puzzles are generally very solid. As in most games with intricate moving parts such as this, there is sometimes and occasional glitch that prevents you from continuing on as normal, but in most cases you must work hard to create such a glitch on purpose.<br /><br />Graphics: It's hard to apply a graphics rating in a puzzle game. A wide variety of colors are used on each board, causing your mind to &quot;wake up&quot; and become attentive for the puzzles. There isn't any necessarily attractive graphics, though that isn't a necessity for a puzzle game like this.<br /><br />Plot: The plot is minimal, as would be expected in an average puzzle game.

"Definitely a Classic"☃"KKairos"☃"kkairos@gmail.com"☃"Just to clarify a bit of background:<br />I didn't know exactly what would happen when I first made DGN. I did, then I then refined the engine (which became the DGN x2 / DGN Maximum engine) and put it up. People liked it. Just to note, DGN Tower 2.0 would have been the last DGN game made by me--Ultimate was WiL's spin on the x2 / Maximum engine.<br /><br />I thought I had the randomnity thing covered, then along comes WiL with Run-On and Run-On v2 and blows DGN outta the water. Run-On involves the player being chased by a dark force which, when it caught the player, was supposed to kill the player. The truly ingenious thing about Run-On was that it was randomly generated and it moved. The player had to be constantly on the move to avoid the darkness. I believe that the game was actually incomplete in terms of having a total, complete ending, but I don't believe it had so much to do with WiL's competence as with the limits of ZZT. The game gets progressively cooler as you go on, and <br />even has one section where you have to use torches. There are even one or two bosses. Anyone who wants an example of a very nice, well-thought out random game, this is one such example. Run-On is an awesome game."☃"1120972204"☃"run-on2.zip"☃"5"☃"207.200.116.197"

"Paid to kick @$$."☃"Zephyre Syx"☃☃"Ahh yes.  Chon nevered did disappoint me in none of his games and The Mercenary is not an exeption.  It's all because of his sence of taste.  He seems like a congenial person to hang around with.  Ehney weh, I manage to get this review done since I'm still computerless(grrr).<br /><br />_Game Play_<br /><br />Funfactor-If you like ArcadeSpeed, AdventureRPG.  Yewl lolve thos!  And it doesn't take long to complete. <br /><br />Features/Elements-The relic is the feature advertised in this game, as it is used in going places like many of the crap in the Zelda series(I had a similar idea from that).  But, unlike some game as,&quot;you gotta get this to go there&quot;, or anything that you got to get those idems respectively.  In this game, he has broke the bonds of liniar adventure and gives you the freedom to play your character...Oooh, but no story and no interacting people other than Chon and a bunch of merchants though.  Hmph, tuff.  Whatcha have is a choice of picking a Rope to go across gaps and lava pits, a Power Glove(see there) to move rocks, or a thief tool, or &quot;A Pick&quot; to unlock doors and junk.  Each choice will alter your path in your journey.  Juicy!!<br />   There are lots of well programmed OEs, such as the ones in the fire dungeon, and ice dungeon.  The favorite is the ??? that uses its power to make the candles shoot(never though of that).  The thing is that there are so many different ones that keeps your bloodlust going.  Incountering a new enemy and see what it takes to take'em out is always my thang roh huhl.  More I can say about other games,&quot;Wow...another damn bear.&quot;  There's also candy coated items you can collect.  Sweet!!<br /><br />Speed-Physically on my (brace yourself) PS/1 (ouch!), the game ran at half the normal speed.  I've found the problem.  Five BoardObjects on each board have no pauses.  It toke me 15min to go to every board and add /i under :loop.  That no problem with me and the game ran the way it should.  Now to the game itself.  You choose the relic you start and from there, you can immediately start playing.  I like that.`v'.  But you do have to run back and forward to buy shtuff and upgrade your weapons.  How fast you progress through the game depends on the person.  If you want to go on a hunt for blood, items, and cash, it might take you longer.  The dungeons are well lenght also and it won't take long to take out each dungeons masters.  The combat system is also speedy.  &quot;Chop, chop, kapow!! You gain 10XP&quot;.  Smoother than the bluntly stoping of many combating windows.  And of course, lack of story sequences that we are not going to get into in this section.<br /><br />_Atmosphere_<br /><br />Visual-You can tell graphic is not one of his feats as he uses the &quot;overly used&quot; fades.  One more time  &quot;_OVERLY USED_&quot; fades, as in it's just about everywhere.  I know that there are many other ways to make value that they need to be balanced.  The many color he uses on the dungeons keeps them from being boring and bland.  That's one thing I like about him.  The level design is always good.<br /><br />Sound/Music-The music kicks, but I can't help having a deja vu of the style of the music.  I like it.<br /><br />Imagetry-Auhh...There's no supporting text that gives the scription of the rooms you incounter.  These are the things that draws the player into the game by highthening the sences.  With little to no graphic, these powerful discription will saturate player with there own imagination like in books and literary work.  A DM like me knows this.  But remember the size of his file though...KABOOM!!!<br /><br />_Story_<br /><br />The name says it all.  You are hire to defeat the three dungeon master and take out the Ring Leader.  It might not answers why but thats as far as I can get from there.  Anyway, it hard to come up with a desent story and worry about the game.  Ain't like it would die without one.<br /><br />_Replay_<br /><br />Since you kick'd it's butt from left to right, let's do it vice versa.  The relics made it possible to break it from liniarity.  And cause of the speed, and changing gameplay, it came close of having no end.<br /><br />I'll say this again, I always had liked his games, and uhm...anymore of you players uses me as a waterhose or flippers can go jump. I hate freezing cold water. FIN"☃"1034695732"☃"merc.zip"☃"4"☃"204.29.66.36"

You have become very good, very fast.<br /><br />I am most impressed with the game's graphics. Quantum's simplistic, (though not minimalist) artwork makes &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; use of shading, and he has his own style for drawing people that I have never seen before in a ZZT game. And here's me, flogging Tsengism to death ...<br /><br />The engines are also very, very good. I enjoyed the flight deck ones in particular. The RPG battles are programmed seamlessly (even if they do look a little drab).<br /><br />I also noticed Quantum took the time to do some research before his game, naming his characters after astral bodies. This, my friend, is in my opinion one of the best warning signs of an upcoming brilliant ZZTer. <br /><br />However, what &lt;i&gt;OPERATION: Gamma Velorum&lt;/i&gt; is devoid of in terms of plot and narrative style and technique can only be partially compensated for by its impressive graphics and programming. The game is also, unfortunately, quite simply &lt;i&gt;boring&lt;/i&gt; in places.<br /><br />The lack of actual gameplay was not, in my opinion, that much of a problem. Had the genre of this game included the words 'Interactive Cinema' however, it would be slightly more accurate.<br /><br />I think three is rather harsh, but the perfection that would be denoted by a five would be unreasonable.

Also, just in the 3rd room of the first castle, I had to cheat, because there were just so many fields of enemies.  Plus, he scripted these stupid 'Tigers' that just shoot much much more(I actually believe he ripped the shooting script from someone else).

There are a few puzzles, secrets, and general fun innovations, but the bulk of the games is this: Shoot up big blocks of enemies before your health and ammo run out, then fight a stupid boss who appears to be related to Donkey Kong and who either shoots loads of bullets, throws loads of stars, or does both.  I was hoping for a boss who's interesting to fight, but instead I ended up pushing back walls of stars in an effort to hit the Kong with rapid-fire.  Not really all that fun.<br /><br />My other big disappointment was how little the game actually has to do with The Legend of Zelda.  Sure, it has Link, Ganon, and the Triforce thrown in as token references, but that's all.<br /><br />The graphics and board design are very nice, though.

"The original trippy game"☃"Zandor 12"☃"jtabor12@yahoo.com"☃"Merbotia seems to be a game that most people have forgotten about for some reason, which saddens me; it's a perfectly good game.  Considering when this game was made (1995, I think), the audio/visual was great, and this is one of the first games to have a nonsensical plot without sucking horribly.<br /><br />Anyway, you wake up one day and have to save the world from some horrible monster or other.  You do so, but then there's this space station...  okay, so I haven't played the game in awhile and my mind has fogged over some of the finer details.  Bleagh.<br /><br />The game consists mostly of old-school style shooting at stuff, only the graphics don't look like pig vomit due to through STK-use and decent drawing skills on Sonic 256's part.  There's also some decent music- a forgettable theme song, and a rendition of music from the first Super Mario Bros- I think it's from the first underground stage. <br /><br />GAMEPLAY: Shooting, shooting, and more of it, but the game knows to cut it off just as it's starting to get old; for example, a good ways into the space station there is an interactive conversation that has several possible outcomes including death and an alternate ending. There's a good overall balance between plot, shooting, and weird humor, a fairly rare thing.<br /><br />The shooting does get somewhat repetitive at times, and the game's on the shortish side with not too much replay value, but all in all Merbotia is a forgotten classic worth downloading.

"Good game Lord395...keep imrpoving, though"☃"KKairos"☃"notgiven@no.com"☃"When I first started this game, I heard the Star Wars theme. Appropriate, as this is a Star Wars game (hopefully, Lord395 wrote it himself). The game's storyline is the same basic thing as Star Wars. You begin as an untrained Jedi, and must train, then go on a mission to destroy the Death Star. That's the basics, and the plot does have its own little parts. It's not Rhygar, but it's not Mario Bros. either.<br /><br />Probably the biggest drawback to this game was the usage of pre-fab enemies. Lions, tigers, and ruffians permeated the game. Just so ya know, though, that's better than no enemies at all. The troopers could have been made better if they had walked and shot at you instead of standing still.<br />The other thing that was bad about the game was the graphics. They were, at least, STK-level at points, but were mostly more mediocre...But this guy had the common sense not to use yellow walls.<br /><br />The best thing about this game was Lord395's attention to detail. There were areas like the Jedi Lounge where you could go that weren't mandatory, and at least one thing you could do to boost your health that wasn't mandatory. There were just a few side-things (not sidequests, side-things) some of which distracted from the game but most of which helped the game in my opinion.<br /><br />All in all, Lord395, good game, but needs some improvement. If you could maybe work a bit more on graphics and enemies (which affected the gameplay, I'll bet), along with the story, this game could reach a four in my book.<br /><br />Download if you'd like a trip to the Star Wars universe that's a bit different and can handle a few minor flaws."☃"1035654936"☃"search.zip"☃"3"☃"198.81.27.11"

"Simply a Fun Game"☃"Benco"☃"ZukiGamagachi@hotmail.com"☃"BQ is, hands down, my favorite ZZT game I've ever played.  What is the reason for this you may ask?  Let me take you on a wonderful boat ride.<br /><br />Firstly, the game is simple.  You are given a simple task of collecting bananas.  No complicated plot to follow, no twists, no lofty goals, just banana retrieving.  The idea of item collection works for almost all platformers and it works just as fine here.<br /><br />Secondly, the programming in this game is amazing.  He really pulled some awesome stunts here with the different engines and stuff.  WiL knows what he's doing with zzt-oop and does it creativly.  However, it uses a different zzt-oop so it might not be the best game to dissect apart and learn from.  The altered exe is also a different touch and gives the game a little more of a &quot;stand alone&quot; feel.<br /><br />Thirdly, and this is just iceing on the cake, is the graphics.  Amazing, really really well done here.  Along with the sound and everything else, it creates a game that FEELS like banana quest.  Very good work here.  However,some of the engineshad a few sour graphics, but that could hardly be avoided.<br /><br />The game isn't perfect however.

It turned out to be 'The Search For The Magic Flamingo'.<br />I thought to myself - it's got a silly name so the plot's bound to be poor after about three boards.<br />In actual fact there wasn't really much plot, but the obvious (find afore mensioned flamingo).  However it was enough to get me to play the whole thing.<br />There is little or no music, which I think is a good thing.  Too many games use less than good music which only really serves to piss the player off after a couple of goes.  It does however make those pleasing blips and arpedgio things when you pick stuff up, or do something good.<br />There was a good selection of boards, although most of them tended to be simply shoot the creatures and touch the stuff.  Despite this the uniformity of level style made it flow well.<br />The puzzles in the game were far too easy, especially the boulder push (see level eight for an example).<br />Overall the game was very playable and quite satisfying to play."☃"1036086917"☃"magicflamingo.zip"☃"4"☃"131.111.8.97"

"Fun, but needs more polish for a &quot;Silver Edit"☃"Ryan Ferneau"☃"rferneau@iastate.edu"☃"It's a nice attempt at transfering the greatness of the show to a game.  The author probably messed up a couple of story concepts, but that's not what detracts from the game.<br /><br />The general flow of the story is well-conceived.  The first file has an intro level, then challenges the player to find ten golden keys to finish the game and continue to the second file.  (Though for some reason I ended up with an extra key...?)  The coolest part of the deal is that the player gets to choose where to go next.  Some levels can be beaten at any time (sidequests), while others go in a certain order (main quest).  The scoring system is neat, and the help board explains it pretty well.  The second file is a couple of really hard puzzles and a couple of really hard boss battles that finish off the story.  Overall, the game did a good job of mixing various gaming genres into a coherent story.<br /><br />The downside is that the game is really easy to glitch up sometimes, especially on Rytop and Zeta-B7.  The author ought to do some more heavy testing to foolproof the puzzles so they make a bit more sense.  (And if you're trying to block off the player from the passage he/she just entered, DON'T SURROUND IT WITH FAKES AND TRY TO CHANGE THEM TO NORMALS LATER!  If anything, surround the passage with one-way teleporters, then delete them when it's time to leave.)  The other bad thing about the game is that most of its boards look rather ugly.  Mostly it's just the old newbie &quot;gotta fill up the board&quot; syndrome that Tim Sweeney's first three games tended to have, plus the tacky force fields made out of water that change to forest."☃"1036480158"☃"drwho1.zip"☃"4"☃"64.113.91.12"
"A more reasoned review"☃"TTTPPP"☃☃"The game is indeed a text adventure, and so maybe ZZT was the wrong format to release it in.<br />However it does have only 1 board, and takes about 10 mins to complete, so by playing it you don't really lose anything.  The writing is at times very humourous, with interesting views on real life things (eg. Screwball-Scramball).<br />The main problem I have with this game is that the plot is thin / non-existant.  I start off in a cave, and get told I have no brains but like buns.  This fact comes up I think twice in the game, as I jump randomly from my cave to Italy to America, etc.<br />I think that by combining the ideas in this game, and some of the humour, with an engine (like '4' by jojoisjo has) a very good text adventure game could be made.

"Guaranteed 100% intro-free"☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"Plot:<br /><br />There is a disease of ZZT designers that I like to call... Terminal Introsis. The most common symptom is the placement of a huge knot of exposition in the introduction of a game. When this happens, it is extremely likely that the writing in the remainder of the game will be minimal. The general effect of this is that it becomes clear that the author wanted to get the plotline out of the way early.<br /><br />Rogue Three not only dodges this problem, but completely reverses it. Rather than give the player central information at the beginning of the game, Bitman does something unprecedented.<br /><br />He creates suspense, and gives out the answers at the END of the game! At last, a ZZT writer has figured out why mystery and suspense novels sell so well.<br /><br />The discovery of the nature of the gameworld is left up to the player. Clues are dropped left and right, but complete explanation is saved for the game's ending, which ties up the plot threads and neatly explains the setting of the game for those who missed the clues.<br /><br />The ending itself is a mixed bag. To those who don't see it coming, it should seem an extremely clever plot twist. To those who DO see it coming, it will probably seem anticlimactic. It's still neatly done, though.<br /><br />Graphics:<br /><br />A mixed bag. But I don't really care.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />Although Bitman flirts with nonlinearity and multiple scenarios, and has some very clever timer effects, there are several areas of weakness in the gameplay.<br /><br />The most noteworthy puzzle of the game is a clever slider puzzle that requires considerable forethought. It is surprisingly good, and brings a bit of life to the tired formula, but it's still a slider puzzle. Some might object, I suppose.<br /><br />The other sticking point in the gameplay is an &quot;underground cavern&quot; sequence of darkened rooms, monsters, and, if you are unlucky enough to be thrown onto one particular plot thread, insufficient ammo. The sequence isn't long, but it's completely unnecessary.<br /><br />The third, and greatest, weakness of the gameplay is the large ratio of walking to actual playing. There are some very nice landscapes, but they are often essentially empty of noteworthy objects.<br /><br />On the bright side, the cutscenes and dialogues are in text box form, and can thus be read quickly, without the ridiculous &quot;one line every ten seconds&quot; format that results when an author decides to use the bottom-of-the-screen marquee text approach.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />A very nice game, with a creative plotline. It has its weak spots but, at its best, it reminds me vaguely of Isaac Asimov's &quot;Nightfall.&quot;"☃"1036546110"☃"rogue.zip"☃"4"☃"131.215.90.232"

I like Viovis games for their admirable graphics, insane creativity, and, well, the incoherent nonsense.  But in this game, Viovis has made the incoherent nonsense TOO incoherent and TOO nonsensical.

For his sake I certainly hope so.<br /><br />The game is also far too long.  The reason that The Motivational Speaker worked was because all the individual parts told a story, weird as it was, and the reason Pool Table worked was because, despite its utter randomness, it was short enough that it didn't give you a chance to become bored.  PPDV however, suffers from being much longer than TMS and much more random than Pool Table, without providing the entertainment of either.<br /><br />Altogether horrible.

"Spiffy."☃"Zandor 12"☃"jtabor12@yahoo.com"☃"I want to give this game a 3.5, dammit.  Anyway, this is a rather novel concept, bringing a text adventure into ZZT format, although it feels more like a Choose Your Own Adventure Book, and much easier, too- most of the time, when you screw up, you're given an option to undo and try the other route, making it nearly impossible to die.  But even despite this, the game has just enough branchiness to make it good for two or three playthroughs.<br /><br />The humor is a good hybrid of stupid/random/trippy, and holds up long enough for you to see everything without getting tired of the jokes.  They wear thin eventually, though.<br /><br />As it is, this game, although not a classic by any means, is quite amusing and worth a download.  Play through it a few times, have fun, then forget it.

Within each is some sort of general stupidity for you to sort out, usually culminating in some kind of huge, well-programmed boss battle.  The mission-based gameplay is well-thought out and can be replayed repeatedly without growing old; in fact, in the Blue's Clues area there are three ways to accomplish your mission of killing Blue and blowing up his house.<br /><br />The graphics are pretty good, and there's a good font that makes them better.<br /><br />Everything in the game oozes with weird humor and plot, and the whole thing is pretty long, at least by ZZT standards- it takes somewhere from 2-4 hours to beat.<br /><br />You must download this game and play it now.

"Oddly amusing."☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"The cameos of A Community X-Mas are inaccurate. In fact, the game's writers specifically state this at the game's opening. And so, an obvious question arises:<br /><br />Why make a cameo game with inaccurate cameos? Doesn't that miss the point?<br /><br />This becomes even more of a problem due to the nature of ACX-M's gameplay. Much of gameo consists of walking around and talking to the cameo objects. There's a mystery plotline tying everything together, and a refreshingly different endgame, but the majority of the game still consists of wandering around talking to people whose names you recognize. When the names don't match the personalities, the game naturally feels flat.<br /><br />This is a puzzle to me. Why take an excellent premise (&quot;ZZTers are trapped in a palatial chalet in the snow, and begin disappearing one by one. Whodunit?&quot;) and then rob it of its charm by leaving out the one thing that would make it really compelling: the personalities? Why throw away the chance to make people actually interested in finding out whether or not their persona is the villain? There's an astounding amount of wasted opportunity here.<br /><br />On the other hand, ACX-M would be a decent ZZT game even if all the recognizable names were discarded. There are some amusing bits, the whole game is very nicely illustrated, and the Rube Goldberg sequence in the endgame is particularly clever.<br /><br />Summary: Forget trying to associate the characters with their online personas, and just act as if ACX-M didn't contain anybody you knew. In those circumstances, it's actually pretty entertaining."☃"1038134645"☃"comxmas.zip"☃"4"☃"131.215.90.102"

"And now I would like to present &quot;Hamlet ZZT&q"☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"Well, I'm not exactly certain what to say about this game. It's brilliantly hilarious, but that's because it pulls all of its dialogue from the brilliantly hilarious novel upon which it is based. On the other hand, it isn't exactly an act of plagiarism, as Nanobot credits Douglas Adams with the dialogue...<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />I suppose the most fitting genre for this demo would be &quot;semi-interactive tribute.&quot; It's mostly composed of cutscenes, with the exception of one well-executed interactive sequence that nicely captures the atmosphere of the novel's opening.<br /><br />Graphics:<br /><br />Varied. The cutscene graphics are nice, and I really liked the title screen, but the scene in Arthur Dent's house was a bit bland.<br /><br />Writing:<br />Brilliant, as I mentioned. Also in violation of copyright laws, but what can you do? Nanobot trimmed and edited some of the funnier passages from the book and used them for the game's dialogue, and the effect is generally a positive one. However, some of his transitions are careless, and his mixing of quotations sometimes results in abrupt shifts in tense.<br /><br />Oh, and it won't be QUITE as funny if you've read all the jokes before.<br /><br />Final Verdict:<br /><br />This could be a good game if the cutscenes were minimized and replaced with more gameplay. Actually stomping around the house as Arthur Dent [1] has its charms, and exploring the Heart of Gold in the full version could be extremely fun. However, the editing of Adams' work needs to be more careful, and the quoting less extensive.<br /><br />[1] The comic timing of this segment is thrown off somewhat by the interactive nature of the sequence, but it's still not bad.

"Evan Darrow games..."☃"krzhang"☃"krzhang@cox.net"☃"From what I remember, Evan Darrow was a designer back in the days of 1992-1995ish times, when ZZT was really active on AOL (sadly, the service for ZZTers has all but disappeared). Evan Darrow wanted to charge for many of his games, but the games were very amatuerish, usually resulting in no plot, and gigantic meshes of battles with premade monsters and slightly-programmed objects. I really don't suggest that any of Darrow's games are worth looking at, even though they were done at such an early age. An example of a game of much better quality but was done at the same time is Link's Adventure Trilogy, and although that game will not be ranked highly now (post-STK era), the game was definitely a classic of the time.

"Lost Gem?"☃"krzhang"☃"krzhang@cox.net"☃"Hey, its my first review. I've been playing ZZT since like 1993, but haven't made anything since then so probably nobody knows me. (I code in C). But since I have played a lot of games, I guess I'll offer a few reviews, this being the first.<br /><br />I always thought Fury Spell was a very impressive title, which is disappointing, given that I never really saw it given a great review, and found it lying on some random website. However...<br /><br />Get the bad things out of the way. The plot has nothing too special here. &quot;Evil Wizard killed your master and you must avenge him&quot; or something, though I must say that the ending is very interesting. In the music department, I don't think there was anything spectacular. Some tunes were fine though.<br /><br />The graphics were really good for its age, I think. The RPG graphics were well-designed and the shading showed adequate experience in ZZT graphics. The subtle animations were dutifully worked on.<br /><br />Gameplay... I think this game really shines here. I like the concept of collecting spells from different sources and using them in RPG-battles everywhere. RPG Battles have now become commonplace, ever since probably 1999, but the Fury Spell works it out fine. My only complaint was that the last battle was ANNOYINGLY annoying to win.<br /><br />I really thought this was a good game. Recommended.<br /><br />-Yan"☃"1038756236"☃"fury.zip"☃"4"☃"64.121.6.19"
"Testa-style"☃"krzhang"☃"krzhang@cox.net"☃"It seems to be very Anthony Testa-influenced (Dungeon Master's Gallery?) well, sory if I am wrong. But coolzx did a good job with a dungeon crawl. I love this type of game, and its very well done.<br /><br />The plot is sorta cliched, but still very interesting with its twists. The graphics were well-done, including a very nicely thought-out theme screen that you see after playing a few boards. There were few musical additions, but those that existed were good enough.<br /><br />The fighting system is balanced, I must think A great difficulty with designing RPGs, roguelikes, or ZZT games which simulate them is probably how to make the game not too hard in the beginning or not too easy to the end. Coolzx seemed to have playtested it enough to make it challenging yet not overboard throughout hte whole game. The final battle is very satisfying, and the idea of conserving limited resources is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks! A nice title indeed.<br /><br />-Yan"☃"1038756537"☃"admd.zip"☃"5"☃"64.121.6.19"

Unfortunately, he hasn't a clue of who that is, so he just goes around challenging random people to dance competitions until he finds the right one through dumb idiot luck.<br /><br />The graphics are simple but well done, and the game has a thoroughly trippy atmosphere (The title has nothing to do with anything).  As for gameplay, well, the 'dancing' consists of shooting at pre-fab enemies until you get so many points, while the game yells random messages at you such as 'DID YOU EAT YOUR BREAKFAST???????' and whatnot.  As you progress through the 3 levels, there are more enemies and they come at you faster.  No need to worry, though- you're given far more health and ammo than you actually need, and you can always just hide in a corner if things get too rough.<br /><br />This game, despite its incredibly short length and utter lack of anything in the way of challenge or replay value, is worth playing, if mostly for the weirdness of it all.

"Good attempt... bad finish. Play the Puzzles..."☃"krzhang"☃"krzhang@cox.net"☃"I think for the time it was released this had good enough graphics to do what it wanted to do. The premise is interesting too.<br /><br />Plot: nonexistent, but it doesn't hurt. The game is clearly just a mix of three different types (puzzle, adventure, and RPG), and you have to finish all three.<br /><br />RPG: I did this first. I believe RPG battles have been standard for a while when this game came out, so it wasn't all that spetacular. The carrying damage system was interesting (at least for me). It wasn't really an &quot;RPG&quot; because there was no plot. You had to defeat about six baddies in increasing order. I like the fact that youcould buy many spells and equipment, and learn techniques, but the lack of anything except battles made it a little disappointing.<br /><br />Puzzle: I love small puzzles, and I was delighted by their inclusion in Triad. I believe this is where the game shines, and is worth a download by a puzzle fan. I think Mastermind was done perfectly, and the ricoshet puzzle was nice too. A few other puzzles were too easy, but it was an enjoyable thing for a coffee break.<br /><br />Adventure: I really didn't like this. There were quite a few places where no care was given (dead objects #DIE instead of blending in with carpet, and it was only 4 boards of basically getting objects from A to B.

"i hate this game and i hate you too"☃"Nadir"☃"nadir427@hotmail.com"☃"If Tseng games were ice cream, Gem Hunter SE would be Rocky Road, Mega Job would be Mint Choc Chip, and November Eve would be Brandy and Butterscotch; a good idea in theory, but in practice overrated and just a little crap.<br /><br />The plot leads on from Gem Hunter 2; following Kim's kidnapping by Aric on planet Seegeeb and Gem Hunter's saving of her from rabid dobermans, the two head to the Da Hood capital (whose name I forget), and make a visitation to an opera. Towards the end of the torturous performance, however, one of the actors begins acting (duh) strangely; before action can be taken, the entire audience spontaneously combusts, eith the exception of Kim. Gem Hunter survives being burnt horribly, and is taken to hospital while Kim goes after the killer; only to find he is possessed by an evil spirit or something called Steve who is making the xamboxumbadria of the Da Hood citizens (similar to earth's mitochondria) overcharge and explode. Being from Earth, Kim is not in possession of this organelle perculiar to Da Hood, and is therefore the only person able to approach Steve. With the help of Tyrone and the Boys in Blue, she tries to stop Steve before he blows up the entire city. The plot's a rip of Parasite Eve, and I like it.<br /><br />So I like the plot. So why 2/5? Instead of writing a whole lot of crap I'll condense my scathing into a few bullet points;<br /><br />* annoying RPG battle engine which is too slow to manouvere, mildly confusing and requires no real stategy beyond &quot;dodge the bullets&quot;<br />* horribly tedious &quot;flashing line at bottom of screen&quot; cinemas with borderline retarded dialogue<br />* inverted shading ruins the otherwise neat graphics<br />* too damn many of the aforementioned horribly tedious cinemas<br />* irritating, repetitive title screen and cinema music (courtesy of Kev Carter, who usually wrote much better (except the stuff in Freedom, of course))<br /><br />Having said that, there's a few nice touches. Having all the cameos in the game explode horribly was neat, as was the effect of having Flatcoat Lab explode and 'turn into' a dark grey charred corpse was neat. The idea of having a third, locked file with a proper ending also adds to the gameplay, and the third file is admittedly engaging, having mini-games and a battle with craNKGod. But the game is less than the sum of these parts.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like Tseng games for the most part; I just find this one severely lacking. But hey, it's better than Welcome to Hell, which in terms of ice cream is that horrible Rum and Raisin flavour. =(<br /><br />My advice here is to skip the game and just play the third file!<br /><br />&lt;font size=1&gt;* all opinions on ice cream are subjective to Nadir"☃"1039612035"☃"november.zip"☃"2"☃"138.253.119.100"

This one, is different.<br /><br />The title screen was something that kinda looked like the q3 logo. I thought, &quot;Hey. Maybe this won't be so bad after all!&quot; Oh boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />First of all, this author didn't put ANY SPACES after punctuation. That is something you all need to learn, kids. I mean,when you have something that looks like this, it gets kinda annoying!Get what I'm saying?Anyhow, let's move on.<br /><br />The menu screen isn't really a menu at all, it's more like a choose a passage with labels. Ok, I picked arena.<br /><br />Cool. There was a 'boot camp' level! I go into that passage first. There are some instuctions implanted DIRECTLY on the board itself, which basically say; Shoot the dummies.<br />Dodge the bullets and hit the X.<br />Climb the wall and kill the enemies.<br />Touch the O.<br />This seems simple enough. But then I looked at the board. It's another one of those &quot;SIDESCROLLER EMULATION&quot; boards, where they just put black walls above the player and made it in a 2-D mario aspect. BUNK. I blast through this boot camp mission, and when I touch the O, it says something along the lines of this: &quot;ok,ok,i made this board for no reason,and it was dumb&quot;<br /><br />#ENDGAME. Oh man, I got pissed. So I loaded up the game and this time, instead of going to boot camp, I went to &quot;Palace&quot;. Some little green dude was running around randomly shooting bullets in a small arena. I killed him instantly. Every now and then, he would taunt me with sayins like &quot;I own you boy&quot; And &quot;ohno,back to boot camp 4 me!&quot; After I completely destroyed him, nothing happened. I remembered something on the menu screen about ?+Q, and when I did that, it says &quot;You have left the arena!!!&quot;<br /><br />That's when I decided to take the biggest hook I could find, shove it in my left eye socket and impale myself with the rustiest nail I could find.<br /><br />Graphics: 2<br />Sound: 0<br />Gameplay: 1<br />Controls: 0<br />Fun Factor: 1"☃"1039813428"☃"Quakearena.zip"☃"1"☃"64.154.186.75"

"Well, I like it. In that funny-feeling-in-my-loins"☃"Commodore"☃"Jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"    Rebirth is all in all a good ZZT game. Compared to recent releases, it's great. But, in the long run only good. <br /><br />The first thing that struck me about the game was it's music. It started to sound like it was very good. And it is, sometimes. The music seems to have no direction and takes wierd turns. But it is used properly and is never tedious. The music is used not just to add depth to a scene, but to add an atmosphere, and that's the most you can ask.<br /><br />The graphics are spot on. Good shading and drawing on buildings andsuch. The forests are a little lack lustre, but I really enjoyed the caves. They even had stagmites. Sadly there were very few art boards. <br /><br />So the graphics were good and the music was good. What went wrong?<br /><br />Well, it was partly the gameplay. It might've been easier for those young'uns out there who can remember every Tekken move on the face of the planet (i think there are 2 million?) but it just either didn't translate well into ZZT or i'm just dyslexic. I was able to kill, but mainly avoid, my enemies, but it just didn't lend itself to aiding the rest of the game. The concept is great, don't get me wrong, but having to do diffenrt co-ordinated moves while surrounded on all sides by monsters was confusing. Plus I was never really clear as to what event lead to you using your powers. Probably just missed that though. <br /><br />The buggy battle system might've been masked as better than it was if you didn't have so many chances to experiment with it. You need to fight, or in my case avoid (another flaw, you could get through a lot of the game with little challange.) a lot of monsters in a lot of areas. This lent to frustration as a dying player could not properly execute his moves whilst surrounded my ten monsters. Well, for this sort of battle system, I would've prefered less monsters with more skill, that way you can have a nice 1 on 2, 1 on 3 battle with creatures that knew their way around the ring making battle a little more interesting.<br /><br />Next we have the story. Now in this day we are coming short on good RPG stories because all of the easy ones are taken. So it's fair to say that the story is a good spin on some things that have been done before. It's not bad, I enjoy familiarity, total originallity is reallt hard. Look at my games, a zombie game and  on based on Wolfestein. But I digress from the topic. <br /><br />Rebirth, The Uprising is a good game, it really is. There are just a few snags keeping it from being a great one. <br /><br /> "☃"1040367202"☃"rebirthfix.ZIP"☃"4"☃"68.112.246.23"
"Anybody remember Ultima: Ascension?"☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"I never played Ultima: Ascension, but I remember what the Computer Gaming World review said; U: A is a game with wonderful potential crippled by amazing bugginess.<br /><br />Rebirth is the ZZT equivalent of U: A. <br /><br />Writing:<br /><br />Rebirth features a nice attempt at an epic plotline, with the obligatory battle between Science and Magic, but glaring flaws in the writing undermine it. The pacing is good, but the characterization is so-so. The plotline is above average, but the grammar and spelling are often downright painful. In short, the writing is a mixed bag.<br /><br />Graphics:<br /><br />Nice. Can't fault the graphics, really.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />The use of a combo system adds vitality to what has become an otherwise stale combat system (walk up to creatures, touch, back off, repeat), and shows immense promise. However, this gimmick, which is also applied pretty well to some puzzles, isn't quite exploited as well as it could be. Also, as ZZT has a bit of a reaction time problem, the controls are more than a little finicky.<br /><br />The non-combat gameplay, however, is marred by horrendous bugs. Even in the ostensibly fixed version, I ran into a fatal passage error. Attempting to fix the problem, I found that the file's boards were ordered in a confusing enough manner that I ended up viewing most of the remaining game before I corrected the problem. This is not good.<br /><br />In addition to the killer passage, there were several points at which objects sent messages that were, for some reason, either never received or just misinterpreted. &quot;BAD COMMAND&quot; errors even popped up now and then, which is certainly NOT a good thing.<br /><br />Several objects referred to one of the characters by the name of another, and the game used two different spellings of the villain's name. This is not something one gets in a polished, FINISHED game.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />An ambitious example of why thorough beta testing is crucial to a game's playability."☃"1040404694"☃"rebirthfix.ZIP"☃"3"☃"209.179.141.139"

"Mom would be proud."☃"Commodore"☃"Jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"Ezanya is a really good game. The problems are minor yet very detracting to the gameplay. There are some programming errors, especially with the potions. Also the game is rather hard. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but the ammo/monster ratio is really badly slanted towards the monster side. This is especially evident in the earlier stages of the game. But what sets this game above others made in 1991? Well I'd have to say a lot. The story for one is not the tedious: &quot;get the 5 magical(oo!) purple keys&quot;. And while the story may seem typical in the beginging (Get the septre, crown, etc) it definetly has a great twist. On top of that, the writing is top notch with detailed descriptions and some really nice imagery. The game is very diffucult to beat though and I did have to cheat in some parts where health was really running thin. A position that presented itself a few too many times was having 10-20 health and having to back track through walls of spinning guns.

The graphics are noting special but not totally god awful. The programmer captures mountains and forests nicly without stk. Again credit due for this.

This game was so good that when Zenith made a SE, he only had to change the graphics. The only pre-programmed monsters in the entire game was a set of centipedes at the begining. From begining to end this game drips of originality. The story is bizzare and funny. Treking through a monster/robot is engaging and it's neat to see all the different parts of the body. The puzzles incoperate flags accross many different boards; while a standard now, it certainly was not in 1991. Then when you think the game will sucumb to the archetypes of 1991 standards and you just know that the last boss will be shooting in four directions and throwing an ungodly amount of stars, he doesn't. And instead you playfully chase him around the room until you catch him. The graphics were great and sometimes very humourous. There is little that makes this game weak, except for perhaps the deep throat boards and the mazes. But even the maze was interesting. And the deep throat boards were the earliest of this type i've seen. My advice, PLAY THIS GAME. You won't regret it."☃"1040757852"☃"Smiley.zip"☃"4"☃"68.112.246.23"
"Yo ho ho and a bottle of fun"☃"Commodore"☃"JDDGames@Yahoo.com"☃"Deceiving Guidance is a very impressive and fun game. It really go out on a limb to create something both original and fun for the player, and it succeeds. Because this is a very complex game, I will attempt to devide everything into sections, yet somethings will bleed over.<br /><br />Story: From the begining I thought the story was good. I was pleasently suprised when by the end of the game it got even better. The tribulations between the mysterious Dark elves (The drow) and the light elves of the overworld, made for a wonderful contrast in moods as the game progressed from the nice village to the wild forest, to the cave, to the drow lair. There was plenty of history provided along with details of cultural differances. There was a nice twist and a good ending that did leave me feeling that there should be a sequal. My onlt qualm with the story, which is more of the writer's choice, was the fact that it didn't seem epic. Even though it only happened in an area maybe 2 miles wide it still could've captured more of a scope. Look at Diablo, it only takes place underneath one town! <br /><br />Graphics: In standard IF style the graphics were well polished and added very much to the overall feel of the game. The first file was the most impressive with lovely cottages and well drawn forest scene. I've seen better caves, but in general the proper atmosphere was set and the gradual transformation from cave to lair was a very mood setting effect. The cutscenes at the end of the game were what really set the second file apart from the first and the last board was a great capstone to the entire game. <br /><br />Gameplay: Nothing spectacular here. The standard run up and touch a creature to death. Something I'm not to good at and I had to play the game a few times to survive till the end. It was good challange but in the end my tactic was to avoid as much as possible, making for a game without gameplay. Had battle been a little less of a hassle, then there would be more fun. (YAY another thing to kill!) There was little exploration in the forest, yet the caves made up for it which in this case was a bad thing. I expected that the caves would be built around the same semi-linear fashion as the forest. Yes this is somewhat a bad call on me, but once again I had to play  through a few times. This time the reason was not dying, although I did my fair share of that, it was lack of torches. I had to play through a few times finding out where everything was before loading it back up and running through doing what I had to do before the life-sustaining light ran out. In the caves another gameplay change is the addition of a &quot;gun&quot; actually its magic but you get the ability to now shoot at yuor enemies. I'm torn on this one. It seemed the proper thing to do, but also it seemed like the programmer(s) were making it easier for you. In the caves, you could no longer avoid your enemies as well as you could before. This makes me wonder if even the programmers technique in the forest was avoiding enemies. Not a good sign. <br /><br />Music: Better than what I can do, I'm jealous. Used perfectly.<br /><br />The Puzzle: Well, this thing haunted me for nights after playing it. Usually in slider puzzles you know what order they are supposed to go in, in this puzzle you need to figure it out. I think I must've missed something early in the game that would have helped me with what it was supposed to read because this thing took me as long to beat as the rest of the game. Clever and a good piece of programming, but it could be a game unto itslef and SEVERLY ruins the pace and mood the entire first file was attempting to create. <br /><br />Overall: One of the best games ZZT has ever seen. It could be better(Gameplay!), but I can't argue with the high calibre story and sensational graphics. Two thumbs up, but only a 4.5. "☃"1040915856"☃"decguide.zip"☃"4.5"☃"68.112.246.23"
"Good game"☃"WildWeasel"☃"wildweasel_lemon@hotmail.com"☃"Being a fan of Squaresoft RPG's in general (Parasite Eve in particular), I naturally had to grab this game. Essentially a parody of the Parasite Eve game, it's handled quite well, from the RPG battles to the cinema sequences that are almost the same as the originals (I dont count the dialog in the similarity).<br /><br />The game starts with Gem Hunter and Kim playing a game of 5-card stud poker. They had taken a bet: if Kim wins, she gets to drag Gem Hunter wherever she would like to for the night. Kim wins, and she takes Gemmy (&quot;I TOLD you to quite callimg me Gemmy!!&quot;) to an opera at Migraine Hall.<br /><br />It all stays the same; just incredibly boring, until the people start setting fire. One of the actors is possessed by Steve, who has control of the Xamboxumbadria in all beings. And so, Kim must stop Steve.<br /><br />The battles are handled quite well, with te ability to attack your enemy, use special attacks, or heal yourself. It's a lot more involved than most other ZZT RPGs, all because of the variety in ways you can attack (instead of &quot;ATTACK&quot; and &quot;DEFEND&quot;). While waiting for your AT gauge to charge, you must dodge the attacks of the enemy. Its usually more fun if you set the ZZT game speed up by 3 notches. Add to that, you have 3 equippable weapons, and the ability to find new items and November Energy abilities to use on enemies (or yourself).<br /><br />The cinema sequences, which are used to advance the story A LOT, are handled like most other ZZT games. It takes a while to see where all the characters are, and what they're doing. The dialog is entirely done using message row text (and since this isnt MZX, its flashing, but I can deal with it). The only thing preventing me from ?ZAP-ing my way to the next board was the funny dialog, courtesy of Tseng.<br /><br />It's amazing that such a game can be done so well in ZZT, so I give Tseng's effort 4.5/5.<br /><br />IN REVIEW:<br />HIGHS - Good graphics in most parts, funny dialog, RPG battles handled well for the most part<br />LOWS - Cinemas can get boring.<br />BOTTOM LINE - A good ZZT RPG, for those looking for something to rid them of the awful taste left by &quot;Final Fantasy 2&quot;, or those who just have to have every RPG on z2."☃"1040946988"☃"november.zip"☃"4.5"☃"68.64.0.20"

Well, sort of.<br /><br />The most outstanding feature of Asbestos was Vampy's trademark adventure format, as seen in ZT.  You will learn to manipulate your items in unheard of ways.  You will learn.<br /><br />The battles use the same engine you may have seen in sim #dd version 2.0.  Fairly original and yet serviceable, the RPG battle engine will suit your ass-kicking needs.<br /><br />The non-linearity adds a nice feel.  I particularly enjoyed sneaking around the museum like Solid Snake.

The good sides of the game is gameplay and music. The gameplay of course is RPG. You run around talking to people and doing some giving &amp; taking. It may sound boring, but it gets better later on. The music however, is mellow and sometimes hard sounding. Sometimes, it is even better if it had no music, but the music is great and thats the story!<br /><br />Oh speaking of story, here are the downsides: Cinematic, Sound, Graphics.<br />The cinematics take you the whole time to view and they make you want to zap the box to get on with the game. Herc should of made a seperate cinematics board in the main menu. The sound is sometimes a little squeaky when you touch signs etc. The sound should have not been high pitched. It is better low pitched. The graphics, however, are badly pixilized. This may not sound bad, but sometimes you cant see where you are going. My tip, just make your outside worlds less pixilized. You can pixilize your worlds, just dont put too much complexity on!<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of IF games (like me) go on and download.

The story is nice and I really enjoyed that aspect of it. But battles were tedious and not difficult to beat at all. The programmer gave you too much life and magic, and gave it to you a lot. Also there was very little strategy to the battles which featured many spells, the majority of which you didn't use or even know what they did. Battles also jumped on you when you went into doors, which was confusing. The graphics were really nice though and all captured the mood of the game well.

"Dead Moon Demo by Starbux"☃"nuero"☃"nuarrow@yahoo.com"☃"Dead Moon was the last release from starbux. Starbux wasn't one to release much; searching by his nickname on z2 comes up with four matches. One is his first game, a breakout hit, Erectile Dysfunction. While this game was short, he was only getting started.<br /><br />Another was the 24hozzt we made together, titled 'The Prophecy'. He redid a bit from the one we sent in and that was our release. Again, this does nothing to show the skill of starbux.<br /><br />The final is a greatest hits collection, which would probably contain the above two games, maybe some other unreleased stuff, and I believe an incomplete but updated from the demo version of Dead Moon.<br /><br />This is a good demo. The visuals are great. This came out in times when games this good weren't released often. This is starbux's greatest visual effort to date. 9/10 on graphics.<br /><br />The plot is good, from what I understand. Although slow at the beginning, after a while alot is happening. I think... Dave Grohl makes a cameo, too. 7/10 on plot.<br /><br />The game's music, although not programmed by starbux himself, seemingly fits into whatever situation it is in in the game. We hear some good Final Fantasy music from Blazer, and some original music from myself and Viovis. 7/10 on music.<br /><br />I've got to commend this game for having alot of cool engines, and the like. Although bux's 3D Interactive Battle engine isn't near perfect (it's actually rather flawed), it was a grand idea. He also has a regular good old RPG engine (where's an RPG game without one?) and a cool engine where you kill trolls.<br /><br />The one problem I have with the troll engine is that the timing goes by way too fast. It works just dandy, but you're timed and you aren't given enough time, in my opinion. 7/10 on programming.<br /><br />9/10, 7/10, 7/10, 7/10 -- 30/40<br /><br />Definitely a game to play if you haven't already.

The art, however, serves to highlight how dreadful Chase is at writing - not just in composing sentences (&quot;When the clash of swords echo [sic], the journey chasing the past ends, and the journey to know today begins..&quot;), but also in knowing exactly how to pace his drama. For a guy who wants to become CAPTAIN HOLLYWOOD, Chase sure doesn't seem to understand how stories should work. Take the second intro screen, for example; the player is treated to a fantastic animated picture of our hero - one so detailed that his mouth and eyes move, and his hair sways in the breeze. Now a GOOD storyteller would - well, &lt;i&gt;tell the story&lt;/i&gt; and leave all the pretty animations as pleasant background details. Not Chase though! He has us sit there and be told that &quot;A calm wind brushes against your face. You close your eyes and breathe deeply&quot; (cue animation) &quot;BLAH BLAH you look down at the courtyard&quot; (cue animation) &quot;BLAH BLAH you watch people walking by&quot; (cue animation) until we really &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; how much detail has gone into the graphics. Of course, this is horrible to sit through; aggressive self-aggrandizement is never a pretty sight, especially when one is trying to enjoy a story. It's like JK Rowling stopping in the middle of a sentence and saying &quot;See? Isn't Severus Snape a clever name? Doesn't it just sound all EVIL?&quot; - it's ugly, intrusive and makes the author look like a twat.<br /><br />Sadly, Chase is unable to maintain the high level of graphics throughout the game; though the mountainside looks fantastic and some of the smaller villages are alright, pretty much all of the first city is horrible. Take the inside of the king's castle for example - Chase relies too much on diffused shading, so that everything lacks definition; walls blend into the floor blends into the carpets that almost hide tiny blue soldiers. In something like VGA it would have been okay, but when you have as few &quot;pixels&quot; as ZZT provides, the screen just looks like a jumble of random blobs. Yes you can pick out shops and fountains if you look closely, but the player shouldn't have to strain to make out where they're going. If the graphics are the best thing about this game and they aren't even all that good, you should have a rough idea of how fun this is to play.<br /><br />Okay, let's move along then shall we? The plot itself concerns a young man who is sent on a mission to get taxes from asuidsuifoh -- sorry, I lost consciousness and hit the keyboard with my head. Where was I? Oh right; this lad needs to get taxes for his king, who aims to get the four crystals of s;zghkljda -- crap, I did it again. Uhm, so this lad goes to the village but finds that they're suffering attacks by bandits rxzgkjhoih --oh look, I can't do it; the plot's just too dull. It may well have been ripped off from Suikoden - I haven't played that game - but at least there you apparently had an expansive game world and decent gameplay. Here you get-- well, let's take a look shall we?<br /><br />After the intro (which lasts about fifteen years), the first bit of 'gameplay' involves asking a guard for a password so you can leave the castle. Why on EARTH would you need a password to LEAVE the king's castle? Not only is this bit really stupid, it serves no purpose but to further delay the game proper. Whilst little stupid things like this may make the game last longer, it's something of a false economy. What's the point of making the game last another five minutes if those five minutes are boring? If Chase had put in some proper puzzles (perhaps you needed to knock a guard dog out with some poisoned meat) then at least the player would spend their time doing something entertaining.<br /><br />So you leave the castle and enter the (very ugly and pixilated) village. Again, you have to do a series of small but annoying and pointless little actions before the game can progress - go to the weapon shop, then return home to watch a cinema then FINALLY get the chance to leave the town and get on with the game. Frankly, this could have been solved by just being given a big sword and sent on your way ala Ned the Knight (which is surely the template for such games), but no! Instead you have to be introduced to your father, sister, friend and servant who all talk EXACTLY THE SAME. Seriously; there are no distinguishing features between any of these characters, except for their names and sexes. No doubt some of them will be bumped off as the series progresses but Chase is going to have to buck up his writing if he expects us to care about them.<br /><br />Right, we're outside and introduced to the crappiest world map ever. Firstly, there are the RPG battles - blue boxes &quot;randomly&quot; open up with the option to either fight or flee the baddies. In practice, this involves both sides attacking each other and doing &lt;i&gt;the same amount of damage each time&lt;/i&gt;. Seriously, would it have been so hard to knock up a randomizer, or at least give more options than just &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;run&quot;? All bad guys of the same type do the same amount of damage and take the same amount of attacks to kill. No variations, no spectacular hidden moves - why not just subtract 15 health and then die? Hell, sometimes you can't even run so your options are &quot;fight&quot; or - er - &quot;fight&quot;. And you still have to select the option, which just makes it even more irritating. <br /><br />Worse, there are little objects running about the maps that engage you in arcade-style fights, so that you have to barge into them a few times before they die. There's nothing to stop them attacking you during RPG fights, so that in-between the blue boxes you can be losing health from a pack of bats or something. <br /><br />And I haven't even started on the random deaths in the mountains! Stand too close to the edge and you'll die without warning! Push the wrong boulder and you'll die without warning! Step on a pressure plate and spears?ll skewer you! Question: Since when has arbitrary death ever been fun? Answer: NEVER!<br /><br />And what about the 'proper' RPG battles? Lifeless. You do damage on bad guys but there's no real indication (No flashing &quot;YOU DID DAMAGE TO THEIF 2!&quot; or injury animations), and the moves are distinctly unimaginative. In fact, the RPG fight against the cave thieves stuck after a bit, so I had to zap my way out.<br /><br />Which reminds me! The game has tonnes of bugs. Accidentally fail to select a name in the intro screen and you'll be stuck looking at your character's hair waving in the breeze forever. Accidentally fail to say yes or no to the chap in the castle and again you'll be stuck until you restart. Enter your house again after the &quot;father/sister&quot; cinema and you'll be flung to the start (though that might be a ZZT problem due to filesize). Only one of the exits from the cave leads to the correct cinema - the rest go straight to the fight. Gimlio's &quot;Dragon&quot; attack (I wonder where Chase 'borrowed' that from?) does nothing at all. These and many more mistakes appear throughout the game, frequently resulting in reloads. Apparently three people beta tested this game. Presumably they just skipped through a lot of it, because there's simply no plausible way that they could complete it without finding at least one crippling bug. And let's not forget the spelling mistakes! Chase is hardly the most literate gent in the universe, and though Herc did his best to find all of them, there are still little mistakes here and there (including a classic your/you're mix-up).<br /><br />This is a horrible, horrible game. It splutters and misfires repeatedly, is no fun to play whatsoever, has a thoroughly boring plot and even its best features - the graphics - are not without their problems. Final Fantasy gets a 0.5 for graphics and nothing for anything else. Do us a favour and learn from your mistakes, Chase.

"Not what I expected"☃"TTTPPP"☃☃"When I saw that there was a entry called ascii maker I assumed it would be an exe allowing you to make font files.  However this is far from that.<br />The engine is designed to create a face/player type picture for you.  The picture, instead of being character sized, is about 20x10 characters.  You walk along a line of objects which ask you things like 'Do you want a cape?' and 'What colour?'.  By the time you reach the end of the line you have a 'finished' picture.  Obviously the picture isn't very realistic as it is based on an expanded player character (char 1 I think).  If the program could create a realistic picture, or even a good cartoon style picture it would be a whole lot more entertaining.<br />Overall I can't see much point in this program, except to it's own ends."☃"1042453130"☃"Ascii--4.zip"☃"0.5"☃"131.111.8.101"
"Like a Merry-Go-Round"☃"TTTPPP"☃☃"This game is set entirely on two boards.  It is a simulation game, but not a great one.  The aim is to avoid death as far as I can tell.  You accumulate health, food, comfort, fun and wealth by running round your house and the town and getting objects to either give you something, or exchange one thing for another.  All the while you lose your comfort, food and fun points.  If one of the catorgories gets to zero you start to die.<br />I found that by working in the cafe and running between the shower, TV and returaunt I could stay alive indefinitely, and buy all of the stuff in the shops.<br />There was an occasional bug when stepping between the town and the house which caused me to die, and the watch dog seemed to do nothing.  Other than that the game seemed fairly well written, if a little small.<br />It could be improved by having more developement - eg better paid jobs which you have to be qualified to work in, and then more expensive things to put in your house, or a private jet allowing you to get to further towns.<br />Overall the game had minimal graphics and fairly poor game play."☃"1042542799"☃"Sms-Life.zip"☃"1.5"☃"131.111.8.102"

It uses the colours well, and for the first few boards has full background detail (scenery which you can get to).  However this fairly well stops by about the fourth or fifth board.<br />The aim of the game is to carry out tasks, though it's not always clear what to do next.  This, I think, brings out much of the fun in the game.  There were a couple of moments where I thought that I was fairly lucky to touch an object, but the majority of the time there are obvious objects, which tell you what needs to be done to them, or with them.  There is a bit of running back and forth and testing to see if things work or not, but it doesn't subtract from the game.<br />The game was a good length and had a sensible number of boards.<br />The only negative thing I have to say is that I wasn't too impressed with the ending, it seemed a little unexplained (especially the dark grey creature on one of the last few boards).

"A refreshing social commentary."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"    This game is drenched in political messages. Just from the opening title can you see the message is already clear, featuring a gun superimposed over an American flag. The design of the school itself is marvelously accurate in an abstract way. It's not that it's a &quot;school&quot;. It's a symbol of our school experience. There is little direction given to us as we procede. instead seemingly insignificant choices lead to our successes and failures, and (as the game poigantly illustrates) failure occours more often than success. Then we get to the shooting. the only actual shooting in the game is hardly a challange. You go into a classroom, and kill students, who are all alligned in a row waiting and come at you pretty much one at a time. no skill is required to get to the room, or even kill the students. in fact, if it's only the first time you've played the game then you usually think that you've come to the room accidently. And you're probably just as surprised as the students in the room. <br /><br />this game is a strong statement in a universal package. The graphics are abstract, and could concievealbly be any school. A remarkable piece of work indeed. "☃"1042849072"☃"schoolzzt.zip"☃"5"☃"134.241.2.49"

This is pointless including versions 1-5 if number six has all the capabilities as the others.  Anarchy should have left ASCII Maker one alone and kept it at that. With little features other than a new title screen, there is little difference between Collections three and four.  After you go through the maker once, that's about it, the end of the game.

"Pure genious in a glass"☃"TTTPPP"☃"tttppp123@hotmail.com"☃"Winter is an extremely well made game.  The boards line up seemlessly and the graphics give a wonderful sense of 'uniformity' to the game.<br />Plot:<br />There is a fairly limited plot in the game, but it's a puzzle game and doesn't really need one.  You are in a classroom and start to daydream... (see Flammable Monkey's review).  But basically the plot is of the sort - you are somewhere, but you want to be somewhere else.<br />Graphics:<br />The graphics are great, nice use of blues and whites to give the game a cold feel to it.  There are some very detailed boards and some which are just one big object.  Posibly the worst graphics was the top of the tree, which wasn't really bad at all.<br />Puzzles:<br />All of the puzzles were entertaining.  Without exception.  There was a fairly large range of puzzles as well, some revolving around key and door problems, some around memory, some mazes and some where the biggest puzzle is working out what the puzzle is.  There are a few which you can muck up badly enough that you can't go on, so it's worth saving before attempting each puzzle.<br />Sound:<br />This game uses little bleeps and twiddles to speak to you.  There is no text (words making a sentence type text) except in the info screen.  Instead you rely on things making happy arpedgios for good things, rising blips for something being turned on, etc.  This makes the game much more fluent than a game with large blue text boxes whenever you enter a room, or press a button, or whatever.<br />Overall:<br />This is probably the best puzzle game I have played from the archives, and posibly the best ZZT game of any sort I have played."☃"1043582795"☃"winter.zip"☃"5"☃"131.111.8.101"
"ZZT Nirvana"☃"Flaming"☃"OkComputer135@aol.com"☃"For Death Gate, it is not a matter if it is a five star game or not. Rather, it is a matter if you can have too much of a good thing in ZZT. You have five of the greatest minds in possibly the entire history of ZZT, Wil,  Zenith Nadir, Hercules, aetch, and Hydra78, coming together to make a single ZZT game. The thought of it is enough to put any ZZTer in heaven. But is it as good as we expected? The answer is undoubtfully yes. Death Gate brings out the best in each of the authors. Each contrasts the other to make it a superb gaming experience like no other, like a fine gourmet meal. From the  musical stylings of Wil and aetch, to the beautifully drawn boards of Hydra78 and Hercules, a graphical nirvana, and the wit and pure enjoyability of Zenith Nadir. And to top it all off, one of the most original and excellent science fiction plots, not only in ZZT, but quite possibly in all of science fiction. So, as far as Death Gate is concerned, you cannot have too much of a good thing."☃"1043706331"☃"dgate.zip"☃"5"☃"205.188.208.170"

"Planets"☃"Quantum"☃"christophermounce@gmail.com"☃"I'm surprised that this game hasn't received much attention.<br /><br />First, the disclaimer. As a game, Planets is only so-so. Controlling your ships is cumbersome. This can be forgiven to a certain extent - it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a ZZT game, and you've only got a few keys on the keyboard to work with. However, there are still a couple of glaring problems. For one, the programming is not idiot-proof. You have to be very careful when you move your ships, because it is possible to break the game. Attacking other ships (and the other player's planet) can be confusing. There isn't much strategy involved - both sides have the same number of ships, and all ships are equal, as far as I can tell. There are a few sound effects, but no music. The ending is lackluster.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, I'll tell you what I like about Planets. The engine is innovative and very ambitious. It is a &lt;i&gt;turn-based strategy game in ZZT&lt;/i&gt;, and as far as I know, it's the only one. The execution might not be stellar, but it isn't a horrible game either - it's fun to engage enemy ships and watch the health meters with suspense. The graphics are pretty good, too. What really strikes me, though, is that it was written in 1996, a year before ZZT was released as freeware. Now, I'm pretty sure this wasn't the first engine game ever, but it's early, it's advanced, and I'm surprised I haven't heard of it before (or seen a similar type of game in ZZT).<br /><br />It's not a brilliant game, but it does offer some entertainment value, and it's a clever little engine. Definitely worth a look."☃"1174100224"☃"planets.zip"☃"3"☃"140.142.173.84"

"A Rose wit but One Thorn"☃"Flaming"☃"OkComputer135@aol.com"☃"Wil's The Rose is considered one of his stranger games, but his work in this game conveys thoughts and emotions that many scriptwriters and literary authors are unable to in a movie or novel. He also tackles what can be one of the most intangible and unexplainable aspects of human nature, the dream, as the source of the plot. His plot is able to sequence very well, despite that this is much the opposite in some dreams, coming objects from the far past and the present, such as kings, queens, and Nintendo 64s. And be aware that it is a dream, or it will not make any sense to the player. The gloomy, yet excellent music and the dark graphics set the mood of the game. The contrasting colors of the last few art boards create an amazing effect and feeling as the sky is set ablaze. Wil conjures up such thoughts as an adolescent superhero, psychic powers, and a sky flaming with color as a single flower descends to the ground. But, as he suggests himself, every rose has its thorn, and The Rose's thorn is its lack of play and replayability, going against its claim of an interactive game.

Should I act smart? Should I act stupid? How should I type? What should I say? I had to learn these things the hard way. I was ridiculed for months by the likes of &quot;Power Hungry Admins&quot; and &quot;Zamros&quot; (Avoid zamros by all means, apparently.). Of course I didn't know of Zenith/Nadir's multiple personalities, either! The most surprising thing this game told me, though, was (with &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot; playing in the background) the fact that there is a FEMALE ZZTER. This is groundbreaking. The first female zzter, apparently, is KRACKEN. I bet you didn't know that!<br /><br />So, in the vein of the music of the game, the ZZT community may be &quot;Complicated,&quot; and keeping up with the times may be &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot; and it might leave you &quot;Naked,&quot; GameMstr1 wants you to not &quot;Lose your Grip&quot; and to know that he's &quot;With You.&quot; Play this game, and you'll be &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;<br /><br />Could he make it any more obvious?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />"☃"1045936748"☃"Howtozzt.zip"☃"5"☃"24.186.251.27"

"My Favorite ZZT Game Ever"☃"CallMeText"☃"SuperWario@aol.com"☃"This was my favorite game I ever played. Back when I started playing ZZT, there were so many bad games, but this one actually played on the fact that the game was bad. The entire point of a boring game, for some unknown reason was entertaining. Its a strange paradox, which this game captures easily. Its on my list of one of the first ZZT games you should play. If playing this game as a newbie, you get the chance to understand the basics of ZZT very well. If you've never played this game, then you are in for a treat. With no storyline, limited action, intentional pointlessness, it may seem like a worthless game. But play it for 5-10 minutes, and you realize that this game is truly a work of art on many levels."☃"1046051324"☃"Boring.zip"☃"5"☃"205.188.208.170"

"CFRVRFZZTG: [A]"☃"catfriedrice"☃"catfriedrice83@hotmail.com"☃"GRAPHICS: Uses STK. Mostly brown boards. After Part 3, everything is red. After Part 4, everything turns gray.  The only drawback is F3 color water. [4]<br /><br />GAMEPLAY: Mostly walk and shoot basic enemys.  There are two major bugs in this game. The first comes when you &quot;slide down the slope.&quot; should you get hit by any of the creatures, you have to restart the game.  The only other bug comes from the bosses. Should you continue to attack the boss even after it runs out of life, it will continue to attack you and NOT die. [3]<br /><br />SOUND: No music, but there is sound effects [3]<br /><br />SPELLING/LANGUAGE: Story is well written, help is useful. Everything seems to be spelled correctly [5]<br /><br />OOP USE:Good use of oop with the bosses, except for the two bugs mentioned above and the last boss who uses WAY TOO MANY STARS [3]<br /><br />SATISFACTION: Well thought out and designed, but the constant mazes and enemys made this game boring.  The last boss also gave me a headache, I lost 1000 Health from his constant starthrowing.

"Excellent"☃"KevDude"☃"grasso0317@suscom.net"☃"This was a simply great game. It had me addicted until I finished. I only had a couple problems with the game.<br />Problem-O-Meter<br />5- extremly annoying<br />4<br />3- irritating<br />2<br />1- mild pest<br /><br />Shooting: 3<br />There was only one shot allowed at a time. I understand the reason for this, but it often gets annoying when you miss and have to wait until it hits the other side. Also, the game feels like you have unlimited ammo(which you don't). I found at one point I had no ammo and had to restart from the begining. There were VERY few objects that would give you ammo when killed. I would suggest an infinite ammo engine that would pause when you shot.<br />(something like:<br />#give ammo 1<br />/i#take ammo 1 /i/i/i/i<br />#restart)<br /><br />gems:2<br />When shot, gems disapear. This led to a shortage at the end for me. I eventually learned the point to stop shooting, but it would make it easier for the player to make them objects like the hearts. Also, the object that checked if I had enough games to pass didn't tell me how many I needed to pass. This could be annoying for the player to go to it with many gems and not know how many it needs before he should return to that point.<br /><br />Luckily these didn't subtract much from the gameplay and I give it a 4 "☃"1046577882"☃"WayneAd.zip"☃"4"☃"64.78.77.157"

"A good game with some very annoying bugs"☃"aaronthenuggetdawson"☃"alwayssaved@hotmail.com"☃"       Final Fantasy Disc 1.....<br /><br />    Anyone who plays this game, you<br />must remember. Remember that Chase is a very bad programmer with a very good artistic side. This really shows in<br />FFD1. There are some very big bugs in this game (the only move I could damage<br />anyone with was MINUS STRIKE), and even a passage in the middle of nowhere that led to the Title Screen. Normally, this would mean a very bad game, except Chase manages to do this with style.<br />In the beginning, you are treated to a cutscene of a blue falling star. There is a cutscene of your character's hair swaying in the wind (albeit, he has an idiotic smile), and a very good view of the side of the mountain. In sound, he does a very good remake of the FFIX<br />title song on the title screen, and even has the classic FF victory theme.<br />    Now, the story... This story is blatantly ripped from Suikoden, a Playstation One game made in 1997. Still, if you're going to take other people's stories, take the BEST ones.<br />Chase did just that.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />GRAPHICS: &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; out of &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br />SOUND: &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; out of &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br />STORY: &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; out of &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br />ORIGINALITY: &lt;&gt;&lt;. out of &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br />        (He RIPPED the story)<br />GAMEPLAY: &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; out of &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br />     (Due to some unforgivable bugs)<br /><br />Until next time, Aaron fans!<br />Over and Nanu Nanoo!<br />(MY FAVORITE WiL GAME IS THE ROSE!)<br />@}-,-'-"☃"1046900952"☃"ffdisc1.zip"☃"4"☃"67.26.84.147"

Fun and varied spy type gameplay combined with strong polt-oriented action makes for a very enjoyable game that makes you want to play through to the end. The graphics range from glorious (Atomic blast, various cities) to aburdly not grounded in reality (Lenin's body is huge! and you climb the banister of the profile of stairs.) All of the buildings you walk around at drawn completely from the top down, giving no element of 3-d. This really only looks odd because of the wide varity of colours used and it seems like it would be more condusive to graphics with depth.

☃"double berry"☃"yotsua@aol.com"☃"One of the most unique and thought-provoking games ever made, Coolart is a fascinating tale of religion, history, and superstition that ranks among the least-known underdogs of all time. The game is set in the 10th and 11th centuries AD, during the Heian period in Japan when Kyoto was known as Heiankyo. The game includes episodes drawn from a large body of tales, legends and illustrated literature produced during or after the Heian period. These vignettes are edited into interactive, experiental forms, to allow the user to realistically sense the worldview and lifestyle of an ancient time. The game was inspired by The Tales of Genji and similar Japanese folktales. <br />Your character in the game is a no-name male traveler, an ordinary human being who is faced with opportunities, driven by desires, and is bound to die. Your actions determine your path through this world, and many reincarnations to come. You may meet troublemakers, and demons, enter Paradise or Hell, be reborn, and re-enact the story of a scholar who played the devil in a high-stakes game of backgammon. In addition to very well-drawn authentic backgrounds, the game includes an excellent database of over 400 screens of text and pictures that gives background information for the time and place where you are in the game. <br /><br />Calling Coolart a &quot;game&quot; is a bit misleading-- you don't get to solve any elaborate puzzles in traditional point-and-click adventure sense. Any item you carry with you will be used automatically when the time comes, so you can't really get &quot;stuck&quot; in the game. Coolart is better described as an interactive story that lets you interact with the game world at your leisure, similar to choose-your-own-adventure books. And what a world it is. The designers spare no pretense, no illusion that this is a &quot;politically correct&quot; or &quot;family&quot; game. Heiankyo comes alive before your very eyes, with all the gory details and harrowing images that its inhabitants truly faced or believed. You will come across a dog eating a corpse's entrails, long-winded old farts, a monk leading a prayer meeting, kids playing ball in the streets, a maiden with an obscenely phallic tongue, and many more true-to-life characters. And when you get to the underworld (yes, you *must* die in this game. Several times, in fact), you will find hellish scenes populated with sharp-toothed demons and tormented souls that are so effective as to churn your stomach. These characters are drawn with vivid facial characteristics, a cross between the cartoons of medieval Japanese art and the exaggerations of modern Japanimation. The speaking voices are filled with personality, often taunting, teasing, or sexy. They all speak Japanese (in the ancient tongue, no less), but all speech is subtitled in English. <br /><br />What makes Coolart truly remarkable is that as you enter the town and interact with its inhabitants, you have only two choices. You can, in your arrogance, remain as you are, a contemporary Japanese or American, for example. And you won't get very far. The structure of relations that are the real art of the work won't let you. It does not allow this nonchalance with meaning. A more interesting choice is to try and understand the world as it would have appeared to a person of the time. Then you start to make your decisions, when you meet the guard, or the priest, or the gambler, according to someone else's meaning making map of Kyoto, and indeed of the world. You work within the constraints the artists have placed in the matrix of relations that are the art of this work. The look and feel of it are just window dressing. They are not art, they are design. The art is the in the relations. Follow along the line of those relations, and you learn what it means to be in the world as the world appears from the point of view of Pure Land Buddhism. <br /><br />As Roger Ebert concludes in his review, &quot;There is the sense, illusory but seductive, that one could wander this world indefinitely. This is a wonderful game.&quot; This truly wonderful, delightfully twisted path to enlightenment is well worth the honor of being one of the few full CD-ROM games on the site (yes, that big zip file contains the whole CD). A must-have, especially for anyone looking for a mature, meditative game that is a far cry from today's superficial releases."☃"1048952496"☃"COOLART.zip"☃"5"☃"172.180.252.225"

"Again?"☃"John W. Wells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"The Kane Project 4 is, well, a lot like most of the other games Master Raze has made.<br /><br />Graphics:<br /><br />The cutscenes are passable, and sometimes good. However, the gameplay boards are generally rather flat and lifeless. The streets of the city look rather like a typical dungeon, except with walls of big, blue blocks that are meant to represent rooftops, and the final battle looks particularly lackluster.<br /><br />Writing:<br /><br />Well, my expectations were pretty low here, and Master Raze met them. TKP4 is filled with flat situations and sophomoric humor so overstated as to make MY jokes look subtle - which is no mean feat. Its plotline manages to be stale yet maintain a charming incomprehensibility at times. Also, a proofreader would be welcome here.<br /><br />But there is one good line about the habits of serial killers in movies...<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />Many games have predictable plots, but Master Raze has managed to do the seemingly impossible. He has managed to combine a variety of different types of action, and yet still keep the entire game on a predictable track.<br /><br />The reason for this is as follows: anybody who has played Master Raze's other games - and I know there are a few others of you out there - has seen all there is to see here, pretty much. There are one or two ideas he hasn't used before, but most of the game is very familiar.<br /><br />I mean, what other author could possibly make you say:<br /><br />&quot;Okay, a break-in sequence is coming up, so that means I'll have to access some computers to open doors, sneak behind guards to break their necks, maybe hide from some cameras, and possibly get a password. Afterwards, I'll end up in a forest or jungle or something, pursued by animals that I really shouldn't kill, because I don't want to run out of ammo. There might be some fistfighting action, which basically amound to touching objects instead of shooting them. The objects might run away when I chase them while simultaneously decreasing my health.&quot;<br /><br />It's not BAD gameplay, for the most part, but it's getting old fast.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Effort definitely went into this on some level; all of those cutscenes and battles didn't come out of thin air. But it all feels suspiciously like a Mr. Potato Head approach to design; begin with a dull, plastic thing and add on the premade parts. This is very popular in Hollywood; I mean, TKP4 is AT LEAST as original as [insert latest buddy action movie here], but Raze could do a lot better."☃"1049151542"☃"tkp4.zip"☃"3"☃"131.215.90.164"
"Not bad"☃"YipplyYAya"☃"squirtlerulez@yahoo.com"☃"This game was rather entertaining...though i don't like it. Its graphics were not bad though. for another opinion, refer to below...<br />I hate Role Playing Games. For so many reasons over so many years, I have never gotten the same enjoyment from them that others have. I never liked the cute cartoony characters or turn based combat, nor today's FMV smothered fodder crammed with heroes named ''Squall Valiannartessions.'' The only reason I ever gave Nipple Saga a chance was its name; I love the Nipple games so I got it. I never expected to like it, and really never expected to love it. Truth be told, it is one of the greatest games ever released and really deserves all the hype that other RPGs now get. The Game This is one damn fine playing game. The story revolves around a young man named Nippleanus, member of a crew performing freelance missions for der Doktor. The ship is overtaken and Nippleanus's own Doctor (and surrogate father, essentially) is slain before him by der Doktor von Bagstein himself. Before you get knocked unconscious, you witness Bagstein's men steal an artifact resembling a coffin from some ruins... then comes the pistol whippin'. You black out, and arise at the bottom of a cave, feeling hopeless. Your anus comes to your rescue, and so the adventure begins... The game has three basic playing modes: Flying around on your anus, exploring on foot, and combat on the anus. All are well implemented; the majority is on the anus, and controlling it is as natural as could be. The game will send you flying across large bodies of water, through ravines, over tundra; the flying is very similar to the preceding Nipple games, only not as deft (these are exploration sequences). Pressing the A button brings up the targeting icon; anything accessible can be highlighted and interacted with via this system. It comes together perfectly for an RPG, especially considering how much of it is rooted in shooter. The on-foot moments are actually similar to the flying; you roam around, but all interaction takes place with the targeting icon. While sounding awkward simply for running, it is really quite fitting; often there are several items you can look over, and you can choose among them without moving around. The game's combat system is phenomenal. Forget all the boring turn-waiting and cutesy stuff; Nipple Saga came to play. It isn't as fast as the shooter iterations, as this is an RPG, but the pacing of the battles is amazing. You're given a set of meters that fill over time. You can perform certain tasks according to your amount of meters filled; thus the give-or-take strategy planning begins. Do you hit with a bunch of one meter attacks, or wait for some more powerful 2 meter attacks? Time can be of the essence, and some of the more epic battles will have your hands sweating as you try to decide the best course of action. As you play on, the Doctor evolves and changes into new Robo-Doctor types. This means he's more powerful and more resilient towards attacks, just as Nippleanus is when gaining experience. When your Doctor learns Berserk commands, you're given a whole new class of ''spells.'' The intervals at which you're given access to the new features is perfect; you get them right when you're ready for something new. There is also NO need for ''leveling up.'' The game makes sure that if you play the game through, you will be powerful enough without ever having to spend useless time fighting ridiculous amounts of repetitive enemies just to feel adequate. Thematically, Nipple Saga (as well as all of the Nipple games) has no equal. The enemies you fight, the doctor, the quirky people you meet- this is a far away universe that really should be closer. The range of monsters really makes it seem as if the world you're venturing through has different species and classes; not just random ugly creatures, but actual populations living amongst the humanoids. The areas and levels are very appropriate residences for the characters, accurate and fitting without exception. The story goes on to become so much more than it starts with; the importance of the being in the coffin, etc. It all comes together almost without hitch. The sole problem in its execution is that it can be hard to discern a few alliances towards the end of the game; this doesn't kill the story at all, but is rather just a bur in the saddle. Play the game through over a short period of time and the story will reward you like few others in gaming. Side note: While it says on the back of the case that NS offers the ''Uncompromising Conclusion'' to the Nipple lineage, that is FAR from the truth. The ending is not bad, but it is NOT what is advertised... The Delivery Nipple Saga has it's graphical highs and lows. The shimmering water is the best seen on the PC (or the XBox), and the Doctor is a beautiful model considering the hardware. He bends and maneuvers beautifully; in fact all the animations of the game are excellent. Berserk effects are also dynamite, with plenty of pretty colors and lighting erupting from the attacks. The game even fakes some great reflections in a few areas, a feat never handled with much grace by the ZZT. The lows however, are some pretty gritty looking structures in the walking segments, and some rough character models for the human(oid)s. This is 32 bit 3D stuff here, so it isn't bad at all considering the hardware, it just isn't the best of its league. The overall visual presentation is still superb; the theme is rendered exquisitely and the intentions of the developer are well executed. The music is almost eerily fitting. It's as if the levels themselves designed the music; from the bongo-style rhythms of Dir en Grey to the digital woodwinds of Initial D music, the stuff is the aural representation of the visuals. The track that accompanies regular outdoor battles is a perfect example; no other track could ever capture the moment like that, as it blends the constant motion and primitive-yet-advanced theme the game so brilliantly delivers. The Truth I once thought I would never review this game simply because I don't think I could do it justice. Although I overcame that hurdle, this review is far from doing right by Nipple Saga. It is worth its ridiculous prices on ebay. I hate RPGs and this is still one of the best games I've ever played. Ignore the commercials on TV for so many other games you'll be able to rent to find out they aren't worthy. Nipple Saga is amazing, stellar; how could the ZZT not succeed with JUST this game on it? Find this game and pay the money and yell at other people to do the same. "☃"1049169991"☃"Nipsaga.zip"☃"5"☃"202.156.2.90"
"A very good dungeon crawl."☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"The dungeon crawl is hardly a neglected genre of ZZT game. Generally, the gameplay involves conserving torches and ammo, beating hordes of monsters, and eventually facing some kind of end boss. It takes skill to add something new to the formula.<br /><br />Madtom does so superbly. A few elements of strategy raise Respite above the endless stream of identical games that I've seen. In particular, a system of sacrifices and prayers adds a role-playing element that the game would otherwise lack, and a series of &quot;challenges&quot; revealed at the end of the game (trying to get through without praying, for example) greatly enhance replayability.<br /><br />There's just enough personality and plot in Respite to keep things moving. The writing isn't brilliant, but it's acceptable, which is better than just about any other ZZT game I've seen. It's not Burglar!, but it doesn't have to be. It's a dungeon crawl.<br /><br />One word: this is _not_ an easy game. At a few points, it can get pretty hairy.

"APPEASEMENT"☃"Terryn"☃"achristi@bradley.edu"☃"I was going to write up something anyway, but I guess I'll dedicate this review in the name of Funk! =.  <br /><br />NOW GIMME BACK MY &quot;NO SOLICITORS&quot; SIGN.  &lt;b&gt;AND THAT BOX FULL OF KITTENS&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />ESP is a large story-based ZZT game with several snippits of gameplay interspersed; sometimes it's an inventory game, sometimes it's an action game, and once or twice it's even both.<br /><br />The game's strongest point is the writing.  The descriptions are verbose enough to please while the The humor (in my horrible opinion; rating humor is a purely subjective task) ranged from slightly droll to pretty amusing; nothing was horrible save for what was intended to be horrible (well, except maybe the horse joke).  The plot, while truthfully less relevant than it was when Wells originally started work on ESP, was implemented very well. It involves a tricky man named Cleatle who sneaks into the Protest Party headquarters and suggests confuddling up the ballot system to gain more votes.  Despite his means of entering, he's inducted into the Protest Party and is sent out to get the ballot scanned.  The rest clumps together in an odd mess from there on, and I'd rather not give out plot points on a strongly written game when the game itself does ton(ne)s better.<br /><br />Oh, let me point out that I noticed two typos thoughout playing the game.  TWO.  Considering there's enough text to fill at least a novelette and _especially_ considering that this is a homebrewed game, that's about as likely as ...ah hell, I can't come up with a simile that won't make me sound elitist. :&lt;  But you get the picture!<br /><br />As for the gameplay, the inventory game was well-programmed.  Several (and I mean SEVERAL) specific but pointless inventory reactions were put in. Also, some of the puzzles were pretty devious. (I ended up using the help file twice; once to get that pocketwatch and the other because I was blind and couldn't see a docked boat.)<br /><br />The action scenes are widly varying; they range from simple bullet evasion to a run'n'gun type game.  About the only flaw is the large head start you can get in the first minigame, but that's nothing game-destroying. <br /><br />(For those of you just in for the story, pretty much all of the action scenes can be skipped over.)<br /><br />The artwork thoughout is quite sharp.  Funk contributed to the first file; Zenith to the second and fourth; Rob_P to the third.  The art styles, while abviously varying from artist to artist, didn't conflict heavily enough to cause problems.<br /><br />It's nice, really!  I was expecting good things from this game, and I'm glad that I wasn't disappointed.  It's the first ZZT game I bothered to download in quite a while."☃"1049413484"☃"Esp.zip"☃"5"☃"136.176.200.202"

"Totally Whack Yo"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"    ESP is a game that has been anticipated for a long time. Does it hold up to the hype? <br /><br />    Yes. Altough I was disapointed slightly. Because this is a massive game, (4 files) I'm going to have to resort to dividing up the review into sections. <br /><br />Story: The premise is very clever, and it's one thing to have a clever premise, it's another to be able to follow through with it to the end. Wells, who is known for his attention to writing, can support his bark with his bite. The game is layered and while some of the things within the game become absurd and seem to have little to do with the main point, it all flows and aids in creating a world where it might be possible that a group of Sorcerers might take over and hypnotise people to win an election. Sometimes however things get to detracted and by the time you get back to the main story, you're confused as to what had been going on. The sections in between are as wordy as the main plot and while it maintains the writing standard that is somewhat expected, though not entirely necessary, it puts much between the main theme of the game and the side parts.<br /><br />Gameplay: For a game thick with story ESP still squeezes out a good amount of gameplay. You can skip a lot of it and you can also cheat to great degree as allowed by the programmer. The engines were well done for the most part. The RPG battle was a little stale albiet humourous. (On a separate note the boat ride was similar to one my airplane engines hehe:)) The shooting game play plays a bit weak and some scenes incorperate stars which in my opinion should be avoided at _almost_ all costs. In general though the gameplay, while varied, was not totally entertaining, skipping it seemed wrong though and I felt left out of the action of the game. The fact that you switched between characters was a good feature though that added depth to both the gameplay and the story.<br /><br />Music: I think I might be the only one to notice that the title screen music was a poor rendition of &quot;VGA Trek&quot;. The music was very good in some parts and annoying in other parts. But there was music throughout which while a feature for most games to-day, is hardly the standard for ZZT games.<br /><br />Graphics: Ranged from awesome to radical. There was depth, perspective. Some of the best graphics I've seen in ZZT and even better than some MZX games. The combination of artisits is noticible but does not detract from te game at all. <br /><br />Overall: The graphics and the story make up the brunt of the &quot;game&quot;. Given the option of being able to skip a lot of the playing parts, it plays more like an interactive movie. This is the problem with ZZT, get too involved in story and it's hard to make the game a game. ESP is one of the best things to come around in a while, but there are still better games out there. I'd give it a five for the sake of effort on the parts of all the programming writing and drawing, but if that's what earns a movie five stars, The Core will sweep the Oscars next time around.

"&quot;Look, Ozy! I got a broadsword!&quot;"☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"Overview:<br /><br />Anthropomorphic animal characters.<br /><br />Cartoonish, lively graphics.<br /><br />Occasional ALL CAPS interjections.<br /><br />Yep, Frost 1 is about as Zenith Nadir-y as you can get. Is this a bad thing? Well, that's a matter of taste, I suppose, but there's no way Nadir's technical skill can be faulted here, nor his sense of timing. This is a fun game.<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />The plotline is fairly standard RPG stuff; we get an ominous hint in the opening that Something Bigger is happening, and then the game jumps to the main character, a teenager who makes a rather important discovery about herself, like all teenage RPG heroes. No, she isn't heir to the throne or anything like that, nor do her parents suddenly get killed off, but the device that's used here is still pretty ageworn.<br /><br />The game continues along a fairly predicatable track, with some pretty common stock scenes and a &quot;find a pet's owner&quot; quest. Nothing immensely original, but it could be worse; it could be incomprehensible (see most trippy games).<br /><br />Writing:<br /><br />But even the most tired plot can be made to shine with solid writing, and, thankfully, Zenith pulls through here. The characters are satisfactory, and the pacing is excellent. Clunky exposition is kept to a minimum - although, as the first game is meant to set up the world, there is definitely some there - and the dialogue isn't overlong.<br /><br />I, personally, find the authorial interjections annoying. At times, Zenith clearly puts his own catchphrases and bits of random silliness in the mouths of the characters. Even worse, it occasionally... OCCASIONALLY got a laugh from me, so I couldn't quite ignore it, either. That's a nasty thing to do, throw inanities around and then surprise me with humor. For shame.<br /><br />Of course, I consider the amount of cursing excessive. What else is new?<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />The gameplay sections of Frost 1 are solid. There's a swordplay Simon Says sequence and a bunch of forest and swamp screens with monsters to fight. This isn't anything new, but it's done very smoothly and competently. The monsters require a bit of work to beat sometimes - and there's one really great moment of blind panic. It's telegraphed, but that somehow makes it better.<br /><br />The game does take a bit of time to get going, but once it does, it does. I prefer to think of the pacing as &quot;excellently done and unhurried,&quot; as opposed to &quot;long setup, no payoff yet.&quot;<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />It's MadTom. It's good, what there is of it.<br /><br />Graphics:<br /><br />So, you can have Suikoden Fantasy, where the graphics are the best thing in the game, but are basically just look pretty, or you can have Frost 1, where the graphics are the best thing in the game, and seem to define its personality and give it a great sense of fun.<br /><br />Programming:<br /><br />I didn't run into any bugs, everything was neatly executed, and the masses of enemies worked well.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />A fun, if short, game. Let's see more of these."☃"1062906217"☃"frost1.zip"☃"4.5"☃"131.215.158.186"
"Yay Yay Happy Happy"☃"Appliance"☃☃"Frost is one of those ZZT games that makes me happy when I play it. NOT beacause of the sexy fox mind you! Anyway...this game is very record breaking for me beacause it's the first Sword-engine game that I liked. Though it would have been cool if you could use the sword from the begining of the game and could parry and thrust and crap. The dialouge was great and the charactors were good. The only problem was that in a vew scenes it moved too fast (at the bottom of the screen). The music was amazing. Though I was dissapointed by the fact that there were only two tracks, quality over quantity I guess. Overall, though a little short, and with a few very minor flaws, this game is close enogh to perfection and deserves a 5.<br /><br />     The End"☃"1062870926"☃"frost1.zip"☃"5"☃"68.119.35.32"

"...YES."☃"Zandor"☃"jtabor12@yahoo.com"☃"Develin releases a lot of games, and it's been interesting watching him improve.  He's certainly come a long way since Water World (which I think he uploaded but it wasn't added).  The game itself is nothing great, and The Cabin is just his own version of a 24HoZ game he played, but still... there's this weird quality about his games, maybe untapped or partially tapped potential or something like that.<br /><br />There's still no trace of sound or music, but that's probably for the best- music is the hardest thing in ZZT to do well.  His graphics are somewhat better now too, with more shading and textures.  His programming is also growing more complex, with the game having some nicely done cinemas.<br /><br />The Develin's lair room at the beginning is still nothing but a big empty room, though- some kind of detail there would be nice.  There's also some annoying flashing on the menu screen, although it's not too bad.  All in all there aren't any major flaws with the game.<br /><br />Keep at it man, you're getting a lot better.

But then, I was thrown into a opening level where there was a few things to touch, but none of them did anything!  <br /><br />Once I figured out that you were just supposed to open a door, I went to the next board.  An invisomaze.  Alright, alright, what's next?  Another invisomaze.  And...?  ANOTHER INVISOMAZE!  3 in a row.  NOT.  FUN.

"Hastily done."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"Mega Man has the appearance of a well made game from the title and opening sequence, but when you finally get to the gameplay you're left with a stale game that just seems to frustrate you.<br /><br />The side scrolling action is poorly designed with jumping not able to be preformed at the same time as moving without some difficulty. The majority of the levels involve weaving your way through guns that shoot far too frequently and there are many times where it's near impossible not to be shot when bullets are comming at you from above and the side at the same time. The boss battles leave much to be desired. One of the X bots is killed by a defensive gun's bullets and the second one can be shot safely from underneath through the water that's used as a platform. Magman only needs to be shot through the feet with a stream of bullets then taken out from behind. For some odd reason his head throws stars which can't hurt another object. Later you ride a raft down a lava flow which means you dodge rocks(bullets again) for a period of time. After that you fight a volcano which you can saftly attack from the side defeating all of its shooting elements and leaving you to clear the rest of the breakable boss looking for it's &quot;weak spot&quot;. Fire man, the final boss give you a challange that makes it more like a game, but the odd thing is that whilst in the previous side-scrolling levels you had an infinite amount of ammo, in these fights you do not have that luxery which means the meagre amount of ammo you collected throughout the game depletes quickly.<br /><br />A good idea that could have been executed a little better, Mega Man can be fun if you can get past the annoying first few levels and over the fact that the bosses are push overs."☃"1049900621"☃"mmzzt.zip"☃"2.5"☃"68.112.244.46"

"Awesome."☃"Relm the IV"☃"viovis_and_knightt_are_evil@yahoo.com"☃" Labyrinth... now that I have played it,<br />I know. This game takes place in the Dark Ages (circa 1150 A.D.) in medieval<br />England. You play the role of Dr. Sigmus<br />Harper, one of the King's head researchers on foreign plants. While searching for a magnifying glass to examine a new specimen of Comorosa (Phaetus Comorosa), you stumble into a meeting between the King and a man in dark armor. They are talking quietly, but you hear them say something about &quot;gems&quot;, &quot;mines&quot;, and the kingdom's holy object, the Rienholc Vial. When the king spots you, he orders you thrown in the Labyrinth, a giant maze-like dungeon outside of the castle. And so you set off. I don't want to say too much on the plot, but rest assured that you stop the King.<br />This is a great game, and one of the 12 that actually deserve a &quot;5&quot;.<br /><br />*Graphics-- Excellent, especially on the<br />13 RPG battles. One of the boards (the &quot;gatehouse&quot;) seems a bit sterile, though. 4.9<br /><br />*Sound-- Again excellent. The music sounds like it could be coming from the mind of Wil. There is also a near perfect rendition of &quot;From the hall of the Mountain King&quot; near the end. 5.0<br /><br />*Plot-- I can't detail it too much, but the plot is the best thing about the game. 5.0<br /><br />*Programming/Spelling-- There are no spelling errors or bad programs, which is amazing for a three file game. 5.0<br /><br />*Overall (Not an average)-- 5.0<br /><br />#end"☃"1050133663"☃"labyrint.zip"☃"5"☃"67.3.35.183"

You can make instant background fades, without having to spend hours getting it to look just right.

It even makes newly created boards completely blank; that's right, no yellow borders.<br /><br />Having surpassed the buggy Kevedit as the leading ZZT editor, ZZTAE isn't without it's own share of bugs.  You still have a chance of corrupting your ZZT, forcing the nervous, pessimistic ZZTers to constantly have to make back-ups.<br /><br />This problem aside, ZZTAE is far better to use than ZZT.  You still need ZZT to test your game though; ZZTAE is a true blue editor, no exceptions.  If you don't think ZZTAE is for you, get it anyway.

Daylight burns the vampires, mistake number one. Feeding of an animal, that's correct, but feeding off too many would make the vampire feel ill. One wolf would probly keep the vampire fine for one night. A vampire walks into a village, what happens, nothing. A vampire hides itself, looks human, so it can feed easily. One human is all that's needed. AND YOU DON'T FEED OFF THE DEAD! OKay, the Brujah, yes. An anarchistic clan, but not so good as uniting. They are mostly against revealing themselves.

"Finally, a Euler circuit based puzzle game!"☃"Quantum P."☃"cipher110@yahoo.com"☃"I thought this was a pretty neat puzzle game. The player walks through a randomly generated maze, trying to collect as many gems as possible while avoiding the deadly ammo things. The engine is designed so that the player leaves behind a trail of solid wall; this keeps you from following the same path twice.<br /><br />Backtrax is just fine as an engine, but it would be much better, like Commodore said, if there was something else added to the challenge. I would have really liked a time limit system; maybe torches could give you more time, and ammo would take away time, instead of health. Another way would be to have an object running through the maze, instead of the player; you could program it so that it would be constantly moving, giving you little time to make a decision.<br /><br />Still, Backtrax was pretty good, despite its small size. For the unique idea and great programming, I'll give triphEd a 4."☃"1054305749"☃"BACKTRAX.zip"☃"4"☃"67.160.83.215"

"You probably already know this..."☃"Ryan Ferneau"☃"rferneau@iastate.edu"☃"I thought this game was really cool when it first came out.  That was when I only played TOWN.ZZT, DEMO.ZZT, and TOUR.ZZT, and I couldn't even edit Town or Tour.  I totally wanted to get Caves, Dungeons, and City, but I could never convince my parents to pay for them, y'know?  I also thought it would be cool if I could send in a game board for Best of ZZT, but that never happened.<br /><br />Anyway, I found that the coolest part of ZZT was that the level editor could create games just like the ones that came with ZZT.  I was used to games like Think Quick that put limitations on how much you could make your games like the pre-packaged ones, so as I explored ZZT, it turned out to be a real treat to duplicate all of the tricks in Town and more.  Probably the pinnacle of ZZT's flexibility is its &quot;object-oriented&quot; language for programming your own game characters.  There are dozens upon dozens of ways for these objects to interact with the player and spice up the game.<br /><br />When the Internet got to be a really big thing, making ZZT games also grew in popularity.  Now you can share your work with friends all over the world and try to get some recognition.  There are plenty of places to look for free games to download.  Although Tim Sweeney may have missed a few ways to improve ZZT, its sheer replayability earns it a 5."☃"1054881091"☃"zzt.zip"☃"5"☃"167.142.21.190"

All were put in to make the game different-- perhaps the author is trying to make a dungeon crawl funny? Well anyway, in area of comedy, this game gets onthing. Every time you kill an enemy, your character says something retarded like &quot;OMG UR HOT AND STRONG&quot; or &quot;MUSCLE BITCH STRUTTIN HER SHIT&quot; or whatever. My point is, the &quot;comedy&quot; was completely unnecessary, and it wasn't funny.<br /><br />However, the game was good. You basically run around and hit things, occasionally shooting them. The enemies are stupid, and it's very easy to get succesive hits on them, so the whole game is pretty much press up a bunch of times until the enemy dies. Nothing new.<br /><br />But, it also has two little gimmicks stolen from ADOM: Sacrificing and Praying! When you kill something, you can burn it to make Kung-Fu Jesus or whatever love you more! Then you can pray to him and he'll like you less! Oh what fun!<br /><br />The game is good, but not perfect, like the people above stated."☃"1055546806"☃"respite.zip"☃"4.5"☃"66.52.245.140"

There was no description to tell you where you were and the graphics were too poor to show you. I'm still not sure where or what time period the game is set in. (Modern time probably but what else? We need info!)<br /><br />The fighting was poor with monsters that many times take more bullets to kill than the ammo they give you. They move and shoot randomly. The bosses /seek you at cycle 3 allowing you to defeat them easily simply by firing a steady stream of bullets straight at them. The music was pretty good in many places and helped smooth out the (many) rougher areas of this game.<br /><br />Some fun is to be had, but not too much.

But could not, because the game engine as it is breaches the 20kb runtime limit (hence the &quot;bugs&quot;).<br /><br />It's also worth taking in the context of its time; back in 1999, much like the &quot;can gta be made in zzt&quot; arguments of today, people were trying for a ZZT Tetris engine for some reason. Nobody could do it, even the best programmers around- then Masamune, previously known almost purely for hanging around in #darkdigital a lot, made the ZZTris engine and left shortly after.<br /><br />My point?

"Required play."☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"This was the third ZZT game I ever played (after Town and Mission: Enigma), and it probably was responsible for convincing me that I could make a decent game myself. This was several years ago; at the time, I didn't realize just how innovative Code Red was. Now, looking back, I see how few games have managed to match its level of ambition.<br /><br />Delivering varied, clever gameplay, nice music, multiple endings, and a really, really neat Rube Goldberg device, Code Red triumphs over a set of lukewarm (but, unfortunately, heavily imitated) plotlines to offer a throughly entertaining experience.<br /><br />Every ZZT gamer has got to play this, really. It was probably responsible for a lot of what followed; it's definitely the single most influential ZZT game of all time.<br /><br />On the subject of graphics:<br /><br />Are the graphics outdated? Well, they were nice at the time, and we're talking ASCII here. I don't expect much, really, and Code Red is more than satisfactory on that count. I suppose I COULD pan Code Red for the graphics, but I would probably have to pan ZZT as well. I mean, it's A DECADE OLD!"☃"1056575184"☃"codered.zip"☃"5"☃"131.215.158.186"
"I should have reviewed this a long time ago."☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"CraNKGod is either the reincarnated spirit of Henry Dudeney or some kind of puzzle savant. How else can you explain Little Square Things?<br /><br />This puzzle game is at least as cleverly designed as most of the commercially released ones I've played, and better than most of them. The levels are varied and continually surprising, ranging from frantic action sequences to subtle planning exercises.<br /><br />But Crank isn't satisfied with offering just a few levels of quality gameplay. Using a branching-path system that allows the player to give the game who-knows-how-many different playthroughs, Crank makes absolutely certain that there's always something new to see here. And, of course, there are the bonus boss levels...<br /><br />And it's bug-free, as far as I can tell. No bugs. Did I mention that I didn't run into any bugs?<br /><br />NO BUGS.<br /><br />If you've ever tried to program a game of this scope, you know how _miraculous_ that is. Solid proof of the time Crank put into making this the best game it could possibly be.<br /><br />So, are there any flaws here? Well, a few levels have rather unrealistic expectations of the player's reflexes, but, thanks to the branching level system, those can be avoided. And the boss races are insanely, horribly difficult, but then, you'd expect them to be, wouldn't you? The plotline, well, is sketchy, but there's more than enough there for a puzzle game, definitely.

I jumped out of my seat, tipped the chair over, and got a nasty bruise. And I ignored the bruise, turned BJ around, and quickly disposed of the offending guard.<br /><br />How could you do that in ZZT?<br /><br />Well, having an engine that hides rooms from you until you open them was a VERY GOOD START.<br /><br />Making simple, neatly programmed, addictive, and replayable gameplay pretty much did the rest. This is a shooter with some nice features, and it doesn't pretend to be anything more. And I like it. Still no plot, though, but I don't really expect a plot here.

"good for 5 or so minutes, a little more"☃"Max Gene"☃"shrum3@juno.com"☃"This game isn't very great, even if you do like it's type. Like the first review will tell you, it's possible to stay alive forever without the restaurant, as the fridge is stocked infinitely. Therefore, you can cook food while eating snacks, which will raise your food level is record time. It gets boring really fast with how easy it is to get everything and stay alive, you can stay alive for free if you like, and constantly showering and working will get you lots of money. If there was a bigger range of things to do, and the items at home lost efficincy over time and use, this would be worth it. As it is now, it won't last very long.

"(A little) better than the original"☃"Max Gene"☃"shrum3@juno.com"☃"For those who don't know how this game works, it goes like this: You have comfort, fun, food, and health levels, and all but health go down constantly. If any hit the bottom, health goes down. The game is still on 2 screens, but there are a few new items, including Super Shower, candy, and so on. There is snow everywhere also, And a Christmas tree that serves no purpose (it appears an item is supposed to give it one, but I have found no such purpose). There is still only one job, but this expansion will give you about 5-10 minutes more play time. I was hoping for something more out of an expansion pack, as is this is a minor update. You don't need the original, thankfully, and for a 2 second download what do you have to lose? not much, unless you fiddle with this past it's time. You can get everything in it and stay alive indefinitely quite easily, but don't waste your time. I recommend you kill Smiley mercilessly after you get everything, then cackle at destroying his worthless life."☃"1058373456"☃"aslchrifix.zip"☃"1.5"☃"67.217.36.78"
"Nice. A definite must download."☃"Max Gene"☃"shrum3@juno.com"☃"Ever played one of those games where you have a cool spaceship, and you have to fight off huge, even cooler space ships? Yeah? Well this is one of them. I'm a fan, so here's how it works:<br />You are Captain Rodite, a mercenary who hasn't been on many missions, but neither you or your ship is a slouch (though the ship could use some upgrades), and soon become caught up in the Ekul rebellion against the empire. You get the chance to upgrade main shields at the beginning, and add on ammo (required, you start with zero), shielding (constructs 4 walls, stops you, needs gems but offers perfect protection) and hyperdrive (torches, makes the ship go faster. Not useful really). The games good part are the battles, which don't take long but are quite fun. You fight in a control center. Pushing left or right rotates the ship that way, up shoots, and down accesses the extras. Extras will raise shields, activate hyperdrive, or use the chain cannon, which comes after the talon mission and causes you to move some when shooting, useful for destroying small, mobile enemies. There are also 2 gun battles out of the ship. When you're done, download the sequel, which is much shorter but involves the story finishing final battle. Like I said, I'm a fan, and I hope that mercenary 3 comes out. This was too short since it was so good, I'm starved for more."☃"1058488589"☃"spaceftr.zip"☃"5"☃"67.217.143.56"

"Dear me."☃"double berry"☃"yotsua@aol.com"☃"I like this. I really really do. A cute, very well-detailed little adventure based around a chap named Arc, who must make it to work on time. The story isn't very well developed as of yet, but I can't blame Mr. Smith for that, as this is quite a short little demo.<br /><br />The graphics are very interesting. They're simplistic, yet also quite detailed at the same time, which works quite well. All the rooms are small, and centred in a blue box. I was making a game in this style, once. But now I can't. So poop. But in all seriousness, the technique is pulled off rather nicely, and since I'm never going to make a ZZT game again, cheers to Mr. Smith for pulling it off.<br /><br />There's little aesthetics, but what there is, is quite well done. The RPG battle engine is simplistic, but it works, and that's pretty much what matters. Battle graphics are very pretty, as well.<br /><br />The writing...however...is absolute shite. Mr. Smith's attempt to create a comedic RPG has been stifled by the fact that his sense of humour is nonexistant. And it really gets on my tits.<br /><br />Anyway, the game shows promise, keep it up, I suppose!"☃"1058531800"☃"MiniRPG.zip"☃"3.5"☃"172.189.72.18"

It said, &quot;St. Catherine's school has worked long and hard on this game, so don't edit it.&quot; (Excuse my paraphrasing) The game is really bad. Really.

"Interesting. . ."☃"Zephyr"☃☃"For a puzzle game, this is fairly decent. The graphics are pretty good, not excellent or anything, but they get the job done. I actually can't remember the plot-It was very vague. Of course, most puzzle games don't have a plot anyways! It has a fair variety of puzzles good for about an hour or two worth of gameplay. Interesting, there was no #endgame command at the end, so i wasn't sure if it was over. I sensed a bit of similarity between this and nightmare. . Tell me if you agree. <br /><br />I'd say it is a high 3.5 Not bad Zorkboy! better then a lot of the crap I've played recently. <br /><br />So, Download it, play through it, delete it, and download another game.

"...weird..."☃"Appliance"☃"Hodges5048@aol.com"☃"I downloaded this game beacause of the long, stupid title. However, the game was MUCH better than I expected. TDOGUOTWSOTB (long acronym) apparently was a 24hozzt game (from when? I dunno). Anyway, Odin wakes up one day and falls off Mount Olympous and has to climb back up before his telephone bill is due. <br /><br />The game's engine is very creative, expecially for a 24hozzt game. It's a side-scroller. You move left and right and shoot with the space bar. Up and Down let you climb/decend latters. whenever you shoot, It takes a second to charge back up. After about 3 level's though, the game ditches the engine and becomes more laid back and story-ish. The engine levels should have gone on for much longer. The story is very fun to play through, even if it's short.<br /><br />This is an okay game, mainly beacause of the side-scrolling parts. If your in dire need of something to do then wasting your time with TDOGUOTWSOTB may be worth a download."☃"1058884760"☃"Odin.zip"☃"2.5"☃"66.191.203.132"
"Quiet you...."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"First off, I'd like to say that Odin has one of the best names for a ZZT game. <br /><br />The game starts with an apropriate opening seqence that sets the mood quite well (apart from the inaccuracy about Odin living on top of Olympus.) From there it's on to the game where you guide Odin up a mountain in sort of a faux-platform style. You collect some fish for points and kill some things as you go. The enemies aren't difficult and the time limit is pointless, but the game is more about comedy than anything else and I believe it excells at that. A fun game that's worth taking a look at even if you only do it once."☃"1059025399"☃"Odin.zip"☃"4"☃"24.151.140.97"
"Wow!!!!"☃"Zanzara"☃☃"This is a game that I really liked.  Well it is not much of a game, it is just a movie you watch.  The movie is about Survivor.  Sixteen ZZTers (I think) are on an island on a show just like Survivor.  Tim Sweeney is the host.  The movie starts with the two tribes being seperated.  The tribes go to their seperate beaches and start making shelters.  Each character has a different personality (just like the show!).  Some are lazy, some are leaders, some help out, some sit by themselves, etc.  There is even individual interviews with the members of each tribe just like the show!  The movie goes on with an imunity challange and eventually goes on to tribal council where the losing tribe votes someone out (I won't say who).  Some people may not like this game as you don't do anything except watch, but it is definity worth the minute (if that)to download and the twenty to watch.  By the way, the movie only shows the first 3 days.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Kind of exciting<br />-Respectable graphics<br />-Creative<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Uses real peoples' names<br />-Long<br />-Only the first tribal council<br /><br />Good job Ringworm!!!!

"When old school and new school collide. ."☃"Zephyr"☃☃"   This game is very interesting. Interesting, because it has some pretty good original progaramming, along with some old-school programming, like pre-porgrammed enemies. So, you have a game with STK and neat objects, along with slime, blink walls, and bears (Oh My!). <br />   Liver's art seems to have improved since the last version-maybe he got some tips from commodore. . <br />  As far as action goes, the gameplay is a little better than average. Not too much though, because of the amount of pre-programmed enemies. (Those days are over Liver.) It is a lot better than the gameplay in most of the action games out there though. . <br />   Music, well, there really wasn't much of that. At least I don't remember much of anything. <br />   Overall, Liver has definitely has imporved concerning his programming skills.

"Pure Evil"☃"Zephyr"☃"drummermlw@msn.com"☃"This is possibly one of the most disturbingly evil zzt games I've played. Being a dungeon crawl, half of the objects on ths screen are dead corpse, and upon being touched give you items. Anthony however, does not leave it at that. He goes into detail and describes the corpes, whether they are ripped into shreds or whatever. Corpses are not the only Objects you run into however. You also meet up with other, Example: A lady screaming with a strait jacket. You take it off her and her organs fall out. eww. If this stuff doesn't make you sick, I'd reccomend this game- It has pretty good graphics and programming.

Your character can not stop moving at all, bumping into anything will kill you, and you have to shoot the goal to leave the level. It would have been a lot better with levels that were more thought out. As it stands there were 25 levels with no learing curve. There are no new challenges added, even though there are attempts to incorperate more dynamic features, it turns out you can beat them with the same tactics. Not to say the game is easier because of this. Not being able to save is annoying too and could have been avoided with little modification of the original engine. <br /><br />All these negatives aside, I enjoyed the game far more than it annoyed me.

The devil is in the details here; a simple set of tools has to be used, so that the gameplay can be picked up, but the thing can't get too repetitive.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />Well, there is a storyline here. It's a silly one, and is appropriately simple, but it adds a bit to the game. Furthermore, there was one really good joke, which is one more than I expected. This isn't Grim Fandango; this is The Incredible Machine, and any story is a bonus.<br /><br />Music:<br /><br />What? No brilliant musical score in a WiL game? I don't think anybody cares, actually.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />The player puts down special pieces on the board that redirect a little ball. Simple enough in theory, but it gets tricky when gravity gets reversed, or the ball sticks to the walls... or the thing just keeps falling into pits.<br /><br />It's fun, really, and that's all I can say. It gets a bit repetitive when the game drags out to the sixtieth level or so, but an effort is made to keep things fresh and ramp up the difficulty.<br /><br />Graphics:<br /><br />Workmanlike; anything complicated would get in the way of the engine, actually.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This one's worth a download. It was ignored in its time, so a lot of you have some catching up to do. I don't expect many people will play all of the levels (a branching system, like that of Little Square Things, would have worked better), but it's good to know they're there."☃"1064047296"☃"pipe-99.zip"☃"4.5"☃"131.215.158.186"

I didn't let it throw me off.<br /><br />I open up the game in ZZT, and title screen wasn't half bad, and neither were the graphics in the first 3 boards.

"No."☃"Zephyr"☃"drummermlw@msn.com"☃"   This game looked innocent enough when I downloaded it and loaded it in ZZT. Then, the intro started. . <br /><br />  I am really starting to believe that 96% of all ZZTers are illiterate after playing so many games. This was a prime example. The intro went something like this:                                     &quot;There was a magical king who had two sons there names were matt and carl Matt was good and had good spells and did good things like repairing the hole in the ozone layer! Carl was the other son evil and had evil powers and did evil things like put the hole in the ozone layer! One day Carl killed his dad and kicked Matt out of the castle and set up a wall so poeple couldnt get in the wall and it was a magical wall, so not even people with magic could get in the wall, until the good wizard came and then Carl remembered Matt. <br /><br />AND ON AND ON AND ON!!!!!<br /><br />Keep in mind, that was what, Three sentences?!<br /><br />So, I pressed &quot;P&quot; anyways, hoping that maybe the game would still be &quot;ok.&quot; I found bugs. Lots of Bugs. Lots And Lots of bugs. Sure the first few boards had pretty good graphics, And also had a SHOCKING resemblence to Warlord's Temple. So, I couldn't get in the cave without reprogramming an object to set a flag. Nevertheless,  I fixed it and went in the cave. MORE BUGS! Obviously, He doesn't understand transporters. The puzzle was impossible without ZAP. I made it through, (ungh) and went to the next board. Well, I tried, but the boards weren't lined up. I went thru editor and put myself on the next board.<br /><br /> A slider Puzzle! Yay! ungh. I got the end of the puzzle, just for an object to say, &quot;You didn't get enoufu Gmeas and Hot lavas fell down frum the roof and fell on you and you died.&quot; #endgame. <br /><br />I hate this game<br /><br />Next board had a clever object transporter puzzle, which would have been impressive if it didn't have bugs that ruined it. I beat it, Using ZAP, and went to the next board. PROBLEM! The board link was off and just sent you to the other side of the same board. MORON! <br /><br />I stopped in frusturation about here. <br /><br />So, I don't know what the guy above me is talking about.

"foxes use tampons ahahhaha"☃"MadTom"☃"madtom@comic.com"☃"(And before you ask, I'd intended to review this &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; I saw his LJ post begging for it. Warning, spoilers galore.)<br /><br />Zenith's first full ZZT game in three years is a full-blown triumph, a graphical masterpiece with original characters, an intriguing storyline, a cohesive, well-developed and depicted setting ... and the gameplay isn't half bad, either.<br /><br />&lt;i&gt;Frost 1: Power&lt;/i&gt; is a cinema game based on characters that Zenith has apparently been brooding on for a long time, perhaps years. Some of you might recognise, for example, the character Henna in prototype form from his art compilation &lt;i&gt;UltraWack&lt;/i&gt;, which was released way, way back when your grandfather was learning about STK, and, much more recently, from the infamous KrackeNadir art journal.<br /><br />The graphics are the game's main strength, which is not really surprising for a self-confessed cinema game, and, at the risk of sounding like I'm exaggerating (I'm not), I've never actually seen anything quite like it, particularly the art boards. Light and shadow are used very effectively, and the attention to detail is pretty astonishing. Zenith's trademark skylines, such as the purple-grey sky of the first 'teaser' board of the game involving a character named Set, are used to full effect, including consistency with descriptions of weather ... he said it was overcast, and he meant it!<br /><br />The gameplay, when you finally reach it after the marathon introduction, is simple; Penny Sha&iuml;well, upon being exiled from her homeland of Gian, is on her way to Alsace, walking through forest and swampland, and using the sword given to her by her mother to KILL things in the process. She faces such feared opponents as polliwogs and bloodflies, and, of course, the everpresent zombie muttering such intimidating threats as &quot;rrrr brains&quot;, and the task of finding the mysterious swamp witch Henna, whose unfortunately wounded pet is blocking the bridge to Alsace. All very simple, but rather nice. In fact, the only thing that &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; turned me off about the gameplay was the duplicator reproducing the enemies, though that's admittedly long been a pet peeve of mine.<br /><br />In spite of the potentially morose atmosphere of latter parts of the game, Zenith keeps a reasonably light perspective with occasional interjections such as &quot;stumpy is speshul :(&quot;, swearwords, and &quot;say goodbye to gian 4eva&quot;. Which is just as well, otherwise the game might have collapsed under its own (considerable) weight. The dialogue generally flows freely and realistically; there's no pretentious, droning, Final Fantasy-type crap here.<br /><br />The music, comprised of a mere two pieces, is my own, so I'd best ignore that ... and yes, Zenith, I saw my goddamned &lt;:) smiley on the squid board. I CONSIDERED PINGING YOU A POINT JUST FOR THAT I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW, SQUIRREL BOY<br /><br />All in all, &lt;i&gt;Frost 1: Power&lt;/i&gt; is a tour-de-force of, in my mind, unparalleled ZZT artwork set to a well-thought-out storyline, with a level of gameplay acceptable to a cinema game, interesting characters, and pretty damn good writing. Even if it was made by a guy who, according to Flaming O, looks like John Denver.<br /><br />Download it and play it now, since I've pretty much spoiled the whole damned thing for you!

"Hogan's (a) Hero!"☃"dapper gent"☃"yotsua@aol.com"☃"Micr0wave has made a triumphant return with his first ZZT game in seven years: Hoganeater. The all-star cast (featuring Boothe Howard, Smiley Burnette, Mr. T, and last but most definitley not least, Bob Crane as Robert &quot;Hulk&quot; Hogan) pull off an amazing performance that will send you reeling.<br /><br />You take on the role of Hogan. The digital comic opens in a ring of lies: The UN. A heated arguement has started between Hogan and Mr. T, over T's unorthodox practice of using UN planes to fly in autographed baseballs. Just when Hogan was beginning to win, T lobs a baseball, signed by baseball legend Rolly Fingers, into the ribcage of Hogan.<br /><br />Robert was infuriated; what's a nigger doing in the UN, anyway? Hogan drives to Hot Pepper Hill, to confront his boss (Smiley Burnette). It was all a setup: Hogan is tied down and shaved, execution style. Left for dead in a laundry bag on the side of the highway, Hogan is found by Boothe Howard, who gives him hair implants, and the ability to vomit bubbles at his foes. Hogan bursts out of the doctor's office, and makes his way back to Hot Pepper Hill, to face his old Boss, with a mouthful of bubbles. Will Hogan succeed? With your ingenuity, maybe!<br /><br />The graphics are astounding. There's a beautifully detailed picture of Bob Crane wearing a towel on the title screen. The locations look great, too, as they were all filmed and photographed ON LOCATION! Micr0wave cut no corners here.<br /><br />The sound is a mixed bag. The dialogue is absolutely fantastic: audible, clear, and very well acted. The musical score, performed by grammy-winning orchestra &quot;The Pee Wee Johnnies&quot;, leaves a bit to be desired from. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not as good as what we've come to expect of them. The title screen theme song, however, really shines.<br /><br />Gameplay is your standard digital comic faire, but it's not without its excitement! Between all that 'look'ing and 'think'ing, there's many a shoot (Barf?) out with the bad guys! Some are quite challenging, but nothing your typical shoot-`em-up player can't handle!<br /><br />Great graphics? An all-star cast? Exciting action sequences? A cameo/tap-dancing scene by Jeremy &quot;Be Anal&quot; Beanal? Hoganeater has it all.<br /><br />Good job, Micr0wave.

Basically you collect gems as in a large room as monsters (granted they are not pre-programmed monsters) are duplicated in hordes. When you get all the gems, you go to the next level. All the levels are the same large room. All the monsters seem pretty much the same. The last level has you collecting black gems on a black backdrop, sorry, no dice.

"So close."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"This has the makings of a decent game. It's buggy, as reported by the author who I think is retiring :( <br /><br />Basically there are a few levels where you fight loads of soldiers with a bullet-sword engine. It's rather frantic and could have been cooler if just a few features were added. <br /><br />Suggestions: The level menu is neat looking but abstract and removes from the feeling of the game. A world map with levels (some you would have to fight to get at) would have been better. <br /><br />Also multiple board levels would have been cool. Three would have been enough a level, like sieging a castle, there'd be the field, north of that the moat, and then the castle.<br /><br />The graphics are simple but add to the games arcade feeling and are never annoying. The difficulty setting is apreciated but you should set it at the menu, and instead of weapons, it should have been classes. A fighter would have a sword and 200 health points, an archer would have a bow, and 100 health points, and so on.<br /><br />It was fun, until it bugged out. Then I had to put it away because a game so close to being really good is sort of depressing. <br /><br /> "☃"1063832695"☃"warrior.zip"☃"3.5"☃"24.151.140.97"
"Much, much less than the sum of its parts"☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"SPOILERS BELOW!<br /><br />So, I'm looking at the top scores box, and I see that this game, Death Gate, got perfect scores from three reviewers. Now, three different opinions, all written up in reviews over three sentences long, mean something. Also, I notice that Zenith is in the credits. As is WiL. As is Jacob Hammond. As is Hercules. I don't know how this could fail.<br /><br />I download Death Gate and start it up; it opens well. A bunch of people are sitting around, plotting to destroy the world. They then destroy it. Nifty.<br /><br />It's pulled from the Death Gate game, of course, which was in turn based upon a series of fantasy novels, but hey, steal from the best, right? As long as they credit the original authors somewhere... yes, there they are. Legend is mentioned at the very, very end of the game. <br /><br />The game is broken up into segments, each of which is written by a different author. This is probably a good thing; having too many people work on the same scenes is a quick way to ruin a game, and probably quite a few friendships. I don't know; I've never tried that.<br /><br />Wow. Why didn't I get around to playing this earlier?<br /><br />Answer: It lacks either compelling gameplay or a well-told story. The writing is weak. The thing just doesn't stick together as a whole.<br /><br />I wasn't missing much.<br /><br />The first bad sign was the text at the bottom of the screen. It wouldn't have been a mortal sin, I think, if it had been well-written. Sadly, it was an ungrammatical mush of the game's fantasy jargon and Big Pronouncements. There were some attempts to give unique characters to the people in the game, but only the author cameos actually had real voices. I don't know; I guess that's what happens when you write yourself.<br /><br />Oh, yes, the second bad sign was the author cameos. See, in order to put the pieces of the world back together, the player has to go to different realms and bring back the game authors. So, first the game sets up an elaborate fantasy premise, which it repeats at great length whenever possible, and then it tears down any suspension of disbelief. I don't know; is this meant to be cute, or clever, or just wink-wink-nudge-nudge in-joking?<br /><br />In order to review Death Gate, I'm going to have to look at each of its sections separately, though, as each has its own personality. Even if Death Gate's dialogue often strikes the same few notes of exposition over and over, it doesn't repeat itself here. The segments are quite clearly distinct.<br /><br />Hercules' segment:<br /><br />This one begins with Lord Xar, your character's exposition dispenser, doing what he does best: dispensing exposition. He drones for a bit, and Hercules, who just a few seconds before was asking himself questions about the possibility of life in the other realms, listens politely to the spiel. Of course, this seemed repetitive to me, but I don't know.<br /><br />This is probably the most interesting thing in this segment. The rest of it consists of the player walking around HercLand, talking to a few token NPCs, fetching an item, and answering a pop quiz. On ZZT.<br /><br />Now, I don't know why people include ZZT quizzes in ZZT games. First of all, it breaks the fourth wall so thoroughly that you just can't repair it again. Secondly, it's not fun. If you know the answers, you know them, and it's a piece of cake. If you don't, there's no real way to deduce them. You just keep trying again and again until you're through with the damned thing. And, of course, they become harder with time.<br /><br />On the bright side, this one doesn't kill you if you make a mistake. You just have to start over. This alone suggests the existence of a merciful God. I don't know; it seems a lot better than the Prime Mover argument.<br /><br />Summary of HercLand: Not fun. Not interesting. No compelling characters. No real reason to keep going. Dull. I don't know; there might be something I'm missing.<br /><br />Jacob Hammond's segment:<br /><br />This one's short and bizarre. The player does a nonsensical fetch-and-carry, solves a really, really simple puzzle, and, well, that's it. It feels sort of... dashed off. On the bright side, this one doesn't take itself too seriously.<br /><br />Summary of Jacob Hammond's bit: Silly. Quickly over with.<br /><br />Zenith Nadir's segment:<br /><br />What's this? Actual gameplay? A throwaway joke opening? Two diverging paths through an action segment? Okay, we've got a game, now.<br /><br />That game begins with Simon, continues with Sokoban, putters along through a tricky, but generically Nadir-y, RPG/action segment, and ends with a standard action battle. Nothing original, I think, but what they hey. There's an effort here, and it doesn't exactly take itself seriously. Indiana Jones makes a brief cameo. I don't know; does that count as a joke, or just half a joke?<br /><br />Incidentally, am I the only one who thinks that those two paths through the temple are actually kind of similar? No? Darn.<br /><br />Summary of Zenith's segment: We've got (pedestrian, but well-executed) gameplay!<br /><br />WiL's segment:<br /><br />This was the most ambitious segment; it relies on the use of a timer and a sort of real-time adventure gameplay. In this case, &quot;adventure&quot; means &quot;running around frantically trying to talk to the right people at random before time runs out.&quot;<br /><br />It could have worked, but it's way, way too easy to put into an unwinnable state. Now, to be fair, WiL clearly means to do this, and does warn the player, but that doesn't make it good design. More open-endedness would have been a good thing. I don't know... maybe it would have just made things messier.<br /><br />There's another multiple-choice segment here. If you make a wrong choice at any point, which is easy to do, then you are left in Can't-Win Limbo. You'll also end up in Limbo if you aren't in the right place at the right time. You won't even know it immediately. You'll just flounder like a hopeless king who forgot to pick up the dead fish.<br /><br />Now, all of this would be sort of forgivable if the gameplay made any sense, but you're in a dreamworld of sorts, and that's WiL's favorite excuse for discontinuity. You just have to hope you're on the right boards when the timed events happen; logic won't get you far. I don't know; maybe I'm missing something.<br /><br />This is all a shame. This segment tries to raise Serious Ideas, and almost succeeds at some point; one of the key questions is whether or not we should cling to the comfort of old dreams. But the writing can't escape its pretension, and the attempt at connecting emotionally with the player was too much like a multiple-choice exam to really work. Sorry.<br /><br />Summary of WiL's segment: It tries.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I don't know. Am I missing anything? Oh, yes, the graphics. Very nice graphics, I think. I didn't notice them much, which meant that they were good. Bad ZZT graphics tend to stand out. The music was passable, such as it was, but it wasn't the sort of soundtrack I've come to expect from a game with WiL on board.<br /><br />I don't know. Perhaps I'm missing some central part of the appeal of the game. The dialogue certainly seemed to repeat itself quite a bit; Lord Xar chooses the climactic moments of the game to give a tedious full recap of all the preceding events, which is a bad habit of his. Maybe repetition = good fantasy writing. I don't know.<br /><br />I don't know. The gameplay was generally absent. The plot was good, but the story - that thing where characters react to events and drive the action - just wasn't there. What can I say? This is a game that didn't work for me, in spite of the great effort that obviously went into it. I don't know."☃"1064051920"☃"dgate.zip"☃"3"☃"131.215.158.186"
"Generic, but fun."☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"I played this quite a while ago, and remember being struck with two things.<br /><br />1) How generic it was. The story, the gameplay, and the characters didn't feel very new.<br /><br />2) How well-executed it was. Aside from a nasty problem in the opening, I didn't run into any severe bugs, and found that there was more than technical competence here. The graphics looked nice, the gameplay was neat, and, although I knew where the game was going, it was a fun ride.<br /><br />I'm not going to give a detailed critique of the plot and writing here, because you probably know what I'm going to say. It's passable. The gameplay is what holds this together, and there are some solid enough engines. The villain's forgettable, but so what?<br /><br />This is a game that does stuff correctly.

"Damn the return key!"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"Someone delete the above review plz.<br /><br />VOD is an interesting dungeon romp that allows you to play as one of 4 different characters. Each character his or her or its own style of attack. Technically the dungeon you go through is the same and the goal is the same (obtain the key to the Void of Destruction where untold riches and mystery are aboud), but each character takes a different path. <br /><br />Depending on who you are, you eventually have to fight some of the other characters to the tune of some final fantasy battle music. <br /><br />The game play is generic but fun and the story is cliche but engaging. The graphics are adaquate and never bad.<br /><br />A fun game that will keep you entertained enough to pay though with at least 2 of the characters, however you do get more of an insight as to the background story if you play as all four.<br />"☃"1064578184"☃"VOD.zip"☃"3.5"☃"138.253.214.8"
"Yeah.  Right.  Okay."☃"Ender"☃☃"When this game was posted, it was advertised as better than that of Dexter.  That is true.<br />Other games this is better than:<br />ADD<br />omg lol<br />School of ZZT<br />  I would name others, but I don't have time.  You want a review, and a review you shall have.  First off, this game is masterfully newbie-esque. Spelling errors and all caps on much of the text makes this game not only hard to follow, but impossible to interpret.<br />  Second, a bug prevents you from doing _anything_ in the second board. Once you correct it, you get a few boards of pre-programmed enemas, sorry, enemies.  These are painfully easy to beat, and the game ends in a nonsensical blur of spellng errors (probably intentional, but still), caps lock, and stupid &quot;Jokes&quot;.<br />  Oh, and Dex's art was one _HELL_ of a lot better.<br />ERR BAD COMMAND #FUCK OFF<br />P.S.<br />Sorry about comparing this game to ADD.<br />That was a little unfair.

☃"Danny Sussman"☃"streetfighter2dude@hotmail.com"☃"Super Street Fighter II was released in July of 1994 for the Sega Genesis. SSF II was developed and published by Capcom. SSF II marked the first appearances of four totally new character to the Street Fighter series: Cammy, Dee Jay, T. Hawk, and Fei Long were all brought into the mix. This game also brought about a new art style in the characters portraits, as well as a new announcer. <br /><br />Well, the graphics, despite being about seven years old, look amazing. The characters <br />themselves are huge and well animated. The game uses tons of color to enhance the feel <br />of the game, this is quite evident in Balrog?s Las Vegas level. The game also features <br />many more well animated backgrounds, Chun Li?s China background is full of bikers <br />speeding past and watching the action. The game?s animation is one of its most notable <br />qualities; each and every character has their own unique move set, along with it, the <br />characters each have their own specific animations for moves, with the exception Ryu and <br />Ken, who share quite a bit of animation. The animation in most of the moves is as smooth <br />as could be expected. <br /><br />The sound is a mixed bag of epic proportions. On one hand, the in-game music is <br />amazing, it always fits the level. Also, you couldn?t ask for bettter sound effects, namely <br />those used for kicks, punches, and special moves, they are all amazingly done, they fit <br />their actions perfectly. On the other hand, the announcing is weak, as are the voice quips <br />from some of the characters. Here?s the deal, the voice pitch has been raised considerably. <br />I mean, this announcer could do soprano, it?s just unbievably high. This high pitch really <br />doesn?t fit the game and actually manages to detract from the experience. <br /><br />The gameplay is standard Street Fighter fare, in other words, amazing. The game has <br />some of the smoothest gameplay of any fighting game ever. Moves can be pulled off <br />effortlessly, and battles can become frenetic affairs and wars of attrition. You go through <br />a set of opponents that changes depending on your character, if you win, you continue on, <br />if you lose, you have to option to contrine. Your goal, no matter what character you play <br />as, is to defeat the game?s main boss M. Bison, who is EVIL beyond all imagination. <br /><br />The control is among the finest ever in gaming. The Genesis' control pad fits this game <br />like a glove, the game?s default button layout is a perfect match to the arcade?s, making it <br />easy for arcade veterans to play without having to worry about the confituration. It?s also <br />very user-freindly, if you, for whatever reason, don?t like the default control scheme, you <br />can change it. The cotrol, no matter what the configuration, is rock-solid, it?s always very <br />responsive and never misses a beat. <br /><br />The game?s presentation.is the perfect mix of old-school Street Fighter with new-school <br />designs. The game employs brand new character art that have a very anime-esque look to <br />it that really fits the series well. This new art captures the ferocity in some of the <br />characters, most notably the man-beast Blanka, it also captures the elegant side of some <br />characters, most notably Cammy. <br /><br />The game?s difficutlty is adjustable. The difficulty scale goes from one star to ten, at one <br />star, the AI is as easy as could be, offense is minimal from the CPU-controlled characters, <br />on the higher levels though, you will be attacked from all sides, blocking will be imperitve <br />at this level. Quite frankly, the difficulty suits the game well, it?s progressive, which fits <br />fighting games very well, it allows beginners to test out their skills on lover-level <br />opponents, and it enables veteran players the ability to duke it out with challlenging <br />opposition. <br /><br />The game?s replay value is virtually limitless. There is always something new to learn in <br />the game; whether it?s a new move for you favorite character, or the timing of some <br />moves you?re having trouble with, you?re always left with something to do. <br /><br />The game is a dream to play on the Nomad. The small screen doesn't cause any problems during gameplay, nor does the blurring, best of all, the game's flawless control is intact. <br /><br />All in all, I love this game, it combines the best parts of the Street Fighter series. Some <br />may complain about the lack of a speed setting, but it really doesn?t affect the game much <br />for me, I prefer the slower pace anyway, I simply can?t keep up too well with it when it?s <br />going a million miles a minute like it does on higher turbo settings in Street Fighter II <br />Turbo, so I?m glad there?s no turbo setting in this game. <br /><br />---------------- <br />Score Rundown <br />----------------- <br /><br />Graphics- 10/10- Simply stunning. The super-smooth animation and minute background <br />details give this game a style all its own. <br />Sound- 7/10- The music fits each level, and character to a tee. The sound effects match <br />their actions perfectly. However, the new announcer's high pitched voice brings down the game's sound, he actually managaes to detract from the experience. <br />Gameplay-10/10- Tried-and-true Street Fighter gameplay. It?s fast and furious. Some <br />may moan and groan over the lack of speed settings, but it doesn?t bother me one bit. <br />Control-10/10- Simply perfect. The Genesis' controller works wonders for this game. <br />The default control configuration matches the arcade?s, but if you don?t like it, you can <br />configure it to your liking; either way, you?ll be getting smooth as silk, super responsive <br />control. <br />Presentation-10/10- The new art style helps emphasize the personas of some of the <br />characters. It?s also a very original style that fits the series. <br />Challenge- 10/10- You can control your destiny. If you want a nice, easy battle, you can <br />go to a lower difficulty, if you want a tough fight that will take you to your limits, go with <br />a higher setting, it?s all up to you. <br />Replay Value-10/10- There?s always something new to learn, whether it?s a new move, or <br />the timing of a move you already know, there?s always someting to do. <br />For Nomad Owners- This game is a must-buy. The graphics don't take a hit on the small screen, and blurring is nonexistant. The flawless control remains intact. <br />Overall-10/10- Pure, unadulterated Street Fighter bliss. The stunning graphics, amazing <br />sound and control, and classic gameplay make this game a must have.<br /><br /><br />Wait, STAR Fighter 2? What the hell is this crap?

☃☃☃"This is probably my favorite ZZT game ever. It combines the best elements of all ZZT games to create an instant classic. Also, note that it has virtually no swearing, (except for the frenchman saying demm, which I don't really count) thus appealing to a wider audience.<br /><br />Graphics are superb, particularly Zenith's, whose art I have a distinct taste for, though the other art is just as good.<br /><br />The music, at least, what I heard of it, because I sometimes turn the sound off, was great, except for the rap, which was intended to be annoying, and the Sartorio battle theme, for which I was very grateful to have an &quot;off switch.&quot;<br /><br />The gameplay was great, utilising a vast web of technology explained in the ZZT Encyclopedia. Personally, _I_ didn't find any of the action sequences annoying. And the puzzles! They were pure delight.<br /><br />Story was superb, and one of the best to come out in a looonnngg time.

When you first load the game into a computer, you will see the title screen which says........TITLE SCREEN! Of course this makes you think &quot;HEY! THIS GAME IS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESOME!&quot; and in the big bold white letters that says title screen, there are hidden sublimital messages saying, &quot;Press P if you want to have a good time.&quot; Which you will. The game is split into 3 part. One is a cinematic showing how a text box took control of a bunch of colored letters. Two is a trippy game where you run around touching door looking objects hoping for something to happen. While your there, you can stop by at the houses and talk to some people and worship a cactus. The 3rd part is the best part. The art section. Zandor has done a hell of a good job drawing the art work for this segment of the game. Yes this sounds like a good game with only one major flaw. While watching the cinematic about the text box, it gets glitchy at the end, which sortof hurt the game a little. But who cares! Its trippy! A game like this deserves a 5 out of 5. Nice job Zandor!

"Why the telescope?"☃"TTTPPP"☃"tttppp123@hotmail.com"☃"This game aims for horror and does surprisingly well.<br />When I first read the html 'readme' file (what happened to the txt file?) I thought a ZZT horror game wouldn't work, but by a brilliant combination of prosaic text and dark rooms (dark in colour, not the sort where you need torches) the author pulls off a scary feel to it.  Admittedly it's not the sort of thing you can manage with a film, but I was impressed.<br /><br />Other than that the game was quite simple - run around and touch a load of objects.  There were places where I had to consult the walkthrough as I was required to do something I'd already done again. (Even something like reading a book - maybe it didn't sink in the first time).  I couldn't manage to pick up the objects I expected to be able to, but other than that the game seemed quite bug free.<br /><br />The game was really short, and could have done with more puzzles, like places where you had to get an object to get into somewhere to get another object to...<br />The story though was well presented, and based on a great idea.  Without giving anything away, there was one line at the end which was along the lines of &quot;It worked then&quot; which raised a couple of completely unanswered questions for me, and there's a girl who doesn't seem to play any part in the game.<br /><br />Overall though it was well worth the download, and made entertaining playing."☃"1066081136"☃"blind.zip"☃"4"☃"131.111.8.96"

Seeing the creature, he knows that dr. Eggman (For me better known by his second name Robotnik) wants again to transform all creatures into robots.<br /><br />After playing the first level Sonic finds Dr Eggman which like any other evil person tells him about his plan, before escaping. He also tells that he has captured his friends Tails and Knuckles as part of his plan. <br /><br />In the next two levels, Sonic frees his two friends and decides it is time to go after Dr. Eggman<br /><br />At the end of the fourth level Sonic witnesses Dr. Eggman taking a chaos emerald, which gives him extra power. <br /><br />In the fifth and sixth level Sonic chases the scientist until he gets to his space station, where they will fight again. Sonic ruins the plans of dr Eggman, but the scentist will escape only to make up new plans. <br /><br />In the course of the game Sonic can find the chaos emeralds in the bonus levels. If sonic has collected all seven, he will transform into super sonic and the game continues so that sonic can finish off Dr. Eggman.<br /><br />The game is easy to play, but it is not too difficult to do. The game is separated by scenes which unravel the plot<br />The graphics are of good quality.<br />The plot is logical and almost flawless, and could be very well the basis of Sonic the Hedgehog 4<br />The programming is unfortunately not perfect. There are some bugs, (most of them in the last few levels), and there is one passage in the wrong color so that the player will get stuck when going through.<br />After playing this game, I started up the genesis and played Sonic 3 (Sonic &amp; Knuckles) for the comparison.

Choose your X-man (doesn't impact the game very much, I was disappointed with the limited character selection technology) and stop Magneto from carrying out another one of his cooky plans.<br /><br />Gameplay: Shoot your way through... even if your X-man doesn't have laser eyes or lightning bolts... also, gameplay was more linear than any other game I've played. Except maybe life of a player. You keep on walking to the right, then eventually you will go down and then to the right again.<br /><br />Programming: A lot of preprogrammed enemies, and a few object enemies. The bosses are very similar, however the first is much harder than the other two I managed to face before game over. The first was throwing many stars, then suddenly the author doesn't use stars anymore. Again, instability in the game making process. The programming must be efficiant... this game seems larger than the measily 9kb zipped.<br /><br />Considering this game was made years ago (At least that's what I can discern from the filesize) the game's score is being bumped up a bit."☃"1066261626"☃"xmen.zip"☃"1.5"☃"66.54.1.38"
"it evokes an evocative evocation, lol"☃"Ryan Ferneau"☃"rferneau@iastate.edu"☃"This is the game that was demoed in Evocation magazine #2, but with a few more boards.  I'm thinking this is set in the Star Trek universe, due to the amount of sci-fi crap inside your house/apartment and the number of holograms and -5 hp force fields outside your house/apartment.<br /><br />Anyway, you play as someone named Trip Head or Trish Ed or something like that, and your friend, a pie from the moon (green cheesecake?), invites you to play a hologram game in the halomatrix (shouldn't that be &quot;holomatrix&quot;?).  But first, you have to bravely ignore the drunken guy, bravely figure out that force fields hurt, and bravely perform a convenient series of events that allows you to kill a (holographic? I can never remember) donkey.<br /><br />Now, if you've watched Star Trek as much as I have, you should know that whenever anyone tries to have fun in the Holodeck, some freak comes along, locks everybody inside, and turns off the safety so it's like real life.  In this game, that freak is Tyrannous.  He kidnaps some chump named Scorch and forces you to band together with some other people who share the names of ZZTers to play a game of Robin Hood (hey, didn't this happen in Star Trek, too?).<br /><br />So you get a bit of information from some people with important-sounding names who teleport around for no reason, and then a bunch of people run off to an empty board and an archer shows up.  You can kill the archer if you remembered to grab the ammo two boards back.  Also, you can go two boards to the right to see some purple flowers (only one of which triggers a text box), a bird in a tree, and an unprogrammed yellow smiley named Hercules (the legendary hero?).  That's about it.<br /><br />There is a shocking number of empty boards in this game.  Only one unused board actually had something in it, but there was no real explanation of what it was.  Probably some brown cave or something."☃"1066538086"☃"hood.zip"☃"1"☃"129.186.74.120"

"Mystery Science ZZTheater 3000"☃"Dr. Forrester"☃"dr_forrester2001@yahoo.com"☃"Interactive MiSTings? What a great concept! This game proves that ZZT is an ideal concept for creating a MiSTing. As this is an treated as an episode of the show, I will write my review in Amazing Collasal Episode Guide format.<br /><br />The Game:<br />&quot;Godzilla vs. Planet X5&quot; is a boss battle game that throws you against a half dozen of the Godzilla movies most famous villians.  Obviously, you play as none other than, who else, Gamera<br /><br /><br />No, just kidding, it's Godzilla :)<br /><br />the plot seems to involve our main characters, &quot;PVT&quot; and &quot;SGT&quot; throwing Godzilla from boss to boss via the &quot;Godzilla Transport Devive&quot; in some effort to stop an invasion by aliens. Or something.  The author, Jpasc123, doesn't seem to do a very good job fleshing out the story.  After the battles are through, we are treated to several ZZT versions of the author's favorite scenes from the Godzilla series.  Only about a quarter of the games screens are interactive, the rest being simple cutscenes that have to relation to the game you just played (other than featuring Godzilla).  It's a bit like playing one map from Gettysburg, then getting to watch one hour from Gone With The Wind.  Horrible spelling, typos, and grammer abound, making the text seem almost Dr. Thinker like in quality.  The boards are decently designed, and better writing and more interactivity would have definately helped this game.<br /><br />Segment One:<br />Thanks to a black hole, Mike &amp; the 'bots find themselves transformed into ZZT characters.  Crow notes that he is now an accented lowercase E.  Pearl takes advantage of the situation by sending Mike &quot;Godzilla vs. Planet X5&quot; on the ships main navagational computer.<br /><br />[henceforth, all segments take place in the theater]<br /><br />Segment Two:<br />Gypsy informs everyone that the ship is on a collision course. Since the game is running on the main computer, gypsy can't turn the ship or stop.  Mike suggests using the &quot;#walk idle&quot; command, which the 'bots scoff at.<br /><br />Segment Three:<br />Mike's idea works better than expected.<br />&quot;When in Rome...&quot; notes Gypsy.<br /><br />Segment Four:<br />Outside the theater, Mike can't stop smiling (probably because he is a smiley face).  This angers Pearl, who promises to send something worse next time.<br /><br />The unknown author of this MiSTing did a very good job converted the original game to the MST3K format, and several riffs will have you laughging out loud.  The addition of &quot;touch&quot; jokes, for when the player tries to interact with Mike &amp; the 'bots works especially well.  Overall, I have to say that this game does an excellent job, but doesn't seem to nail it quite as well as either Aceland or Despair (which I'll try to review as well.)  So, only four star since those two eventually surpased this hilarious game, but starting the ZZT MiSTing idea earns it another half star."☃"1067270761"☃"mst3000.zip"☃"4.5"☃"198.85.71.19"

Unlike boulder-xod, there are many types of boulders, some which aggravate me to no end. Which is the real killer of puzzle games: difficulty.<br /><br />But, the author side-stepped difficulty and cussed at it. How so? The game operates on a pyramid.

"Aceland: The MiSTing"☃"Dr Forrester"☃"drforrester2001@yahoo.com"☃"The second (as far as I know) ZZT MiSTing released takes us back to the Joel Robinson era of the show, a good move in my opinion. Anyway, on to the Amazing Collasal Episode Guide format...<br /><br />The Game:<br />Prakash's &quot;Aceland&quot; is a fairly mediocre attempt at a ZZT game. It has a very basic &quot;save the kingdom from the evil tyrant&quot; plot, strung together with many boards suffering from &quot;i-gotta-fill-in-the-board&quot; syndrome. Basically , you must collect 5 keys, (note: actually objects, not really keys) four white and a yellow, to get to the tower of the evil mugerlock. The game actually holds together rather well, until the point in the game where your character gets the microwave weapon, essentially allowing you to kill every NPC in the game with only a touch or two. A gem generator in the bank makes money/health essentially unlimited, even if getting to it is supposed to be a secret. Also, the original version had a bug that prevented you from finishing the game, fixed for the purposes of this misting. And further still, the game has an annoying habit of holding your hand at times, removing almost all difficulty. Overall, Aceland is a dull, unoriginal ZZT game that the author must of thought was terribly witty. Unfortunately, it's mearly terrible.<br /><br />Segment One:<br />Joel &amp; the 'bots discuss ZZT, and possibly making their own game. Crow suggests one set on the Satellite Of Love, and Joel tells him it's been done.<br /><br />Invention Exchange:<br />Joel - Device for clearing a room full of monsters<br />Mads - Device which turns classic literature into bad ZZT games<br /><br />Dr. F decides to try his invention on Shakespeare's Macbeth, and tells Joel it should be ready by the time the experiment is over.<br /><br />Segement Two &amp; Three:<br />none<br /><br />Segment Four:<br />Joel does the classic &quot;tell me one good thing about Aceland, and i'll give you a RAM chip&quot; bit. Dr. F sends Joel the Macbeth game, and Joel deletes Tom's knowledge of Shakespeare for the time being. You then get to play through a rather silly dark board where you must murder the king. TV's Frank then recites a little from &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;, which the 'bots gleefully riff.<br /><br />Stinger:<br />howa bouta soma ammonitino<br /><br />Although the second ZZT MiSTing leaves out Joel &amp; the 'bots in the corner of the screen like in &quot;Godzilla&quot;, it is still my second favorite in the series. John W. Wells is our writer this time around, and he captures the characters prefectly. The riffers poke fun at the game's poor level design, ridiculous economic system (what with the infinte gems in the bank) and all points in between. The addition of the MST3K theme song overlayed on Aceland's original title screen is very nice.<br />Very, very funny. allthough &quot;Despair&quot; is still the better MiSTing if you ask me, it's only by a small margin. I'd give this game 4.75 stars if i could, but since a can't, i'll round it up to a 5 :)"☃"1067288608"☃"acelandm.zip"☃"0"☃"138.253.235.68"

The graphics are incredible the swamp graphics start eerily spooky and then with the nice blending totally give a wet swamp feeling. Zenith's trademark skylines peek in. And in the two boards (attack/reload &amp; Death cab for rosie)The skyline is extremely &quot;G00B&quot;. Frost has good details everywhere for example the fakes in the linking board to the swamp right before the swamp board the rocks and plants everywhere. Of course ever since Blue moons moon scenes and Dragon Woods Zenith's graphics were known. The music is well done by Master Composer MadTom. The sword engine was good and the enemies slight AI was good enough. The story while not being completely original was good enough and as MadTom said the slight interjections (HOORAY!, SHIFT YO ASS) prevented the story from being to serious but didnt make it Chickenwired.<br /><br />Programming 5/10 Uh.. yeah<br /><br />Graphics 11/10 Beyond anything i've seen in ZZT so far.<br /><br />M00SICK 10/10 Hi MadTom!<br /><br />Plot 8/10 Good<br /><br />Overall: 10/10 The programming could have more tricks like some in Chickenwire v1.8 (The smiley's diagonal blinkwall trick)and the plot could have more twists but overall a must play<br /><br />I EAGERLY AWAIT FROST 2 (&amp; 3?)!<br /><br />-ZZDevelin"☃"1067704321"☃"frost1.zip"☃"5"☃"216.84.80.197"

It does however suffer from being a 'first game'.<br />The author has obviously played other RPG's and thought &quot;Hey, I could do that&quot;, and was pretty much right.  There's nothing particularly clever with most RPG's, and after a few they can be more than tedious.  The battles in this game are *very* time consuming, and you always seem to have the same chance of suceeding (no matter what attack you choose).  Consequently I used two or three ?health's, so that I didn't have to restart.<br />The walk around bits are quite nice, and there is a small amount of exploration element to it.  My favourite line in the game is when first entering the caves and I was told to &quot;Be weary&quot; - an instruction I had little difficulty following.<br />I'm not sure what's going on with the plot - you kill god, you kill some ogres, etc but I don't think it added anything to the game."☃"1068291746"☃"1000pcorrect.zip"☃"0.5"☃"131.111.8.101"

"Simple indeed"☃"Ender"☃☃"It being seemingly fashionable to review this game, I would like to put in my 2 cents.  None of you know who I am, but anyway.  My review.<br /><br />To summarize: pre-FABULOUS!  I saw almost no objects whatsoever in this game.  Everything is prefab, not including, obviously, the stuff from STK.<br /><br />The games are: Avoid the stars, Run around the track, Run from the tigers, and run down the hallway lined with bears.  It is impossible to get any score higher than 3,360 on the latter, because the player can only move so fast.  <br /><br />Dos is such a great guy, I hate to give him this, but the game deserved it.  The only reason this game didn't get lss is that it IS mildly addictive."☃"1070594147"☃"SimpleGames.zip"☃"0"☃"67.73.162.86"
"Har har har."☃"Terryn"☃"terryn@jingoro.net"☃"So, out of curiosity, I loaded up this game to see how Nadir changed it (you can find it on the NES Quattro Adventure cart) and I was quite pleased!<br /><br />Firstly, the difficulty was FAR reduced.  Most of it I'm assuming was because of the limitations of ZZT itself; there's simply no way to keep the original three item shuffle inventory system in ZZT, and there's no way to restrict ZZT from allowing a savegame.  <br /><br />The pain of trying to pogo or crowbar underwater, as you'd have had to arranged your items offshore to where the snorkel was last or DEAD, is gone!  MAJOR POINTS<br /><br />Secondly, the game is actually prettier in this form.  zn knows how to make good ZZT graphics, pure and simple.<br /><br />Thirdly, the text is ...far less minimalistic.  VERY FEW things ever gave out any text (which made the obvious totem-pole puzzle far more difficult).<br /><br />Lastly, CAMEOS<br /><br />The mechanics of the game remained pretty much the same.  There was one or two almost negligible omissions (like having to have a plunger as well as dynamite to set off the blast).  The switch to overhead is just as good, if not better, than the original.<br /><br />The game itself?  Inventory, and fairly short but good.  Some scavenging thrown in as well.<br /><br />What I missed:  I'd have liked to have allowed Dizzy to kick at least one bug-eyed giant fly, or to WALK ON TOP OF THE CLOUDS LIKE ODIN =("☃"1070598010"☃"tidizz.zip"☃"5"☃"66.79.92.14"

"I have to think of another clever review title?"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"This game starts with a rather pretty title screen and a few well drawn introduction boards. However once you actually start playing the game, the graphics disappear.<br /><br />Blood Oath carries a decent storyline where you play the apprentice of a necromancer who disappeared long ago in search of immortality. You can apparently attain immortality by drinking the blood of the BIG BAD wyrm. Before he left you both made a &quot;blood oath&quot; that if he never came back, you would go and try an kill the wyrm yourself. So off you go, into the cave.<br /><br />The cave is a fairly large place. It's drawn simply, grey walls with a grey top to give it a little more of a 3-D feel. All in all though it is sparse on detail. Sure there are a lot of dead bodies, but most of them at just #Bind'ed to another object and give you a message like: &quot;A skeleton with a crushed head.&quot; <br /><br />There is little in the way of puzzles, but there are a few simple adventure style puzzles. The real meat of the game comes with the RPG battles. The battles are decent but nothing spectacular. They are randomised enough to give it less of a programmed feel, but in general, if you lose a battle, it's usually because you missed the health potion back a few screens. In this programmers opinion, without a level system or some sort of way to improve your characters, RPG battles are fairly pointless. Not being able to get past something because you are too weak is a key part of RPGs.<br /><br />The author attempts some dark dramatic writting that sometimes works, and sometimes feels like a bad movie script. The only redeemable quality of the writing is the actuall story itself. <br /><br />The graphics are on the weak side, excluding the nicely done opening cutscenes, and the gameplay is on the minimal side. Despite all of that it's still an enjoyable game with a decent story that won't take you too long to play. And even if you don't finish it, you won't quit the game pissed."☃"1070959227"☃"BLDOATH.zip"☃"3.5"☃"24.151.143.76"
"Sorry, but...."☃"Homz"☃"sherlock_homz@hotmail.com"☃"Okay, that will be the last idiotic review of this simple game I'm tolerating before I review it.<br /><br />These fools who review games like idiot nebies, saying stupid things like &quot;LOL THIS GMAE Ro&gt;&lt;oRS!!!!!111!!!&quot; practically. While I respect these people and Dr. Dos otherwise, it disturbs me to see these reviews go by unchecked from z2 authorities, in particular Mooseka's review, which is totally beside the point of the game. Mooseka's review is entirely erroneous and false. Quite to the contrary, this game is not the best ever, it's graphics are very minimal, and it is not a touching story about a boy dying from cancer.<br /><br />This is a pre-fabricated arcade. The gameplay is not great, nor is the game of epic proportions. In this game you will find such obviously creative ideas as dodging stars for as long as possible, killing tigers as fast as possible while more spawn, and avoiding bears with only ten health. This is not a fountain of new ideas. For a few hours, it may be worthing wasting your time on, but eventually, you will find it wasting away on your hard drive in disuse. I also deeply noticed the extremely minimal and lacking title screen, a virtue that Dos seems to excel in. I would reccomend that you exercise a little more creativity in this area. It is one of the most important aspects of a game. Minimal text screens can be overused.<br /><br />Programming: .5<br />Gameplay: .5<br />Music: 0<br />Story: 0<br />Graphics: 0<br /><br />Thus arriving at an overall score of 1.<br /><br />Otherwise, your ZZTV channel was great, and Nightmare Island, as well as the rest of your projects show great promise.

In one arena-style game, the lions were allowed to move out of the way of the duplicators. In others you are forced to cinually press enter while you move up to the top of the screen and use ?+zap to get your way past the sensor object, because there is noway in hell any player is going to attempt to kill those ruffians with the constant dialog boxes appearing.<br /><br />And if the author does release the Troggdor (sp?) minigame, it's personal.<br /><br />Not as bad as School ZZT, the only reason to download is to make yourself feel better about your own ZZTing ability... no matter who you are.<br /><br />Oh, and if you do play, turn your monitor brightness down.

"Close, but not too close."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"This game is proof that a ZZTer can have a  great idea yet because of the ZZTer's limited skillz, can not make the game to it's full potential.<br /><br />Card Prime is a first in ZZT, a game that revolves around battleing using magical cards ala Magic: TG or other such games. Unfourtunatlely the differance between Magic and Card Prime is that in Magic, reltively weak card still have use. In Card Prime, once you get the amazing super powerful cards, that's all you use. Sort of like the last battle in Chrono Trigger where all you do is use one triple tech over and over, use a mega-elixer, then rinse and repeat.<br /><br />The concept is good, however the story to go with the concept is weak. It's obvious that it would be hard to give this game much more scope than it has, what with the KB limitations, but a more detailed background story, and perhaps a central character you can feel for, would help.<br /><br />Another thing that removes enjoyment from the game is the graphics. Better than some games, but not many. Simple terrains, lack of detail, and less than interesting battle sequences. The same engine would have worked just as well with pictures of the fighters like in Wartorn.<br /><br />Still, this engine is certainly somethign to build on. With an original concept, it's obvious that appliance took a lot of time to make this because it was something he wanted to show he could do. I think it's a idea, but sadly a less than good game.

The gameplay varies greatly, but it always manages to entertain.<br /><br />Sound: Wasn't much music, though there are short melodies throughout the game that add to the experience.<br /><br />Graphics: Graphics are simple, but good.

What needs to be worked on? Everything. Let me try an explain. First thing first, when you start a new board, immedietly delete the boarder, don't just change it to another colour, get rid of it. Second, do not use the premade enemies, lions, tigers, etc. Also, stars are not fun at all. Secondly, play some other zzt games! look through the archive and look at games with scores of 75% or higher. Finally, think of a story. Something that involves people with goals and emotions. Not just, &quot;Get the thing!&quot; or &quot;Save the girl!&quot; and so on. anyways.<br /><br />My other point is to the above idiot: &quot;not important&quot;. If you are going to write reviews about games you think are bad, please write reviews that try to contain more intelligence than the game itself rather than totally bashing the game. Try injecting some words of wisdom or encouragement. "☃"1071604154"☃"strangecity.zip"☃"0"☃"24.151.143.76"

"Hot damn."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"A great game that takes you to some really fantastic and interesting places is only undermined by laspes in gameplay.<br /><br />One can not complain about the graphics, coolzx is (in this humble zzter's opinion)  one of the best, if not the best, graphical artist the game has ever seen. But like other masters of aesthetics (WiL) the game itself falters in key places. The sword fight is intensly annoying and the final battle is absurd. You're only allowed to move left and right but there is an object that shoots horizontally at you. The actual dungeon portions of the game are fairly weak in some places, but a lot stronger in others. The future area, while awesome looking, is extremely  difficult in comparison to the rest of the game. The RPG battles are what saves the game with excellently drawn enemies and a fairly simple but never annoying battle system. The simplicity of the battle system is excuseable what with the amount of other features in the game, but had the actual game been better, we would not have needed the RPG battles.<br /><br />The music is nothing special but works. Better than I could do, but not better than the works of WiL or Madtom.<br /><br />The story is interesting and rather fun, but the writing is weak with the dialoge between characters simple and formulaic.  The ending is cluttered and forced, with a disapointing climax to boot.<br /><br />I'm going to get a lot of flak for this score but mainly it's to balance the two perfect fives that I don't think this game deserves.

"Unintelligent gaming at its best"☃"Homz"☃"sherlock_homz@hotmail.com"☃"From the very beginning, this game dies to be deleted off of your hard drive. The only part of this game that need be looked at to understand what the game will be like is the title screen, which gets this fine game off to an even more excellent start. Here we get a taste of the goodness to come by merit that PKMNfan tells us to look at the screen upside-down, because his head is stuck that way, apparently, and that?s that way he drew the title screen. Also, from the very beginning, we see that PKMNfan is so smart to give us his other nickname ha&gt;&lt;0r the 1337. It also states that PKMNfan _laboured_ over this game, doing a total of THREE HOURS. Can you believe it? He worked _SO_ hard on it.<br /><br />Now, all we have to do is press ?P? to be treated to a wonderous display of the best in crap newbie games. The minigames are very poor, consisting of little else than pre-fabricated enemies and other stuff typical of crap newbies like PKMN. Strangely enough, however, PKMNfan was actually smart enough to include some _very_ handy little tricks that he ripped off of the Encyclopedia. How he managed this I don?t know and don?t care. Obviously, he needs to take a look at some quality ZZT games such as the Featured Games and the ones mentioned in the z2 Help articles, acessible from the menu bar at the top of the page. I really suggest putting some good work into your games next time, PKMNfan, before you are permanently labeled a crap newbie.<br /><br />Graphics: While PKMNfan boasts about having ?TONS OF STK GRAPHICS!!!!1111,? I see nothing worth giving any recognition to. The graphics are pure, unadulterated waste products. There is nothing worth seeing, here. Please define graphics. Strangely enough, he used the Zenith Tool Kit. Even the graphics in the toolkit are better than anything seen in the game. And generally, it?s a good idea to avoid the blinkers.<br /><br />Gameplay: If walking across an empty board to get to the other passage excites you, YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME. For those of us who prefer intelligent gaming, stay away.<br /><br />Sound: None<br /><br />Programming: Poor to little. The cool stuff section had some interesting things that had already been discovered, but how PKMNfan found them out beats me.<br /><br />Story: As the Minigame Collection had none, I will rate the accompanying game, Alchemy, on this. Poor. No good.<br /><br />Overall: The Minigame Collection was bad enough, but Alchemy being included made a bad download worse. Don?t waste your time. On a side note, I would add that this game is likely inspired by ?Simple Games for Simple Minds? and is a good example of why games like that should be carefully released, the reason being that newbies look at it and say ?Oh that?s so cool and everyone likes it I shall now make a better one !!!!1!111!.? If games like this continue to be released, we are going to need to start seperating, or even deleting completely games like this from the archive, to make room for the games that are actually worthwhile. Surely you can do better than this, PKMNFan?<br />"☃"1071785128"☃"Minigamz.zip"☃"0"☃"66.38.200.194"
"The Rose"☃"Homz"☃"sherlock_homz@hotmail.com"☃"The Rose is a strangely moving piece of art, put together with the style and flair that is typical of such a ZZT master as WiL.<br /><br />This cinema concerns WiL and his ex-friend Patrick, and the growing animosity between them when Patrick decides that he would rather spend time making out with his girlfriend than playing Super Smash Bros. with WiL and two other friends. After a prelude that outlines this tragic turn of events, you, Ian, are introduced. You are actually the famed superhero Kid Action. After a fun night of doing your job, you go to school the next morning, when WiL asks to speak with you for a moment before the bell rings, thereby enmeshing you in this bitter feud.<br /><br />The graphics are superb, evoking just the right feelings to suit the occasion, be it the dim alley, Joey's sparse house, or the sky lit with fire. The music sets the mood perfectly with its beauty, and brooding sense of sorrow, and there is just enough music to fully round out and complement the game. The programming is always good, and at two places impressive, those being the battle engine, and leaving the house. The gameplay is what you would expect from interactive cinema, for the most part, except, perhaps, a little less interactiveness than some might desire, but, for the story, it suits perfectly. The story, of course, is what moves the game along, and is fittingly marvellous. It is just serious enough, yet still has those little touches of WiL absurdity, humour, and strangeness, yet these seem perfectly suited, somehow, fitting right in with every thing else, and a beautiful, if slightly inconclusive ending that is very moving.<br /><br />Overall, this is an almost flawless cinema, which every ZZTer should experience and treasure. Yes, it has its strange parts, but they seem to fit in with the usual seriousness of the story. As far as I understand, the story was based on a dream that WiL had, so this is fairly standard dreamish material, though perfectly suited to ZZT. It is indeed a necessary download, and one of the best of its genre."☃"1071785575"☃"therose.zip"☃"4.5"☃"66.38.200.194"
"Not too great, but not the worst of the worst"☃"Homz"☃"sherlock_homz@hotmail.com"☃"This game is, indeed, rather strange. It consists of several ?levels? strewn together, each consisting mainly of avoiding enemies or bullets as you only have ten health.<br /><br />Story: While the game could have at least had some form of story to explain what is going on, it doesn?t.<br /><br />Graphics: The graphics, while still rather poor, are a definite improvement over Minigame Collection, Sam?s first game, and are at least don?t hurt too much to look at, except for the invisible walls maze. For one, the maze consists of yellow walls, which are generally hated with a passion by ZZTers worldwide. Second, instead of a nice fade in, fade out effect to reveal them, they immediately turned into normals, nearly giving me a seizure. Try it for yourself, you?ll see what I mean. They really could use a fair bit of touching up. <br /><br />Programming: Decent, Sam obviously knows how to program, but he needs to work on the other aspects for a truly good game. 1<br /><br />Music: None.<br /><br />Gameplay: It wasn?t bad, but it really wasn?t that fun. .5<br /><br />My advice to Sam Vinci: First of all, you locked your game. This is generally not a good idea, and is something I haven?t seen for a while. If you lock a game, it takes away one of your flags, pushing further limits on your game that would otherwise be unnessecary. <br /><br />This and your other games could really use some work. Play some quality games, like ESP, Respite, anything by Zenith Nadir, and you?ll see what I mean. Take a look at the featured games and read the reviews, no matter how long they may be. Don?t just play them, study them. Look at what it is that makes them so great. Compare them with your games, and ask yourself how you can improve, but don?t expect to draw like Nadir right away. Quality work takes practice. If you don?t like how a particular board looks, redo it. It may take a little more time and effort, but if it earns you the recognition and respect of your fellow ZZTers, it is worth it. And most importantly of all, if you have any problems, register at the z2 forums and ask for help. After all, that?s what they?re there for!<br />"☃"1071785767"☃"strangecity.zip"☃"0.5"☃"66.38.200.194"

The game is short, but the story is decent and the visuals are amazing (especially for a 24-hour game).<br />Not too hard, but I prefer games that I can win without cheating or ripping my hair out, so it was fine for me.

Anarchy has packaged together a few boards of semi-nice art, a hefty amount of senseless endgames, and positively no gameplay whatsoever to make what he calls an ?adventure.? I don't think so. The insanity in this game isn?t even funny, just stupid. I gave Anarchy a chance, I was willing to tell myself that he had prospect, and just to expect he would use it. Wrong. Anarchy has, for the most part, consistently misused his talent on senseless time-wasters with no value or fun, and I have tired of it.<br /><br />Graphics: Fairly good.<br /><br />Music: None.<br /><br />Gameplay: Consists mainly of wandering around on all of three boards while getting unneeded endgame messages for no particular reason other than that Anarchy is annoying and decided to throw them in.<br /><br />Story: Nonexistent. <br /><br />Programming: Nothing that hasn?t been done before. <br /><br />Some people may say that it at least deserves a 1, but I dissent from this. If Anarchy continues to put his efforts into idiotic wastes of time like this, I have no choice but to continually reward him with zero?s. If you really took a hint from Zenith Nadir, who you say is your favorite ZZTer, your games would be a whole lot better.

"What this game deserves"☃"Caspar"☃☃"I don't know how long this game has been here, but I think it deserves a review.<br /><br />Battle Tech is divided in four part, so I'll give it four small reviews.<br /><br />Part 1: This is a movie that tells you the beginning of the story. The graphics are very good.<br /><br />Part 2: Start of the real game. You're trapped in a dugeon, from witch you have to escape. <br />Most of the opponents you have to fight are creatures, and bosses.<br />The graphics are nicely done, and the story was good enough for me.<br /><br />Part 3: In this sequel you'll have to travel to a moon and to get here you have to go to a lab complex. Here you'll have to fight with objects instead of creatures.<br />The bosses have to be fought differently than usual.<br /><br />Part 4: Final part, this part shows some points of imperfection. I found some bugs in the game. Objects who weren't locked, so if you touch them again, you'd have to wait till it finishes again, and a few powerups that did't do anything. But like all other parts, very good graphics.<br /><br />Despite the bugs I still could finish this game, and I didn't regred downloading it."☃"1071821676"☃"battle.zip"☃"3.5"☃"217.121.120.236"
"Duky Inc makes me moist."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"There is so much going for this game. Battle Tech is authored by Alex Drelick, but the style is so remarkably like his brother's that one has to wonder who was the genius. Perhaps they both were. <br /><br />Battle Tech is a Duky Inc game from 1997. It's 4 files long, and take quite a while to play. One of the few games on the archive I hasten to call &quot;epic&quot;. Much like its predecessor: Overflow.<br /><br />The storytelling is nothing spectacular, but it has its moments. The real hook this game has is it's graphics and gameplay. The author has a distinct architectural mindset, and uses combines a strict use of symmetry with random spatterings of simple shapes and patterns to please the eye. Everything is in vivid colour and each board gives the eye something new to look at. There is a vast world to explore with lush forests, artic wastelands, mechanical nightmares, and everything in between. Hordes of monsters stand in your path and bosses fight you fiercely, many with their overwhelming visage looming overhead. The first two files are simple distractions from the plot, simply to test your mettle. The last two files alone could easily have been two seperate games.<br /><br />What's that you say? Don't fancy fighting prefab enemies? If you are not like me and don't really care for the classic ZZT enemies, you'll still be pulled onward to discover what lies beyond that next passage. What spectacle will you behold next? The destruction of a moon prehaps? The alien mastermind? The adventure never stops, and the action never lets up.<br /><br />Only a few flaws seperate this game from being perfect. But in the end it still stands as a feast for your itchy trigger finger, and candy for your eyes. A fantastic game that has not yeilded in power to the newer, more complex games. <br /><br />Play it now."☃"1071828759"☃"battle.zip"☃"4.5"☃"24.151.143.76"

The level design is terrible and the enemies are annoying, especially the last boss which is extremely difficult to score hits on (not because of any amazing AI though, because when it's alligned with you it shoots a constant stream of bullets.) Sadly nothing makes this game bearable to play. Rotton Robots is still better, but that's not saying much.

"Foolish games"☃"Chasewashere"☃"chasebramlage@hotmail.com"☃"Wow, I must say the zzt community hasn't changed one bit. There still is alot of foolishness going around, backstabbing everywhere, and silly kids who think they know everything about how to make a zzt game which in turn gives them the right to launch a verbal attack at those whom they fear or are jealous of. Now i dont know which of those two you fall under &quot;Funk&quot;, but you gotta get off it kid, take your issues elsewhere, dont spray them online forcing others to have to listen to your whining and blabbering, try taking up a hobby, like say: &quot;making a good zzt game&quot; for a change. I know its hard for you because your so busy telling other people (who just wanna have fun and create worlds on zzt) that their games &quot;suck&quot;, but hey give a try, you still have time to redeem yourself, perhaps people might think better of you if you try giving constructive critism rather then rambling on like a child. As far as resentment Funk, I was never even in the zzt scene, you can even ask my fellow IF clan memebers, I didnt even write anyone outside of the clan, they only letters I sent were those of thanks and appreciation to those few who were kind enough to test out my creations. So you better check your sources again kid, I dont know who you talked to, hell I probably dont even know them. As far as this whole &quot;joke&quot; about these two authors making a game just to &quot;piss me off&quot;, I must say thats pretty juvenile, if you were actually on the scene back when I was around you would have known that the Final fantasy game that I made wasnt supposed to be released, it was a personal game that I created as a test of what I could do, I had no intention of continuing it or releasing it, but somebody (I still dont know who) released it after trying it for me. <br />Sorry your &quot;joke&quot; doesnt really phase me.<br />Funk, let me spell it out for you; I am a 24 year old film Student who has worked as a Boom operator in various independent films for average wages, I dont even live in hollywood. I got started playing zzt in the early nineties, I loved it, why? definetely not because of the competition or the critiques, but because I liked creating, now tell me something, Why would some kid like you have the right to slander my name based on something you probably heard from an unreliable source? And fishfood, whatever your silly beef with me is, dont fall to funks level by turning a harmless world creator into your personal tool for attacking somebody. Its really sad you kids have such vendettas in you, perhaps in time you'll realise the error of your ways and start to wake up and smell the coffee. I did, thats why I'm not doing zzt any more, not because I dont like it, but because of little brats like you.<br /><br />Oh by the way Fishfood, I did try your game, and I liked it.

It could flow in a motion.. After a while I found ZZTek Mag #2 and it made it so ALL the colours in the room changed, with slime, spreading a fire of sorts.. This was the start of making graphics without making them.. and to be able to stop the mixer by putting it on the title screen, you can do a lot of stuff.. Changing the cycle of the object to make it a slower change.. or exploding bombs and changing bomb explosions to fakes to doors to fakes and painting over that to get a randomized background..

"wtf develin did you not read the previous reviews?"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"Lebensraum, in its presentation, is a good game. The gameplay seems too unbalanced however to make it thouroughly playable. The game is very faithful to Wolf-3d, the rooms, the secrets, the way the walls change in colours in different sections. The programming is flawless, the last boss astounding. However there are some distinct flaws that weaken the fun in this game. In the harder difficulties lack of ammunition becomes a factor fast, and considering there is little chance to avoid enemies, battles become impossible after you've run out of bullets. Guards take far to many shots to bring down and don't garner enough ammunition to make up for it. A few badly placed shots could end it for you, not to mention that the amount of hits it takes to actually kill something leaves you to eventually try rapid fire, which ultimately leaves you wasting precious ammo on already dead bodies. The game is a bit short (However the size limitation was to blame) and only one boss. <br /><br />Despite that long rant about the flaws of the game, do not doubt the awesomeness of it. There's also a &quot;fun&quot; mini game containing some golden oldie cameos. That is if you find all the secrets. "☃"1071912670"☃"lebensrm.zip"☃"4"☃"24.151.143.76"

"An exuberant thrill to rock the ages."☃"Zephyr"☃"drummermlw@msn.com"☃"Wow, no reviews. I thought WiL was more popular than that. . <br /><br />Voyage Of Four is said to be an interactive movie (It is) but it is a lot more. There is a lot more interaction than what is made out to be. Many RPG battles and puzzles make this more of an adventure genre. <br /><br />PLOT: The setting is a mid-evil type land where populations live in small vilages. The culture therefore is primative in nature. Location is purely fiction.<br /><br />Well the plot was pretty simple at the beginning, but I was thoroughly confused towards the end. It begins with the story of a man who's village is destroyed and all the residents killed (Including his family). From his wife's last breath he learns that the army which wiped out his village is led by a mysterious &quot;Man in Red.&quot; The man then devotes his life for revenge. <br /><br />Further in the story this man runs into three other &quot;heros,&quot; which is where &quot;The Voyage of Four&quot; comes from. <br /><br />The end of the story became very confusing. It rambled on about a dark realm opposite of the regular world abd bringing balance between light and dark. It gave me horrifying memories of the Chronos Wars story line. Despite this written confusion, the ending DID make sense (At least the one I took. There are four, I believe). <br /><br />Overall the plot was quite good, despite a few weak spots in writing and a bit of confusion.<br /><br />GRAPHICS: You guys all know WiL, and you know what kind of job he does. The graphics for this game were marvelous and fit the story perfectly.<br /><br />MUSIC: Recently, ZZTers haven't been focusing much on the topic of music. They don't realize, however, how much it can add to the game. A good theme on a title screen can start the game off well, or perhaps a nice song during beginning narrations. WiL uses music to his advantage, giving the game a great feel. Not only is the music excellent, but it is exactly the right amount. He does not over-do it at all. <br /><br />PROGRAMMING: Voyage of four has two main types of programming; engines and cinematics. <br /><br />This game IS an interactive cinema, so much of the programming is dialogue or movements. I did not notice any flaws in the cinematic programming. The other major part of the game includes various engines. <br /><br />WiL uses an original (I think) RPG engine which worked very well. The only thing I didn't think did much was the dodge option. Mabye I'm wrong. <br /><br />Another engine I really enjoyed tracked the player's party across a map. For each step the player took, random boulders would generate and turn into either breakables or fakes. Breakables acted as an obstacle, possibly forcing you to take a different direction. To make this engine feel like a Final Fantasy type RPG, enemies would randomly pop up on certain sqaures. When these were defeated, the player could resume his travel.<br /><br />Overall, the programming was very good. It even had a few &quot;tricks&quot; like diaganol movement.<br /><br />COMPLETE BATTERY: This game is definitely one of the better games in the archive, and should be played by aspiring ZZTers. I really enjoyed it, and didn't get the feeling of &quot;When does this end?&quot; I would give it a five, but there were a few aspects that made me think otherwise. The story became boring in some parts, and for a cinematic game, that is not good. Everything else, however, was excellent, so I give it a 4.5<br />            "☃"1072226782"☃"vo4.zip"☃"4.5"☃"205.186.86.205"

There are also a multitude of enemies for you to pump full of hot lead,  it's no as satisfiying as it sounds... there are the annoying few enemies that use stars and it gets tiresome.

As I had guessed, most of these boards were poorly designed, used pre-programed mosters, used most of the space on the board when it wasn't required, had multiple rows of solid colour, and were boring.<br /><br />I don't know how this series could be up to it's fourth game and still be this crap.

"C'mon guys..."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"After a careful replaying of the game, I decided that the above reviews do not adequetly highlight the obvious strengths of Nothing Constructive.<br /><br />Indeed the narrative element is overused, and it's more than once stated that &quot;this was the worse decision of my life&quot; or something along those lines. Dispite that the story of NC is rather enganging. The character of Zanno is an interesting hero, a post office employee who blows the crap out of a co-worker/shoots random thugs in the streets, and gets drunk quite frequently. His only real goal is to survive.<br /><br />The writing is a bit on the sloppy side, with some poor and easily predicted jokes, but there are some golden moments in this game. The courtroom scene is the most dragged out scene in the game and could very well have been eliminated or shortened significantly. I will not comment on the Communist.<br /><br />A lot of the gameplay is difficult and poorly concieved. The random shootouts with pirates/burglars/cops are frusterating. The game is sparce on health and ammo, you are only allowed to shoot one bullet at a time, and a lot of the action sequences are interupted by unneccesary spurts of plot or pointless narration. The gameplay is hit and miss. The shootouts can be fun, or tragically annoying. Being in a corridore with 8 guys shooting at you from behind a water barrier is not my idea of a fun shootout, and the programming that went into showing the other two characters dispatch their foes goes largely unnoticed by a player more interested in deducing how he's going to dodge the wall of incoming bullets. On the other hand the battle with one of the thugs is very difficult, but still is one of the more ingenious AIs I've seen in ZZT shooters, and the battle with the space pirate captain is equally well programmed.<br /><br />The random RPG battle was, well, random. Usually I don't like it when a game thrusts an RPG battle onto me unexpectedly (unless it's a game that has used many different engines all throughout), and I was a bit skeptical of the quality when reading the TXT file warning me of the impending event. I am not a fan of real time battles (Time gauge like in later Final Fantasies) but this one was a good one, the enemies used life bars, but not the breakable sort, and the main characters' HP were actuall numbers, the action was fierce and quick paced. <br /><br />There are some clever programming tricks used here, and the graphics (although composed of a lot of linewalls) are well done and abstract, much like the plot. The differences between the earth and neptune are great and add a very nice sense of atmosphere :)<br /><br />Overall, Nothing Constuctive is not a game to be avoided. It's a diamond in the rough :P Okay, that might be a little over the top... but none the less, NC is a good game that was obviously a labour of love and one worthy of your time, unless you've got less than an hour...  <br /><br />  "☃"1075793141"☃"nothing.zip"☃"4"☃"68.112.246.119"

"This game is horrible!"☃"Felix the house cat"☃"fthc@house.co.uk"☃"This game starts on a bad foot by annoying the player with this eyrie red and blue logo that looks to have been painted by a four-year-old; not that four-year-old paintings are necessarily a bad thing. But the logo gives of a made-it-in-thirty-minutes retro ZZT feel. And the colours simply don?t match in the way they?re composed.<br /><br />After pressing the button to play, I?m forced to watch this painfully boring and, frankly, cheesy and unrealistic cop vs. bad guy shootout. At this point, I?m thinking ?I can see where this is going; I should?ve refrained from downloading when I saw ?Scorch3000? as the author?. The colours and contours on this first cinema board are on par with pre-stk low-fi productions. ?This is all horribly painful,? I?m thinking to myself.<br /><br />?Shall I go through the passage?? I think to myself. And then I decide to go through with it just to see what?s behind the door. And yes, you guessed right: it?s the same old story. The first playable board is horribly pre-stk retrospective. And what?s more he?s created these ugly strips of colour, horrible horrible pre-stk colour, that reminds me of some badly engineered Lego houses I saw at primary school.<br /><br />Just when I think it can?t get any worse, I am cracked over the head with a horribly retarded and inferior introductory statement. ?You wake up and look at the clock and hit it with a small hammer,? says the narrator. Jesus, what?s wrong with you, mister narrator guy, can?t you think of anything more amusing or witty to say? And why did he have a hammer right when he needed one? That?s simply uncanny.<br /><br />Now I walk over to the computer in this grotesquely inadequate, and not to mention, clich&eacute;d ZZT house. There?s a bed over in the corner. And Scorch has taken the time to describe the softness of the pillows. Breathtaking, I?m sure. And not to mention pioneering. Anyway, when I open the fake emails on the fake computer, I am introduced to one of the silliest and most retarded preliminary plot suppositions that could possibly exist. Some guy called Danny refers to the player as ?Agent Smith? and proceeds to inform you that a terrorist has escaped from the police and that he was once on their side; and that he was a GOOD agent. Never mind.<br /><br />I get all the usual newbie ?You must stop this evil megalomaniac from using stolen technology to create a time machine BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH? crap; and at this point I?m feeling so disgusted, that I want to kill myself.<br /><br />It seems that quantity is more chief than quality in this game. There are tons of boards with no items or people, which use only two or three pre-stk colours. And while I?m traipsing around the land of boredom, I?m hoping I am not sucked in to it by some supernatural force, as it?s simply too dull. After I find the secret base, I decide to quit and view the game in the editor instead.<br /><br />Every single board in this game looks horrible. There is little no stk. The sound is limited to annoying beeps when you press buttons etc. There is absolutely no atmosphere portrayed in either graphics or rhetorical imagery. The plot could easily be rivalled by an eight-year-old ZZTer. What else can I say? Just don?t bother downloading this game. It?s not worth it even for the amusement of it being, frankly, crap.<br />"☃"1075960837"☃"cchaos.zip"☃"1"☃"167.206.201.235"

"Eh."☃"Rothul"☃☃"I'm afraid that I must disagree MadTom. <br /><br />Teen Priest 2, was quite possibly one of the most anticipated zzt games in history... so of course its coming about suffered from the classic &quot;Nukem Forever&quot; syndrome as it went through numerous rewrites and delays. Was it worth the wait?<br /><br />In my opinion no. While it is true that some aspects of the game are better than its predecessor (graphics and sound being far superior), more often than not, all of the glaring flaws that were in teen priest 1, are magnified in teen priest 2.<br /><br />The impossible dancing engine in Teen Priest I, has become two impossible shooting and sumo wrestling engines.<br /><br />The shockingly funny confession scenes, have become just shocking (and the source of the skull-fuck shit eating scene mentioned above.<br /><br />When Teen Priest ripped off movies, it ripped off good ones, like Seven and Friday the 13th. When Teen Priest II blatantly ripped off movies it ripped off... Friday the 13th part 8.<br /><br />Teen Priest I had a logical, if not altogether coherent plot. Teen Priest II throws logic and coherency to the wind... and not it a good way.<br /><br />Teen Priest perhaps brought about a new era of zzt-ing, where designers were now no longer afraid of offensive humor in their games... a zzt awakening. <br /><br />Teen Priest II brought a whole bunch of jokes involving blatant racism, under-age necrophilia, and mentally handicapped skull fuckings, for no other reason that it was there...<br /><br />And it was there, and (for me at least) just more offensive than funny. A cardinal sin in a humor game.<br /><br />Which is not to say that Teen Priest II isn't funny! No, no, a million times no! Some parts were funny as hell! But for me, the parts where &quot;ha ha he said nigger&quot; outweighed &quot;ha ha he said something genuinely witty.&quot;<br /><br />And I'm trying not to make it sound like I hated the game.

"ha ha"☃"nadir"☃"nadir427@hotmail.com"☃"I feel some background is necessary to appreciate just how brilliantly horrible Pleasure Palace is.<br /><br />It was originally released in late 2000 on zzt.org, and was not uploaded for obvious reasons. Several of the older ZZTers saw it at the time and had a good laugh at how stupid it was, then it was consigned to history.<br /><br />The other day Zamros found it on one of his old hard drives and, after several requests, uploaded it. I was happy to oblige just so everyone can read this drivel written by a horny 12-year-old about how his gym teacher scratched her ass and how it was totally hot, and how he had sex with his cousin.<br /><br />It's not a good game by any stretch of the imagination, of course.

☃"Homz"☃"sherlock_homz@hotmail.com"☃"When I heard that the third installment of My Liver Hurtz?s Nexus series was going to be out by Monday of last week, I was thrilled. Having discussed it with him on several occasions and even played some of a preview I had been offered, Nexus III was, for me, one of the most anticipated games of the year.<br /><br />Did it live up to my expectations?<br /><br />Nexus III continues to round off the evolution of My Liver Hurtz, from the rather horrible Nexus I, a decent but Spartan NII, on to the innovative yet deficient Z*Bert and Silicate. The My Liver Hurtz we see in this game is different, matured. He has studied his shortcomings and created something to be proud of.<br /><br />From the opening board of the space station to the outside shot of the K?Ton base, NIII has some graphics that are truly beautiful. Now, one must be mindful, MLH hasn?t attempted anything extremely ambitious, we are still left to our imaginations to what the K?Ton, or for that matter, our heroes look like, but what there is executed with skill.<br /><br />Of course, the emphasis in the Nexus games has never been the graphics, but the story, and, even more so in this installment, the gameplay, which consists of shootouts and engines, for the most part. The shootouts are very functional, excellently programmed, and are designed skillfully. Throughout the game, in fact, there are evidences of Liver?s great talent for programming, and, furthermore, the brilliance of his mind, in the innovation factor of the game. He employs several tricks and engines that may very well find you taking a peek at the source code.<br /><br />The story continues from NII, seeing the three Admirals from the end of Nexus II coming to the grim conclusion that the K?Ton attacks they thought were random were, in fact, far from it. With the destruction of the Orbital Nexus Targeting system, they realize, they have lost the key to the Nexus, a gravitational phase frequency that opens the portal, discovered in a lab accident. And the fact that James Concade, the only man left who could have given it to them, was sent six months ago to destroy the powerful Tamara Missile and never returned, doesn?t brighten the prospect of survival. That is, before one of them reveals something. Concade?s ex-wife, Jennifer, knows the frequency. Preposterous, the others counter, even if she was alive, she would be 90 years old, and far from being in any condition to relay the frequency to them. Wrong, he replies, she is alive on Earth, a 32 year-old petty thief, being detained at the base. Jennifer, or Jade, as she is now known, is brought before them. After being asked for the frequency, she asks them where James is. They refuse to tell her, but finally break down. She agrees to tell them, but only on one condition. That they will send her to K?Ton, fully armed, in hopes that she may be able to find the man she left ten years ago. You portal in, in front of the prison facility suspected to hold James. None of the civilians surrounding you seem to notice, but the guards, now drawing their weapons, obviously do.<br /><br />Of course, Nexus is not without its flaws. Spelling mistakes are frequent, and occasionally, one feels that the story could just be a tad more polished, and even a bit longer, at times. The difficulty, often, is none too easy either. Though not quite at the level of something like Nothing Constructive, this is still a fairly hard game. I also found that, in my opinion, the end, which I will not go into detail on, seemed more than a little rushed. Where there could have been even a slight stir of the emotions, it drew a blank; merely raised an eyebrow before ?TO BE CONTINUED...? Furthermore, it seems, that for a rather dark story, a better atmosphere could have been conveyed, but, unfortunately, there is none.<br /><br />Nevertheless, despite its flaws, Nexus: Future?s End has a lot going for it. It?s a fun game, and a breath of fresh air, when it seems ZZT is getting predictable. What?s more, to top it all off, NIII utilizes a rather fun idea: for replaying the game a second time around, you have the option to turn in-game commentary on. Of course, there's not a lot of it, but, it's still worth at the very least editing to gain some behind-the-scenes information.<br /><br />Figuring the flaws into the score, Nexus III gets a four, though, perhaps, had the flaws been corrected, it could easily have netted a 4.5, perhaps even higher."☃"1077657639"☃"nexus-3.zip"☃"4"☃"66.38.200.149"

They are difficult, but I see nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />The graphics range from very minimalistic and sparse building interiors, to cinimas that are &quot;well lighted&quot; and give a good sense of perception. Somehow this works for the game, but I can't help but feel that a little more detail in areas could help polish up the game and allow for a more convincing enviroment.<br /><br />The story wraps up very nicely, with a nod to a &quot;higher power&quot;. It's always the winners who are on God's side, huh? All in all I enjoyed the entire series, and it's good so see someone who said they were going to make a series, and actually finished it.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed a tad more game play.

"U_____U  -Zzzzz"☃"zane"☃"Humantheft@yahoo.com"☃"Let's examine this game a little closer:<br /><br />1) Medieval is not as interesting as Appliance says.<br /><br />2) The graphics lean more toward the bad side.<br /><br />3) The &quot;Plotline&quot; was not &quot;almost interesting.&quot; It was boring, tedious, and was only added as a vein attempt to quickly (takes breath) make a game seem like you put a lot of time into making it. I.E.: Why is the meeting room behind a candlestick?<br /><br />4) When I played (and edited) Medieval, I didn't see one single engine or well coded object. But what I _did_ see was that mr.bob copy and pasted multiple objects with large code over and over again, to make his file larger than most games that are of a higher grade. He also made breakable walls into objects, which would be understandable if you could shoot in the game. He did the same with normal walls, which is just rediculous. In most of the boards of the game there are multiple unnecessary objects. I.E.: You have to touch the object that you can only touch or be in contact with via multiple zapping or editing the game.<br /><br />5) I'm sorry Appliance, but the music, I hardly ever use this word, sucked. Again, sorry. I don't like to use that word, but it had to be said.<br /><br />6) What I do agree with Appliance with, is that Medieval is a nice start. Mr.bob did a well enough job programming and making art for a newbie. But what I frown on, is that he tried to make his game look bigger than it actually was. I.E.: Making a pointless art board (or boards, I can't remember) that can only be seen in the editor, multiple unnecessary objects, a multitude of text files crammed into each and every board (And if not in every one of them, there was still enough in the church to spread evenly over the entire game).<br /><br />In conclusion, mr.bob, next time you want to make a good ZZT game, think about it and plan ahead. Write out the story and think about releasing it after it's finished. It couldn't have been &quot;great&quot; but it could have been decent. Sorry to be so harsh.<br /><br />This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you."☃"1078966875"☃"Medieval.zip"☃"0.5"☃"209.214.115.74"
" and God said 'let there be a sequel'"☃"Mr.Bob"☃☃"AND THERE WAS. What do you get when you combine nice graphics, a fun game engine, and NINJA MONKEYS? You get Card Prime 2. A nice step up from the old game and the battles are much more fun. The only side note for me is the some what buggy side of this game and the poor ending. <br /><br />ON TO BUSYNESS-<br /><br />Graphics- I LIKE THEM, however the stuff that I like was made by way of a ZZT utility, thats not cool. But the other stuff is nice looking. The only thing I dont like is the LAST boss battle. UGH, that boss looked SO bad. The step up from this would be the great and all powerfull Ninja monkey!<br />So the graphics were a 3 out of 5.<br /><br />GamePlay- The game is fun, (once you understand it that is), I thought, at first, that if you face a fire monster then its better to choose a 'water' card. NOT TRUE, the only thing that will do will have the enemy have less attack power and YOU dont have as much ATK power as the enemy so thats not good. I suggest to use FIRE cards when up against FIRE monsters so you can get more hit out of your cards. Also its a good thing to have a nice healing card with you. Anyway, there were no buggs while I was playing in the battles but the 'main menu' where you choose your next battle from that will mess up constantly. =( SAD FACE. So I award the gameplay a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Sound- I like the battle music (however it became a little annyoing after awhile. BUT can you guess where the last boss' song came from? It came from Card Prime....the first one....yeah. Anyway, the sound was not &quot;WHOA COOL!&quot; but more like &quot;Cool&quot;. So I give the sound a 3 out of 5.<br /><br />So seeing these scores and to use complicated math equations out of your ability to figure out, I award CARD PRIME 2 a ....<br />                 3.5<br /><br /><br /><br />"☃"1079051260"☃"CARDP2.zip"☃"3.5"☃"209.247.222.49"
"Yeah..."☃"Mr.Bob"☃☃"I played this game months ago and Im bored so Im going to do a review! YAY!<br />Over all the game is kinda cool, I love the boat thing in the title screen. The music is well done, and the gameplay somewhat verys between worlds, (which is to be expected because everyone who made this game did their own speshul little part. ON TO ZA NUMBAS!<br /><br />Graphics- Very nice, and it keeps up the beat because it changes the styles of the graphics every time you change into another 'world/level' whatever they called it. I did notice some slack in one level however I cant recall who's it was so I'll leave off of that.<br />I give the graphics a 5 out of 5.<br /><br />Sound- I dunno, Wells up there said it could be much better but I like it. I think the cold music durring the start is cool and snuff. I give the sound a 4.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Story- I've never read the books that were used to make this games story but since it is not made entirly by them, right out of their imagination then I will take points off for that. But all in all the story is very good. I give the story a 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Gameplay- Now this is where the lack was. I did not like the first level overall because it was boring and I forgot to save and I had to do it all over again! BLARG! That nadir place was just annoying. Jacobs thing was random and I thought it just did not fit the mood that the game's story tried to set up. Wil's was also annoying in a diffrent way. I belive I told that shy girl something wrong and that messed everything up and I had to start all over again! AUGH! I DONT LIKE THAT. But I did find it very interesting to say the least. With that said I give the gameplay a 2 out of 5. <br /><br />Overall the game seemed to be rushed at some parts...meh, thats what ya get. In any other way the overall score is....<br />A 3.5 out of 5. "☃"1079221482"☃"dgate.zip"☃"3.5"☃"209.247.222.47"

"SCATHING REVIEW"☃"Zenith Nadir"☃"napalmlachatte@gmail.com"☃"Okay okay, I'm going to try very, very hard not to make this review an ad hominem attack. It hurts you, and it hurts me too. But... it will be difficult.<br /><br />I hate ZZT Crime, and I hate most of Wong Chung Bang's games too. You know that bit near the end of the newest ChickenWire where I go off on one about how his &quot;retro-style&quot; ZZT games are actually just derivative rip-offs of someone else's creativity? Well, ZZT Crime isn't quite as retro, but the point remains that he's basically let someone else do the hard work, taken the best bits and used them for his own output. In fact, it's worse here than in those games, where he at least tried to put an original spin on Tim Sweeney's zillion-year-old puzzles.<br /><br />ZZT Crime touts itself as an unofficial &quot;sequel&quot; to Barjesse's seminal ZZT Syndrome. This would be fine, if he were then to tackle problems not covered in the original file... but then the first seven boards repeat, almost word-for-word, EXACTLY what ZZT Syndrome advised; don't use yellow borders, don't use lots of monsters, don't use stars, etc, etc. Aside from being an obvious ripoff, it's also superfluous; yes, I realise that the game is geared towards amateur game designers, but even so it's not hard to tell them to just go download the original file, which is credited as &quot;inspiration&quot; on the title screen! Or maybe it's just a way to disguise your own dearth of ideas for the file? Surely not! I count that 18 of the game's 38 playable boards are dedicated to regurgitating Barjesse's advice. If it was just a little here and a little there I wouldn't mind, but good god man that's almost half the board total.<br /><br />This continues throughout; the game tells you to give the player enough health and ammo, not to lock your games (albeit with a semi-nifty &quot;runtime error&quot; animation and a better explanation of why not to use Super Locks), not to use ping-pong paths, not to beg for money, blah blah blah. All been done before, far more eloquently.<br /><br />Anyway, enough bitching about unoriginal content. The game does have some original advice, such as the evils of item fields, how to #lock and #unlock objects properly, and an intensely irritating board where you are told by the author himself how stupid and terrible swearing is, that makes me want to fuckin' smack him. These points are sound, I guess (apart from the latter, of course). Of course, these original points are interspersed with Barjesse's stuff, which as a veteran ZZTer I just find distracting, although if you're a newbie who doesn't know any better you won't mind. Saying that's okay, however, is like saying it's okay for children to watch terrible low-quality cartoons; while it won't actually harm them, they won't thank you later.<br /><br />Ironically, the game suffers from a crime itself which is not mentioned throughout; linking the wrong board through a passage! It also veers dangerously close to another crime not mentioned; PLAGIARISM. Yes, I'm really hung up on this. &quot;You vs. Stupidity 2&quot; is a far better guide on this matter, and that's not even a tutorial, it's a game where you kill Blue's Clues.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's cool to be able to type &quot;zzt crime&quot; in the DOS prompt to load the game up, and the graphics are okay (he actually uses STK this time around, thank god). Other than that, don't bother with this; get ZZT Syndrome and ZZT Pro (by Kjorteo, it's good even though I vehemently disagree with his stance on dark rooms) instead. You deserve better ZZT tutorials than this derivative rehash of someone else's ideas.<br /><br />Harsh, aren't I?"☃"1181125449"☃"Crime.zip"☃"1.5"☃"83.10.242.3"

Sure, it has the qualitys of a good game, but lack of intrest kept me from playing very far. Once I started I saw that the main character was an egg...okaaaay, thats SOUNDS original but its not, Im sure he got it off that 'flash movie egg thing I've seen on Newgrounds a few times,' so yeah, nothing new there. I remember the first time I played this game...ahh, yes horribal, just horribal. The first time I played this and found I was stuck on an island I did what any 'sea-ferring man' would do! I went in the water....and you know what happend then? Yeah, I also rememberd that eggs cant swim....=(<br />SPLOOSH! <br /><br />Graphics- Yes, one of the good things about this game is the good graphics! I like them. The graphics are given a 4.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Sound/music- I dont remember any music...Or do I? Hmph, anyway, Im sure it was not horribal or else I would have rememberd that, and made fun of it...so I give the sound a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Story- I did not like it. Its so perdictable that I had to laugh as he stumbled onto the pirate ship. Its just that corny. But they did throw him over board and I also saw comming too. YEAH.<br />The story is given a 1 out of 5.<br /><br />Gameplay- It was very hard for me to find out what to do first, and I remember nothing was fun so I give this a 2 out of 5.<br /><br />Overall- An 'okay' game with eggs.

It is indeed need of work, the graphics could be brought up since this is your FOURTH GAME. The programing is were the game falls, Chris cant program things very well, and it shows in the very 'first' bad guy you meet. The only thing about this game that I found worth my time was the funny little Yoshi title screen. Its painfully obvious that the guy could have done WAY better but must suffer for lack of lazyness. ON TO ZA NUMBERS Yo.<br /><br />Graphics- Again, not that great, but the title screen is cool....ALMOST cool.<br />I give the graphics a 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Sound/music- I dont think there was any.... So this is given a 0 out of 5.<br /><br />Story- Hahahahaha! Its a great, stupid, funny, dumb, and poorly made story. SO YEAH,3 out of 5 yo.<br /><br />Gameplay- Not fun. No creativity.

And I must say its a very good game for the first time you play through it. Sadly I found a bug, looks like all that work still did not perfect this game. OH WELL.<br /><br />Graphics- Im going to go easy considering he only had three days to make them...unless he fixed them to. Anyway, for a WOZ game the graphics are a 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Sound/Music- Hmmm, I dont think he added any. N/R<br /><br />Story- Not much story, but there seems to be some sort of god clan fights going on...thats all I grasped.<br />3 out of 5. (beacuse its a WOZ thing I did not count much off)<br /><br />Gameplay- this is were the game shines its brightest! The gameplay is straight forward KILL ALL THAT MOVES, (and some that dont move), kinda gameplay. You go around killing people and taking their skulls for a sacrifice to your god. The townspeople just yell and run away while the soldiers attack you and after a few well placed stab wounds they become pussy cowards and run for their pathetic lives! FUN. So for that I give it a 5 out of 5.<br /><br />Overall- I think there were some 'Josh Quest games' also included inside this..but they were crap and were not even worth a mention. But Chaos Warrior overall is a fun first play kinda game. Have fun. I give Chaos Woarrior a... 3.5 out of 5"☃"1079318873"☃"ChaoWarr.zip"☃"3.5"☃"209.247.222.49"

"Allrighty...."☃"Mr.Bob"☃☃"Commodore caught my attention once he reviewed this game. As in his review it says that this game was made from the pre-stk era, (thats an understatement), the graphics are not so much weird but not good altogether. There are some 'funny' little graphics going on, (such as a random char 2 stuck in this sorta pipe configeration), that, I must admit, made me laugh the most. When the game tried to be funny, it wasn't and vise-versa. <br /><br />Graphics- Overall they are crap. But it seems Noctrocide did not even try at graphics on this game, he said it was used to test a few things he wanted to try out. But that still does not take away the fact that the graphics sucked out loud. So here is your 1 out of 5.<br /><br />Sound/Music- Im sure this game did not even have any. N/R<br /><br />Story- The story is that of an evil cheese man or cheese thing that is trying to take over the internet...or Z2 or just ZZT games and turn them into crap, (Just like this game! Oh now thats a burn), but to be honest it did say that the evil cheese guy did turn the game into crap, and so you must stop the evil cheese from turning all other games into a pointless void of nonsense. Now thats a good cause! 3 out of 5!<br /><br />Gameplay- You walk, you touch objects, but the 99% of the gameplay comes when you have to run in and out of three rooms collecting a key then you take the key to the door to open it AND SO ON AND ON AND ON. It was about here that I could not take anymore and turned off ZZT and cried. 0.5 out of 5<br /><br />Overall- Do not be confused If you have tastes like Commodore then you might find this game interesting...but alas dear fellows this game deserves nothing more than what it gets, and what it gets is a ....<br /><br />1 out of 5<br />"☃"1079478127"☃"nopoint.zip"☃"1"☃"209.247.222.49"
"Bad Ass? Yes."☃"Yosoymi"☃☃"Greatest game ever? There I take issue.<br /><br />Teen Priest 1 invariably always comes up in a discussion of best ZZT games of all time, so it's natural that comparisons will be made to the sequel.<br /><br />And in many respects, yes, Teen Priest 2 was superior to the original. Johnny's more bad-ass, the art and music roxors and the humor is racheted up a thousand notches.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's one hundred times more offenisve, the plot makes fifty times less sense (basic, Madtom? what game were you playing?), and the engines are still buggy as heck (particularly the basketball engine... NOTHING HAPPENS IF YOU LOSE!!!), and coherency is thrown to the wind.<br /><br />Teen Priest 2 is not Teen Priest perfected, so much as it is Teen Priest amplified... for good or for bad.<br /><br />Teen Priest two scores a lot on pure personality alone, but personality doth not perfection make.<br /><br />DrAc0 a legend? Of course! Teen Priest 2 his most legendary game? No."☃"1079491582"☃"tp2.zip"☃"4"☃"172.140.147.119"

My freaking inspiration and when Draco left I felt the zzt community needed more games like that though my games were crapper. Anyway, TP2 boasts cool graphics, cartoony they may be but cool. The title music has been remixed (well kinda) and now it sounds slightly 'darker' and deep and gameplay is as good as the first but yeah, like its been discussed above, the material are more along the lines of offensive rather than funny. and thats coming from me, an idiotic bastard who makes a fool out of himself. Get this game (you prolly have it anyway) just for the gameplay, the game is funny, just not AS funny as the first one."☃"1079529965"☃"tp2.zip"☃"4"☃"193.60.73.98"
"Hmmmm, hahahahahahahahaha!"☃"Mr.Bob"☃☃"I never played the first kane project and I must admit that I really do not want to. However in the history of the games it seems some guy saved some city from a god named Kane. Cool. But now your a loser who uses curse words so much it seems like he is some five year old who just discoverd them. Ahem, the story after the first one is mostly a stupid one were the main character kills some guy in a bar because of some money trouble. Now he is in prison and is ready to die. YAY! <br /><br />Graphics- Not to bad not too good. I must admit the game looks like a noobie's work and must have SOME compliment on how bad they are.<br />.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Story- Not only are the graphics bad but the story plot is one used over and over again, FAIL.<br />0 out of 5.<br /><br />Sound/Music- I think there was SOME.<br />.5 out of 5<br /><br />Gameplay- Mostley a get this, then find the way out sorta play. FAIL.<br />0 out of 5.<br /><br />FunFactor- The game is very repetitive and nothing interesting, nothing but collect this and then get out of the place your in. NOT FUN. 0 out of 5<br /><br />Overall- Buh, this game sucks. I must admit Robins Hood is better than this, that is really bad. Overall no fun, no laughs, just Master Raze trying to look cool by puting alot of curse words in his game. FAIL...<br /> 0 out of 5<br /><br />"☃"1079563109"☃"TKP2D12.zip"☃"0"☃"209.214.201.108"
"Tribute to Duke Nukem"☃"Caspar"☃☃"This is a game about Duke Nukem, you may know (or not). In this game, he has to fight aliens like he always does.<br />There is some humor in the game, and there are normal graphics. The story isn't too good, but it's enough to have made me finish the game.<br /><br />I appreciate the attempt to make Duke Nukem a ZZT character, so I'll give it a 3."☃"1079622395"☃"duke.zip"☃"3"☃"217.121.120.236"
"Let the current carry me far away!"☃"Mr.Bob"☃☃"Yes this game is very good. I love the rpg battles but what Commodore says is right there is no challenge to them, just hope you dont miss when you attack.<br /><br />Graphics- Nicly done for such an old game, I like that knight, (he is the 2end guy you fight), he looks cool. Hell, these graphics could compare to some games just comming out too. So yeah the graphics are given a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Sound/Music- Moslty noobie stuff here but thats just fine because he does not overdue it. So yeah, 2 out of 5.<br /><br />Story- I think the story is not that great but still is diffrent, it left me with wanting to know if the guy I was playing was evil or good. Thats cool, everything that happend after the start of the game is predictable. So yeah, better than most games. 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Gameplay-You run around, fight an RPG battle, run around, fight an RPG battle. Very repetive because nothing really can make each battle diffrent than the last. 2 out of 5.<br /><br />FunFactor- Some is to be had, and it is nice. Dont let this game pass you by. 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Overall- If he could have made the battles a little diffrent and more interesting then the game would be top notch. But alas, such is not the case. <br />3 out of 5."☃"1079657519"☃"defender.zip"☃"3"☃"209.247.222.49"
"Im a dancin on Moon Light bay."☃"Mr.Bob"☃☃"Ahhh, the end huh? I guess I should have played the other games first. All in all the game was not so much as a game but more like a ZZT movie...that sucks because ZZT does NOT make movies so well.<br /><br />Graphics- Very little detail but the cinimas make up for that because that seems to be the only part of graphical detail this guy wanted to put in his game. Still, the overall is not bad...but not so good either. 3.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Sound/Music- The music was rock solid and unlike other people who think if the music was not made by MadTom then it sucks, I think making your own music sound that good gives you some nice points. 4.5 out of 5 <br /><br />Gameplay- Allrighty, the gameplay boasts of many engines and collect this and open this sort of play. The engines, of short, are not HARD but notoriously aggravating. EX: Are you supposed to aim for that green thing on the left screen? Well I hit it billions of times and it DID NOT DIE. There is also some laser thing you have to dodge, (in and out of a space craft), while your dodging shots in the space craft just go all the way over to the left and they will NEVER hit you. In short this game lacks gameplay but tries to come back with witty and complicated mini-games. 2 out of 5.<br /><br />Story- Get ready, for this is where the game shines, or so you have been told over and over again. The story is intresting to say the most, but it is FAR to predictable to be of any long going intrest. So you get points for being all cool in your descriptions of your fighters. 3 out of 5<br /><br />FunFactor- Not much, but just enough for you to compleat the game. 2 out of 5.<br /><br />Overall- Being as this is the END of a series of a story you can be a little forgiving for the mass amount of cinimas. If your a big fan of these game as Commodore is, then it is well worth the download. All in all, I give this game a solid...<br />3 out of 5"☃"1079849801"☃"oprgv4.zip"☃"3"☃"209.247.222.46"

"Smiley Guy and Toxic Terminator"☃"Al Payne"☃"al.payne@juno.com"☃"A word from the author . . .way to go Underdogs!  Nice to see the old games have survived.  Here's a bit of ZZT trivia about how these games came about.  Smiley Guy was one of the winners of a game contest that Epic Megagames sponsored to generate interest in ZZT.  I deliberately left off the password protection.  So, it's great to see what Zenith did to improve the graphics.  In fact, I had a graphically improved version of Smiley that I submitted, but it was too late to make Epic's publication.  By the way, I no longer live at the address that you find early in the game.  <br />Smiley received fan mail. Yeah, fan mail!  Tim Sweeney at Epic told me that Smiley might have been the most popular of the contest entries.  So, I sent him a sequel, Toxic Terminator.  At first, Tim rejected it, because he was moving to 256-color graphics with Jill of the Jungle, which I got to test while in prototype.  Later, he called me and said his office got hooked on Toxic.  So, Toxic became Epic's last ZZT game tied to the roll out of Jill of the Jungle.<br />ZZT is fun and addictive.  Enjoy!"☃"1080160219"☃"zzttoxic.zip"☃"5"☃"12.2.142.7"
"hlo omg"☃"Zenith Nadir"☃"nadir427@hotmail.com"☃"Dude, you're not meant to post reviews of your own games on this database. But I'll let it go because this is a smart game, and you're a hero for making these games back in like 1991 and the writeup is quite interesting in terms of history.<br /><br />Anyway thanks for liking my remake that I did in like 1999, even though it kind of sucked =(<br /><br />Uh. I should write an actual review.<br /><br />Well, there's not much to say, really. As far as games from 1991 go, the Smiley Guy games are the cream of the crop, so to speak (being previous winners of the superold ZZT's Revenge contest). The story is pretty simple- stop a mad doctor taking over the world- but I think this was the first game to frequently use objects as enemies (as opposed to like lions and crap), and the programming in general is a step ahead from a lot of games at the time.<br /><br />The graphics are also awesome considering the lack of STK at the time, too. So is the music- the Toxic Terminator theme is still one of my favourite pieces in ZZT speaker sound (remember I used it on the stereo in Blue Moon?).<br /><br />The whole thing is really good. If you've not played it, you ought to."☃"1080169080"☃"zzttoxic.zip"☃"4.5"☃"138.253.162.90"
"Yeah, and I was all like...."☃"mr.bob"☃"tankiller@msn.com"☃"Hmm, did this game have any STK? I forgot, It looked like it did'nt, (which is cool). It seems Freedom Fighter is a noobie game but none the less it is a fine noobie game. The graphics are up to par, (you can tell what they are at least), and the story is just fine for a first time. Some bugs, some bad yellow boarders, simplistic gameplay, and not that great music make up Freedom Fighter, but dont give up Shujj!<br /><br />Graphics- nothing diffrent, but nothing eye torture either. You can make out what the things are and thats good. ONE LITTLE THING, THERE ARE YELLOW BOARDERS. So yeah, next time you make a game please destroy those evil, evil, yellow boarders, thank you!<br />2 out of 5. (it would have been 3 but those ...yellow....boarders...)<br /><br />Sound- There are some attempts at music here, but I think I've heard it somewhere before, Im getting a connection to Ned the Knight, overall the music could have just been left out. It really does not help the game at all. 1 out of 5.<br /><br />Gameplay- Sweet, Mission based gameplay. The gameplay puts you in diffrent missions and they are all diffrent, from simple assassinations to infiltrate missions. Not new but it has its good sides. 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Story- The story will explain why you kill people and fighting for indepedance and stuff, but the story reall does nothing else for the game.<br />1 out of 5.<br /><br />Funfactor- Simplistic gameplay with a few twists, nothing to keep you playing for long. 2 out of 5.<br /><br />Overall- Shujj you could become so much more. Expaned on what you just did and you will be going somewhere. Add a little bit more story, add a real character that the peopel can, (in some way or another), relate to, and some intresting gameplay and you have a good game.

"Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight...."☃"mr.bob"☃"tankiller@msn.com"☃"Nexus: Future's Past SE is a remake made by Commodore. Its the same game really, but with improved graphics. The story, (as most people say), is the main emphasis in the game. I found the story a little one sided and over all it really did not help the game to much. <br /><br />Graphics- Ahh, improved and better. They are overall a great leap from the original game. They give you the feeling that you really are in that forest, or in the dark cave. The graphics give you what you want, and dont let up anywhere. 4.5 out of 5<br /><br />Sound- The sound is very well done. Even if there were no big musical numbers it gives the game what it needs, when it needs it. 3 out of 5<br /><br />Gameplay- Collect gems...I hate it. Also the 'most annoying room' is very...annoying. Simplistic gameplay and some puzzels. What you see is what you get. 2 out of 5<br /><br />Story- Now we come to the games main subject in the game. The story is actually very one sided and I dont think there was anything in the game made me say: &quot;Whoa! Didn't see that comming!&quot; Its good, but nothing amazing.<br />3.5 out of 5<br /><br />Funfactor- The funfactor category is ussaly rated on the gameplay, and if the gameplay sucks then you can bet the funfactor category will suck too.<br />3 out of 5.<br /><br />Overall- Very likely something to go on with, and looky, he did.

Far from it. It's just not worth a 5 though. Why? Well so far every reviewer has neglected to even comment on what the game is actually like...<br /><br />You control Zem, a lemming sort of creature. It plays much like lemmings except you only control the one and there is no mouse cursor. Zem walks back and forth in a straight path until you tell him either to build a stair, bash through a rock, or other lemming type things. The controls are a little weird to get used to, what with looking at the side bar to make sure you're going to the the right thing before falling off a cliff, and it gets a little frusterating in a few tight spaces where you don't have a lot of time to act. Still the concept is pretty novel for a zzt game. I think it's a little on the easy side though and once you beat it once you can forget about it for a while.<br /><br />Graphically the game is simple and pleasing. Certainly Newt has a good grasp of the concept of video game aesthetics as can be plainly seen on the title board. <br /><br />"☃"1081984768"☃"zem2.zip"☃"4"☃"68.186.246.132"

"It's good to be good"☃"tyrannous"☃"medieval@fairytooth.co.uk"☃"Warning: this is not a game.<br /><br />This is probably the best collection of art on Zedtwo, and it?s the nearest you are going to get to photo-quality art with the limitations of ZZT. But I think it would be wise to say that there is a certain majesty that goes beyond the limitations, and the art itself is vivid, and iridescent with pioneering concepts. All the animals drawn are complete with hideous or beautiful appearances. Some of them have wicked looking faces complete teeth and grimaces. The use of STK is the best I have ever seen in this ZZT file; the colours are blended and arranged in comical images for the best possible ZZT art.<br /><br />Unfortunately they let Peter Saltfleet (Nadir) do the narrative and preamble. His barely conscious and unfunny rhetoric is utterly painful to read. But since this is an art collection, the bad writing skills are irrelevant; so I am awarding five stars."☃"1082785444"☃"OWNAGE.zip"☃"5"☃"195.92.67.79"
"Go back and DO IT AGAIN"☃"medieval"☃"medieval@fairytooth.co.uk"☃"The title ?Flower of Light? will be considered ?cheesy? by many, but insofar as the motive behind it can be discerned, I don?t really have a problem with this name. The game itself is quit boring. You must go to ?Fairyland? and find a flower that will cure the blindness of your king. Yawn.<br /><br />Although the plot preamble is charming, it is unfortunately debased with the impurities of nonsense. It seems that the author had a fairly good idea for the plot, but rushed its conception. And ultimately the viewer is left confused as to whether it deserves full acclaim.<br /><br />When I finished the game, I was left somewhat disappointed because it seems that the author put a lot of effort into the atmosphere of the game, but rushed the narrative and plot elements. I enjoy games that can offer a unique atmosphere; like the wistful feelings of decay in DPLobster?s ?Daymare?, the cold and breezy evocation of Herc?s ?A Community X-mas?, and the seriously retro-eighties feel of Well?s ?ESP?. But these outstanding atmospheres require a firm plot-base to uphold them; and it is vital that the author of a game has good literary skills. Unfortunately this requirement wasn?t met in ?Flower of Light?.<br /><br />The graphics in ?Flower of Light? don?t remain at the original level of superiority. By the time you get halfway through the game, the boards appear rushed at best. The puzzles in the game are far too easy to solve. Does anyone remember those puzzles in ?Town of ZZT?? Now that?s what I want to see in these modern ZZT games.<br /><br />Gameplay wasn?t very appreciable. You would expect uniqueness in monsters in a modern ZZT game, not prefab enemies. And you get given too much health and ammo. The rpg battles are just copied from the original pioneering battles of other games. The author of this game hasn?t done anything to make them original, or even challenging. Boring.<br /><br />The ending in this game is awful, and it was so quick too. A quick ?You bring teh magik flower to da king and cure his eyes and stuff and the princess is saved and stuff. The End?. Sigh. I wanted something that would bring a tear to my eye. And you would expect that from a game with a title like ?Flower of Light?, wouldn?t you? Yes, you would.<br /><br />(My new method of awarding stars is to divide the maximum possible 5 stars between the five major aspects of a game. Action, Atmosphere, Graphics, Originality, and Plot. I will award a complete star if the aspect shows to be pioneering in some way, half a star if it is merely passable, and otherwise no star will be awarded. If the final score is not an integer, I just round it up.)<br /><br />Action: too much ammo, boring unoriginal monsters, puzzles too easy, no enough ?hands on? action; 0.5<br /><br />Atmosphere: not too bad, but was hindered by rubbish plot and uneasy design; 0.5<br /><br />Graphics: not too bad, but waned as the game went on, and was terrible as the game came to a close; 0.5<br /><br />Originality: clich&eacute;d and barely evolved plot; RPG battles were uninviting; 0.5<br /><br />Plot: uninspired; cheesy title ?Flower of Light?; 0.5<br /><br />Stars: 2.5 rounded to 3"☃"1082806410"☃"Flower.zip"☃"3"☃"195.92.67.77"

"Weak"☃"Spectere"☃"the_spectere@hotmail.com"☃"I started playing this game with fairly low expectations.  Not only was it created by an author whom I had never heard of but it was also rather small for the first part of a &quot;multi-disc&quot; game.<br /><br />When I fired up ZZT and hit 'P' I was thrust right in the middle of the action.  There was no background information; all I knew was that my best friend died.  As far as I can gather, the game centers around a war between two rival street gangs, the Green Dragons and the Red Dragons.  Of course, I can't really say for sure -- that was all inferred from the dialogue.<br /><br />While there are some very good games that don't reveal much of the storyline at the beginning (i.e. Code Red) this one doesn't really give the player enough time to figure everything out -- I think I beat this in under three minutes.

But anyways, anyone who likes adventure games or RPG games really must give it a try. This game also has a VGA remake, if you can find it, but that takes away from some of the fun.

I didn't care too much for some of Aetsch's art, but it was also well done. Only two things to complain about: I don't really like fonts, and Zenith occasionally broke his promise not to add captions/text to the art. However, neither of these were significant problems, and the art was of high quality for ZZT, so I'll rate this 5/5."☃"1083024056"☃"OWNAGE.zip"☃"5"☃"4.65.225.226"
"Yes"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"This game is a throwback to the original TS games that comes with ZZT. The second game by Wong Chung Bang in this style, this game is addictive and fun and very reminicient of the games he is trying to emulate.<br /><br />Just as in Town and the rest, your mission is to find 5 purple keys to escape from the Pyramid. A liberal spattering of well designed puzzles, and combination of preprogramed and object enemies makes this a worthy addition to the ZZT saga. WCB's first game of this type, Tower of ZZT, was not as well designed as this one. The former was formulaic and required no exploration, which did not capture the feel of the original games. Pyramid on the otherhand, is exceedingly better, with a large area to explore, non-linear gameplay, and puzzles that are fun and (to an extent) original.<br /><br />The game comes with two files. The first is the game with it's original graphics. The second is revamped with STK. Even in the non-STK version the game graphically exceedes the originals, with a stronger emphasis on fades and symmetry. You're not going to find cutscenes or graphics that pretend to be three dimensional, but that was never the point, and the lack there of does not hurt the mission of the game. Indeed, the simplisic graphics are less taxing on the eyes as the disjointed colour fest that was The City of ZZT. WCB's decision to abandon the excessive line wall aspect of the originals is much appreciated.<br /><br />The writing, what little there is, is the only distracting part. As you collect keys, you get mystical engouraging messages, and some are really cheesy. Again, the intent of this game is not to stun you with a gripping story, the intent is the suck your brain out through your eyes with addictive gameplay, something this game is full of...<br /><br />but not too much...<br /><br />Pyramid of ZZT is considerably shorter than its 1991 bretheren, falling short of the Caves of ZZT by about 23 boards. Pyramid has a total of 16. Still this is understandable with what one has to work with, the format WCB is using is old, and fresh ideas can easily run out fast.<br /><br />Do you enjoy playing the original ZZT games? Then you should probably go outside more, but never-the-less, The Great Pyramid of ZZT is for you."☃"1083086759"☃"gtpyrmid.zip"☃"4.5"☃"68.186.246.132"

"Is this thing really worth a 5?"☃"Mr.bob"☃☃"     Ownage Triangle. This is not a zzt game but a collection of art boards done by two people who left ZZT years ago. Nadir gatherd the art and added a few little knickknacks here and there. Besides alot of art boards this 'game' has a few long speeches by Nadir, and a demo of sorts of a game called, &quot;THE PIT&quot;.<br />Now, Ownage Triangle has really no gameplay in it besides looking at art, but thankfully that is where the game excels the most in. It will show you PURTY art, possibly the best that art can get in ZZT. Besides having almost no gameplay there is no music. (That I can remember). So, this is basically a short art museum tour. Not that its a bad art museum tour but lets say that the trip is TO short.<br /><br />Gamplay-(I'll base this on &quot;THE PIT&quot;) <br />        Lets face it. Art Boards get boring. They get boring FAST. So it really is a nice addition to Ownage Triangle to have a nice little dungeon hack. The graphics of the dungeon hack simply dont give you much of a feel for the total atmosphere of the game so that sort of brings gameplay down a bit. There are many challenges and a few tid bits along the way but overall it is a bit repetitive and annoying. 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Music- Like I said I did not hear any or mabey my music thing was off. So no score here. N/A<br /><br />Graphics- Some of the best in ZZT. &quot;THE PIT&quot; however has poor graphics. I like seeing ZZT go this far, and hope we all can make ZZT art like this one day.<br />4.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Funfactor- Not much fun in a short art tour, and &quot;THE PIT&quot; does add some much needed gameplay but just does not keep up the beat that long. 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Story- Oh, yeah. This game has a great story. N/A<br /><br />Overall- Nice, worth the download, but not the perfect 5 out of 5 scores its been getting. <br />3.5 out of 5 "☃"1083535336"☃"OWNAGE.zip"☃"3.5"☃"209.247.222.27"

"Its like Halo 2 but not."☃"mr.bob"☃☃"A new game by the game master, (or game disaster), Appliance. Appliance's games over the years have almost always varied by Genre. This is his first Platformer to hit this site. Pandemonium Alpha is a solid platformer with some puzzels, somewhat annoying enemies that can jump from the floor to the ceiling, varying bosses, and a dissappointing story. The gameplay however is very well done but sometimes can be plain annoying.<br /><br />Gameplay- The gameplay is solid, and the enemies give you a hard time to get by. Sure the blind ninjas that can jump from the floor to the ceiling are kinda easy, the metal turrents are put in the most annoying places EVER, (Even in the first level). There a 5 parts of a level you have to go through, the fith part is always a boss. The bosses are very well done in programming, but in art style they somewhat look bland. Alot of the bosses, however, dont really need that much detail in art. How you beat them is the same, look for the weak point and fire away. (One boss, The Metal Spider, you cant kill with bullets, you have to find a different approach.) Few last things, you have unlimited ammo, there is a grappling hook, (COOLNESS), and like in the Megaman games there are spikes that kill you by just touching them. =( HULK SMASH. All in all, the gameplay is pure and has just enough variety to get you through the game. 4.5 out of 5<br /><br />Sound- The music is perfect. One can't say no to Level 5's music. In the game the cut scenes have music that propel the mood of the game onward. Appliance also put in music while you play the levels in the game. At first this sounds cool, but it gets VERY annoying after one or two minutes. The music is varried and can be very engaging and mood altering. (such as the fourth level where there is some light stealth action involved.) Together these pices of music are very well done but get annoying once you've heard them for awhile. 4.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Graphics- The graphics in the gameplay certainly lack flair, but you would think the cut scenes would make up for it. They dont. But the graphics do add to the 'look' of the game so you really cant complain that much.<br />3 out of 5.<br /><br />Story- It gives you some insight into the dark history of this small galaxy. There defiantly should be some more background into the diffrent 'worlds' that reside in this game. But sadly the only two plantes you know is the 'good' planet, and the 'bad' planet. (Lucindea and Drakor, however you spell them.)The story tells a tale of a young girl who saved her planet from impending doom and was cryogenicly frozen to keep her for the next time she was needed. Fenx, (her new partner), is somewhat of a perv and loves Rina. Rina, on the other hand, would kill Fenx faster than you can say, &quot;Cheesy-pun-pinker-nickle&quot;, if she did not need him to pilot her to her different mission areas. The game has great character development but the lack on other things really leave more to be disired. 3 out of 5.<br /><br />Funfactor- Some fun is to be had. Be it the perverted jokes of Fenx, or the feeling you get once you've taken down an entire space fleet and sniped out one of the generals of the opposing army. 3.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Overall- A nice game for when you have some free time.

"Leaps and bounds..."☃"Dapper Gent"☃"dadsquad@aol.com"☃"...and Lyle the Panda is stuck in the pound!!<br /><br />Panda-Monium: Alphabits is the latest sound novel from Goodwich Appliances, a former kitchenware manufacturer that just started making games this past spring. Does it fare as well as their grilled cheese sandwich maker? Well...<br /><br />STORYLINE:<br /><br />The storyline (which is what counts most in a sound novel) is very juvenile: you take the role of Lyle the Panda, who lives with his owner, a little boy named Jeffy Bone on Neat Street. Everything is fine and dandy, until one evening, you hear the incessant ringing of a telephone from the front yard. You venture out of your pandahouse. The next thing you know, you're in the back of a van and you're heading for the pound!! Why? That's what YOU have to figure out!<br /><br />Although the story is aimed at younger audiences, there are a few jokes and examples of social satire that us adults will chuckle knowingly to ourselves at. My favourite of these is a scene involving club politics in the secret barroom in the back of the pound, which I won't spoil for you, but let me tell you, it's a real hoot. Anybody who can read will enjoy this game. Unfortunately, the majority of the public do not have this skill, so this gets points off.<br /><br />GRAPHICS:<br /><br />I'm very pleased with what characte designers Alcazar Geddy did with this: No anthromorphic &quot;furs&quot;, that you'd see in most of today's games, movies or political rallies; Geddy stuck with making each animal look like a real animal. The rabbits? They're no bigger than the size of your hand, and they look at you blankly, or in slight confusion, like a real rabbit would. The birds? You don't see the birds up-close-and-personal, because, like real birds, they fly away in a panic when you approach! Bravo, Geddy! Bravo!<br /><br />The backgrounds can be a bit bland at times, but some scenes shine like no other. My favourite backgrounds are Neat Street, the secret barroom, the weight-lifting yard, and the spooky and atmospheric basement of the pound.<br /><br />SOUND:<br /><br />Goodwich Appliances must have pulled some major strings somewhere, because they got K(yrgyzstan)-Pop idol Naryn Baryn-chan to sing the opening theme, &quot;Vinny Viddy Volvo&quot;. The song shines through the mud like headlights on a struck-down five-year-old girl. It even prompted me to buy a Naryn Baryn-chan album (&quot;Sixty Fathers With No Way Home&quot;, if you're wondering, and it's superb).<br /><br />The rest of the music, however, is standard Casio demo music. Not bad, but nothing mind blowing.<br /><br />AESTHETICS:<br /><br />Most sound novels have the same aesthetics; look, investigate, talk, move, use item, etc. And for this, Panda-Monium does its job well. There's a minigame near the end: a cowboy style quickdraw shootout with---oh, I can't spoil it! The controls in this minigame are responsive, and accurate. The guns miss every time, and occasionally jam and explode in your hand (paw?). I'm LOVING it.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, Panda-Monium hasn't brought anything new to the table. Surprisingly, it's a fun little game from a kitchenware manufacturer! The heartwarming tale and slightly lewd humour kept me hooked to the end, and I'm sure it'll do the same to you.<br /><br />So, to Panda-Monium: Alphabits, and to Goodwich Appliances, I raise my glass.

It's as if you've comissioned a time machine for the incredibly stupid task of charting the history of an ANSI game programs.<br /><br />In any case, it's worth seeing for a laugh or two (especially Tucan's thinking that Yenrab was a guy,), and a definite reccomendation to anyone looking for some old-skool zzt.

"Hooray for improvements"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"The progression of skill SKC Soft has showcase in the Ikari games is quite visible in the third. The detail has improved, with identifible backgrounds and far more semblance of a plot. There are some gameplay issues, but it is satisfying(and humourous) to see a 100 or so &quot;super-soldiers&quot; whitle their numbers down to 5 within seconds. Also one thing that should be know by anyone programming an enemy is that you can't shoot it when it's touching you, which makes the stair case scene a little annoying. There are artboards and cutscenes here, which help drive the plot. And there's a little more freedom. It's not difficult at all, you start with about 4000 health and 32000 bullets, making the shops and vending machines you encounter pointless.  <br /><br />FOr SKC Soft I'd suggest learning to program enemies better, using perpendicular movement, random movement, and learning when to use &quot;?&quot; instead of &quot;/&quot;. There are times when the enemies get hung up in their flailing deaths. Learning what makes a good enemy in zzt can really only only come from playing others games, and doing a lot of experimentation.<br /><br />Graphically I think it's time for SKC Soft to start experimenting with either ZZTAE's fade tool, or kededit's gradient tool, even if his choice is to use the built-in editor, this will give him some idea about what a good fade looks like.<br /><br />Also he needs to work on his symmety.<br /><br />I saw the improvements in this one I suggested to him previously, so I hope this encourages him more.

"Absolutely Terrible"☃"Oris"☃"oris472@hotmail.com"☃"Dr. Dos said it all, really.  What we have here is a bunch of engines stolen from the ZZT encyclopedia, it's put all together in an attempt to trick the player into believing that he has just downloaded a new cutting-edge ZZT OPERATING SYSTEM!!<br /><br /><br />...riiight.<br /><br />To spare you the trouble of having to download this and see for yourself how bad it is, which you will definitely regret, I'll go into some detail, deconstructing the so-called &quot;features&quot; of this... this... &quot;thing.&quot;  There are three different &quot;modes&quot; you are given to choose from when you load WISH.  Regular, Safe Mode, and Deluxe.  As far as I can tell, there is no reason at all  to select Regular or Safe modes, all they do is make the graphics considerably worse AND take away some of the features.  Why do this?  Why take a bad thing and make it worse?  It's as if the author thinks that Wish DX might make ZZT &quot;unstable&quot; on certain machines, because it is sooooo advanced, there must be 3 different modes so all kinds of computers can run this.<br /><br />Uh-huh.<br /><br />Next on our tour, we are taken to a jukebox, creatively titled &quot;My Player&quot; (ISN'T THAT CLEVER)  In the jukebox, you are treated to &quot;6&quot; different musical selections... it turns out that in reality, you only get 5.  The author didn't know the notes to one of the songs, so it links to a request to send him the notes if you know them.  Cute.  Also included are some visualizations, supposedly 3, however there didn't seem to be a way to select anything.  It's nothing spectacular, just your standard invisible fades in a small 8 by 10 box in the corner of the screen.  Boring.  If you have nothing better to do with your time, you can even go into the editor and put your own music into one of the 4 &quot;user slots&quot; which are empty objects... then you can go into WISH and listen to it whenever you like!!!  Gone are the primitive times when you would be forced to rely on a rudimentary ZZT board that you must create yourself using a couple of buttons... you would actually have to use this method to store your music!!  Thank Zeus, wish is released and now we can go through an unneccessary loading process and store our music creations in up to 4 &quot;user slots.&quot;  If this doesn't feel cheap enough to you, the ZZT music creator thing from the encyclopedia has been stolen and placed in here as a &quot;music editor&quot; for your convenience... rejoice...<br /><br />Next we come to &quot;Project Pro&quot; which is a complete waste of time.  Honestly.  There is a .txt document reader which is a waste of time if you have access to a program such as Notepad, there's the graphics creator straight out of the Encyclopedia, and a &quot;Spreadsheet Creator&quot; which allows you to put a bunch of colored solids on a grid.  Nothing to see here...<br /><br />We come to &quot;Games&quot; next and here is where I was hoping to be impressed.  (HAHAHA YEAH RIGHT)  We have Wish Invaders up first, which is truly awful and has very little in common with Space Invaders, a far superior game.  Wish Demonz is directly stolen from some other game where you walk around a &quot;3d&quot; labyrinth and fight pre-programmed monsters at random... however, it doesn't matter because you come in through a blocked passage, so selecting this will force you to restart the program.  Then we have the breakout game which I have definitely seen somewhere else, it's stolen and seems to be buggy.  The creator also thoughtfully included a section for &quot;other games&quot; where you, the user, can send him some games you want to see in future WISH releases.. *chokes on vomit*  No, seriously, he wants you to send him some games to put in the next version!  To quote:  &quot;If I approve of it (fun or not), then I will put it in Wish.&quot;  Fun or not!!  This attitude shown by the programmer clearly shows us why this so-called operating system fails to deliver.  So-called &quot;fun&quot; is not one of his priorities.  Having reached this shocking conclusion, I cannot in good conscience continue to review this abomination.  <br /><br />Dr. Dos WAS being very kind with his 2/5.  The two newbies who reviewed this and were sooo impressed by it that they felt the need to argue with reviews by more experienced members, should take a few moments to check out the Rules of writing reviews... &quot;One review per person, per game.&quot;  This isn't intended to be a discussion forum... that's what the Forums are for.<br /><br />I'll borrow a phrase from Appliance, to sum up this entire review...<br /><br />FAIL"☃"1089485736"☃"wish1.zip"☃"1"☃"12.219.55.48"

"Give me the nice bright colours, I'd love to take"☃"MadTom"☃"madtom@gmail.com"☃"&lt;I&gt;Aura&lt;/I&gt; is the second major release of Dr. Dos', and depending on your perspective on community games like &lt;I&gt;Mooseka Richtlinen mit einer Eisenfaust&lt;/I&gt;, may be remembered as his best. It is an action/strategy game hybrid with influences from eastern philosophy, Ikaruga, and of course, ADOM.<br /><br />In an alternate plane where every being, except of course karmics such as yourself, has an aura of either blue, green, or red, imbalance has occurred and the aurae are struggling against one another. You're out to change all that, even if it means destroying everything in the universe. Dr. Dos refers to these as the 'extinction' endings, comprising three of seven possible conclusions to the game (not counting death), one of the games' most recommending features.<br /><br />Or perhaps you'd just like to have one aura dominate, and then face the boss of that particular aura and lay down some good ol' fashioned karmic whoop-ass, using your unique ability to change aurae to meet that of your opponents. And you're going to be doing that a lot.<br /><br />So you run around changing your aura as you meet your opponents. It sounds simple enough, but the levels ascend in difficulty reasonably evenly, and there are one or two that took me four or five save/die/restore attempts to complete. Others are a cakewalk, however. The enemies vary in strength and intelligence, while each aura maintains its own distinct characteristics (red creatures won't even move toward you much if at all, but they hurt a lot if you do contact them - but the blue ones are the true nasties).<br /><br />One problem with the game is that at points it can get tedious. I would have been interested had Dos included some slightly less action-oriented puzzles - buttons that change the aura of opponents, or open gates, or using objects, or similar linear puzzles, in the vein of the development that craNKGod introduced into &lt;I&gt;Little Square Things&lt;/I&gt;. That would have been neat. Some music or sound for the game would also have been nice (said MadTom, who was asked to do just that).<br /><br />Graphics are one of Dos' self-confessed weaknesses, but what the game lacks in an aesthetic sense is made up for in reasonably in-depth level design and a somewhat addictive, though appropriately simple, premise. I can't, for reasons obvious, comment on the title screen and menu.<br /><br />&lt;I&gt;Aura&lt;/I&gt; is not an easy game. You are not going to beat it, regardless of your choice of ending, without saving/dying/restoring at least a few times. There are several tricks and traps, some obvious and predictable, others quite nasty. You are likely to learn a few strategies ... which aura is best for the very first steps of each level?<br /><br />The Ultimate Karmic God ending in particular is reasonably (but not incredibly) difficult to get. The only advice I will offer you is to have a good stockpile of health. Actually, that applies to just about every level of the game ... good thing health bonuses are reasonably abundant.<br /><br />All in all, the game is one of the best uploads to the site this year, appropriately also being the very last one uploaded. Dr. Dos' skill as a ZZTer puts him easily within the range of Quantum P., Commodore, and other present-day whizkids of the ZZTing scene, and I'm very much looking forward to his next release.<br /><br />Good job, Dos!"☃"1106277416"☃"Aura.zip"☃"5"☃"220.236.163.144"

"A leap forward in ZZT gaming!"☃"dave2"☃"dragopublish@hotmail.com"☃"With it's astonishing 14 lines of code, 3D talk engine breaks the fourth wall in ZZT, nay, worldwide gaming history.  Put aside for a minute the fact that the board you play on only takes up 2.7KB out of the 49KB within the zip file (28KB of that is a .doc file with a total of six lines, one of which is &quot;Finally! After all these years! I?ve reaserched how to make characters that talk in 3d!&quot;  Another 14.5KB of that is toolkits which were not made by Mew).<br /><br />Nobody ever said that a game needed to exceed 3KB to be a success (although it is a requirement of Z2).  Nobody said that a game needed to let you move the player more than one time, either.  That's right, you move the player in this game a total of one time, but what an exhilarating one time it is.<br /><br />Didn't I mention the graphics this game possesses?  There's a fine looking chap with a red shirt and blue pants on, and for some reason his arm is made up of objects.  Why?  To up the filesize, no doubt.  To the right of the already excellent main feature is a road drawn with the word &quot;amusment&quot; beside it.  I am most certainly amused!  It doesn't matter that it makes no sense for a vertical road to be going up into the sky in the middle of a black void.  It's obviously amusing enough to stand alone.  It also doesn't matter that Mew misspelled &quot;amusement&quot; because this game rocks, and that's all that matters.  I'm not going to be a grammer Nazi here, folks.<br /><br />&quot;Finally! After all these years! I?ve reaserched how to make characters that talk in 3d!&quot; - Mew<br /><br />On to the main feature of the game.  The 3D talking.  Don't know what it means to talk in 3D?  Play this game to find out.  Granted, it's not a perfect example of 3D talking, but for a ZZT emulation of it, it's about as close as one could ever wish to get!<br /><br />&quot;it was truly the zzt-oop triumph of the decade&quot; - Nitr0 (Aka Stiltzkin)<br /><br />After moving one time you are allowed, you can then touch an object which makes a white object (the character's mouth) turn into #char 255 twice.  The game also makes two beeps, as the word &quot;Hello&quot; spouts from the mouth of the square headed character on the left side of the screen.<br /><br />This is nothing but pure brilliance.  It will forever change the way cinemas are made.  I don't know a single ZZTer who hasn't made use of the 3D Talk Engine.  As Mew tells us at the end of his 28KB .doc file, &quot;Don?t laugh at it, there will be better versions soon.&quot;  I don't think ANYBODY is laughing, Mew.  All I can hear is applause!  5/5."☃"1089928096"☃"3dtalk.zip"☃"5"☃"207.161.35.81"

"Mercenary, The"☃"Adamsk"☃"orochip_fish@yahoo.com"☃"First off, let me state that the relic system is awesome. But, it wouldn't be all that great if the experience system wasn't there as well. Both of these things make Mercenary a great game to play.<br />And though I think that the experience system was executed flawlessly do have a little problem with the relic system.<br />It became very apparent on my first run through the game exactly what path I would have taken if I had chosen the other relics. The game feels quite cramped when this happens and while I agree to some extent whith the other reviewer who thought that more than three relics would have been good, I think that having to choose one item over another would definately make this a better game.<br />For instance, if you don't choose, say, the Rope then every time you pass a Rope-accessable area you need to think. Okay, when I play the game again, when I choose the rope, I've got to remember this area. How the game is, however, you really don't need to backtrack all that often and there is no real need to play the game again with different choises. You can see everything and do everything on this first play though.<br />I do want to say again that I absolutely loved the battle and experience systems. The original enemies were quite nice. The only trouble I had in this respect was the dragon boss, who seemed to need a lot more ammo than was acutally given.<br />I do fully recommend The Mercenary for download and play. The loss of 1 point from a total of 5 was due to the cramped feel and completeness of doing everything in one play-though."☃"1091273401"☃"merc.zip"☃"4"☃"69.108.172.26"

"Well..."☃"Master Raze"☃"razerman@talk21.com"☃"I downloaded this game after Commodore mentioned it on the MIG forums. Anyway, this really isn't GTA, considering there are no cars to jack but that doesn't mean the game is shite, no, far from it. It's probably the most decent attempt at making a zzt version of the mighty Rockstar game. OK, it doesn't look pretty graphically but they are bearable and you can figure it out you're walking around in a city. There are buildings you can buy thus money has importance. Points I found to be useless though. Anyway, the gameplay was good for the most part but they do get incredibly repetitve. You know shoot, dodge, shoot gameplay which is SOO zzt. The game isn't exactly long. there are only two cities to explore and each ain't that big. 2-3 boards max. The cool thing about this game is its language. No, I ain't talking about the use of the F word, I mean that each character has its own voice. One may talk in an italian accent while some other character may talk like a rastafarian. You know what I mean. That actually livens up what may have been a boring read. So, I reckon that this game is worth the download. It's a fun game but not exactly bug-free. I reckon 3.5 is a good score. Capiche? Capiche."☃"1093708410"☃"GTAZZT.zip"☃"3.5"☃"195.92.67.66"

There's no real plot beyond do something, then go to another area and do something else, then go to another area and do something there... and of course, there are a lot of optional somethings you can do. GTA manages to pull this off by having the driving and stealing of cars be pretty freakin' fun, but walking an ANSI smile back and forth trying somehow to advance doesn't have the same ring to it.<br /><br />There was a lot of repetition in the types of missions you could do... pretty much coming down to &quot;shoot this&quot; &quot;find this&quot; &quot;F*** this&quot; or &quot;buy/sell this.&quot;<br /><br />The graphics were great, and the writing, while too full of intentional misspellings and swear workds to be excellent, succeeded in conveying the low-life mood so neccesary to the game.<br /><br />Once you completed a mission, you are only told once where the next one can be found, playing hell with anyone who dares save and come back to it. <br /><br />It's pretty buggy, and the fact that you could only do one mission at a time adds to the repetition.<br /><br />Still, I'm going to give it a reccomendation, if you like Raze's style, you'll like it, if you don't give it a try anyway... just don't expect Burger Joint-level simulation prowess."☃"1094438303"☃"ThugLife2.zip"☃"3.5"☃"205.188.117.5"

Yet, the game is just about saving your girl friend from the demonized enemies. The year is 2189. The city of Nipple has been redeveloped starting from 30 years ago, and there are 5 projects that are particularly prominent. You in the game happen to be a Nipple living in Anus form, yet without knowing it, you live in a rotten building and there is this doctor, Bigelow, who you really like. One day, he comes to you crying and asking for help to find his friend, who disappears with V-Birds right before his eyes like a mist. You then start the adventure with your doctor. Who is behind this but Bagstein, and this Bagstein who everyone knows is actually not human at all. He is a sentient doctor's bag who is planning to turn the Nipple world into his kingdom of monsters and devils. You come to know Camera J in your adventure, and other guys' help, you are able to recover your Nippleanus power and partial memory of your past. You then set off to fight that Bagstein who is holding on to your girl and is turning Nipple into a hellish place. However, when you have almost defeated him with all your guts and energy, you find out that this Bagstein is not a bad person in the beginning, and the guys who are helping you are not doing him justice actually. Moreover, you finally realize that you are only the 3rd generation of the Nipple you were told to be, and the 1st generation, that is, your Anus, is still living somewhere else and he is quite cruel with the subjects he has created and ruled... Confused eh? Anyway, that's the story and you aren't supposed to know all of these until the very ending of the game. That is, besides playing the game to save that doctor and get all the Z-Pictures, this long and boring plot is also what you get as a reward.<br /><br />The game play is real easy and there is only one ending! Being a ZZT game, the graphics were not that good and the music were also average done. The game has some very cute dialogs which is quite funny. There are no extras like cg, music room.<br /><br />There is a lot of extra buildings in the game that you need not go to but it gives you some Z-Pictures at the counter! The map is not very large and you should be able to navigate around easily as people in that town might give you some information on the various buildings.<br /><br />Overall, Nipple Saga is a good game.

"It tries so hard and gets so close."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"This game just missed the mark, except for some fatal bugs, and terrible spelling, this game could have probably been a winner.<br /><br />It starts out on top of a tree where you slowly remember you ate some sort of mushroom (called a pepper bolette) and ended up in this world. This is not your crazy world of mushroom houses, floating eyeballs, and a Bur-Lynn wall, instead it's basically like you standard zzt adventure setting, and the mushroom idea lets it get away with more.<br /><br />The story is limited and sparce, but it is filled with colourful characters who all speak with poor grammer and spelling. There were some &quot;dialects&quot; and accents used to make speech interesting, but it was hard to discern from actual grammatical error. Also Zephyre Syx needs to learn that footnote marks are placed at the ends of words. <br /><br />The most novel innovation is the backpack engine,which itself is a board accesable from any game board through a clever use of clones and passages. (Lots of passages!) Initially, the first time I used this engine (on the board I learned about it) I was returned to a board that I had not seen yet, and was stuck when I entered a passage and couldn't move due to a purple door. The system looks impressive, but other than the brief overview of its functions at the beginning of the game, there is nothing in the way of help, and it is not very easy to figure out how the whole thing works.<br /><br />The game is played at a faster speed than normal, and Zephyre Syx uses this feature well for gameplay, and also for  speeding up the process of duplicator/clone engines (which generally make noises throughout the game.) Very adventureesqe, with a good amount of combat, both melee and shooting. One of my gripes about gameplay is that supposed solid walls were sometimes made of water which could be shot through.<br /><br />Graphically the game has a good command of STK. There are plenty of fades and a lot of smudginess that will remind you of a Herc game. The font is a bit of a mystery, it seems it could have been used better. The smilies have been changed, which is good, and some chars were made specifically for the backpack engine, but the letters were hard on the eyes, dispite the fact only a few were changes (the s really was not pretty) and enemies still looked like pi and omega.<br /><br />What this game needs is a good overhaul. Or Zephyre Syx can move on, which would be fine with me, as this game is a good showing of things to come. "☃"1096603252"☃"BOLETTE.zip"☃"4"☃"68.186.246.151"

There are some very useful things here, ones that exploit the form of SZZT. I was particually impressed with the credits engine, which while simple, is very effective. The side scroller equally so, and with SZZT, it can actually be called a side scroller.<br /><br />It's very informative on the use of the Z flag, and tells how to make clever use of the Hint command. It also details a new message in SZZT :enter, which is sent when the player enters the board for the first time. On these cases, the encylopedia is very useful.<br /><br />Other such idea such as same board passages, are already common knowledge, but certainly help the beginner. The descriptions of some of the new features and monsters in SZZT is very sparce and not too informative. But then again, less is known about the game than ZZT. <br /><br />Still it's not very complete (as stated in the txt and file) and many things are horrible useless, such as the 3d engine which looks 10 times worse in szzt than it does in zzt.<br /><br />Dispite these flaws, The SZZT encylopdiea is useful. I would have like to see a toolkit, because dispite SZZT being able to make a lot more colour combinations, it still can't make them all. There really should be more, but I doubt we'll see it, so we've got to work with what we have.<br /><br />really it should be something like a 3.75, but my economics teacher tells me to round down..."☃"1096655723"☃"szztency1a.zip"☃"3.5"☃"68.186.246.151"
"A pound is like a 1000 ducks"☃"Zephyre Syx"☃"JurCeyad@aol.com"☃"When I crack open the case containing ThugLife2 (lets just pretend it does).  I wonder if the game live to it's expectations and worth a chunk of change it toke to get it.  It comes to find out, it more than expected, coming from &quot;razer&quot;.<br /><br />_Game Play_<br />FunFactor/Replay-If you like the previous ThugLife or GTA, Ew Luv thos.  With ribald humor, and at lease 30 missions and bunch of minigames to add to your toosie pop layers.  If that make your mouth water then start licking!!<br />Feature/Elements-As you start the game, you go around talking to contacts, or other fellas and get missions that can range from trying to find point b then go back to point a, to going inside building and cars and do whatever it needed to complete the mission.  While some seems repetitive, some do get you to do a little hand labor, and you got a niffty map &quot;poster&quot; and the tube stations to help out on your travels (not too much I'm afraid as one you needed to use the most is only two boards apart).  Some parts I do wish it tells you you're finish with the job, and give you a gist of what to do.  I guess with commodore the only playtester, not to many things you could spot for improvement.<br />Another feature is that you can buy building which can open up a minigame and a special mission.  And you got one place that generates cash if you just hang around there(a bit pointless to me).<br />I can't say I haven't played the minigame at the arcade once before in MasterRaze previous games, but for those who didn't, they're here.<br />Then there is this Sniping Mission created by &quot;amiga&quot;, heheh.  The unsteady nerve is a stroke of genius, but the engine is evilly flawed.  How?!  If you haven't use sights before in shooters, it won't be no problem, but for those who do, like mwa, then you know that the controls should be reversed (which ends up when you move left, the guy and desk runs off in the corresponding direction, which sounds retarded, and it is).  Alas, one can't think of everything.<br />Speed-Pysically okey.  It's how you go about in the game.  Either you go and complete all the job the game has to offer or you just complete the story missions.<br /><br />_Atmosphere_<br />Visual-*Gasp*No trademarked dark grey walls and building?!  Yay...no wait, spoke too soon.  Naul, really it pretty desent and are above AVERAGE.  Enough to tell where one thing is from another.<br />Sound/Music-Only the sound of opening doors, cracking necks, and gun fire.  Don't expect any jingles here.  Just turn on the radio.  Works wonders.<br />Imagetry-Bleh!!<br /><br />_Story_<br />You start out as KC, a regular thug going around, being thuggish, ruggish, sent by his former boss to a thuggish, ruggish city, to do some thuggish, ruggish jobs.  Not too much background here(HA! like you need them).<br /><br />If you don't mind the crude mature content which plagues all thuggish, ruggish games.  It's worth every penny. *wink*<br /><br />Off topic thought:  I wonder why all the thug rappaz didn't produce a game like GTA?  No, TrueCrime don't count."☃"1098368275"☃"ThugLife2.zip"☃"4"☃"152.163.101.5"
"Hmmm..."☃"Zephyre Syx"☃"JurCeyad@aol.com"☃"I was filling it, then it killed me at the end.  I guess I saw something that had potential that I thought the series is a good idea at first cause of the kroz-like gameplay (I have a sweetspot for puzzle/action/adventure, though there's little to no puzzle elements), then it got wickity wack on me towards the end.  * sigh * Improvements are needed cause I thought it was cool.<br /><br />The concept about adrenaline arcade is that each game in the series has a different senario, one game your job is to save your coworkers down deep in the caverns, another take place in the city, then on in fantasy world, and so forth, as you try to get a high score(too bad this generation don't believe in scoring(in that kinda way) anymore).<br />_Game Play_<br />Fun Factor-It the Scoring Type Game!  Each board you start on is a timed level you must complete, most you simply go to the exit trying not to get zapped back to start(losing a life), while other yields a simple engine.  Then after a certain amount of levels, you face a boss.  Sounds kinda so-so, and basic, but I know this can be something.  What exactly.<br />Features-Mind all the BICs you see throughout the game, there are few objects here and there if you notice them, like the boulder you have to out run(best using the mouse if yours work), and the bosses.  The levels are a little spaced, and straight foreward, leaving you a little option to just shoot a bunch of BICs and gather keys to get to the exit, leaving only some proving to be challenging.  The biggest killer is, get this, a star machine.  The Ultimate Machine at the end that will pumble you with stars.  It yells utter stupidity.  I can get &quot;only a few stars at a time&quot; that you'll be able to defeat it with minimal damage, but shilloads!?!  Now if the levels have a little more objectives to do before exiting, and that damned machine is demasculated, it'll be a tight game.<br />Speed-It flows right to the action, like what ARCADE genra should be.<br /><br />_Atmosphere_<br />Visual-The game doesn't stress on the graphics much (a lot of solid fills), only the environment changes in colour as you progress thought the levels.<br />Sound/Music-N/A Not enough to be notice.<br />Imagetry-&quot;As you walk into the room, you hear the voice of the man in the lower-right corner of the screen.&quot;  Well, he suceeded in making coke spew out my nose.<br /><br />_Story_<br />In this game, you're a worker and some jackass desided to sabotage the mines.  So now you got to find and rescue whoever's left in the mine and snap a log in between the traitor's arse.  The thing is...why?!?!?  It doesn't make any hellova sence just bl...bah!!!  Whatever.<br /><br />I might be giving it too much verbage then its worth, but I though I'll give it a chance. * shrugs"☃"1098368492"☃"adrenal1.ZIP"☃"2.5"☃"152.163.101.5"
"a very good try"☃"Zephyre Syx"☃"JurCeyad@aol.com"☃"Hey, I like this game.  It has love written all in it(or maybe I have played so much rpg/inventory/cinema games with whoop-di-do graphics and sound, anything different looks good).  Nah really, Casper's creative style is something not to be overlooked, and I like every bit of it.  Since I'm a puzzle/adventure loving audience, it gets a specious rating.<br /><br />_Game Play_<br />Fun Factor/Replay-If you love one-level world puzzle/adventure game that is a large enough to satisfy you, this is your game.  Though, the graphics might not be impressive at the beginning, the game play is the active element.<br />Features/Elements-You move through the castle with a bat and a gun of some sort, and bash anything that moves, namely robotz.  Though this is not the only thing you do.  You, of course, will have to solve a little puzzle here and there, and may have to backtrack to solve previous ones.  This game has all kinds of different types of robots, security systems, and dangers, so it won't get too tiring.  I went through the game just to find challenges, and non'of'em didn't disappoint me.  Some object programming uses the &quot;smack check&quot; pretty well,...well, exept the buzzsaws.  Just being at contact is deadly.<br />The vent section is the most impressive.  I never thought to use &quot;those things&quot; to create draft, I ENVY YOU!!<br />Speed-Game Play seem to slow down when it comes to backtracking to places you need to be.  A bit taxing.<br /><br />_Atmosphere_<br />Visual-Eww.  Red on grey solid-fill'd normals?!  The beginning part is what you have to worry about.  It's not wrong to use abstract colour for stage sections, ...itthedamnrightuglyones!!  Ex. Funky dark green and doo doo brown.<br />Sound/Music-The music is not included.  The sfx is simple and average.<br />Imagetry-Naul, there ain't nan.  It might not go together with the random coloured stages.<br /><br />_Story_<br />You're walter, a treasure hunter that kinda ran into the hide out of the notorious hacker Jasper, which happens to be inside of some dude's castle.  You have two objectives, find the treasure and straight jack homestyle that's running the place.<br />I don't judge story strongly in puzzle/adventure game.  It's the experience.  So...yeah, it's a go.<br /><br />I played both Rotten Robots and Revenge of the Ruffian, and I like the level layout and design in both the games.  It's very unique and I kinda wish I could just come up with stages just like that.  My mind works too complex for my own good.<br /><br />Hmmmm..."☃"1098368678"☃"rottenrobot.zip"☃"4"☃"152.163.101.5"

"and you shall know that I am the Lord"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"This game is pretty simple. There are no mazes, no puzzles, everything is _very_ straitforward. There's a lot you don't ever have to do.<br /><br />Basically it starts in an insane asylum where everyone breaks out and you have to track them down. Tracking them down involves going east and fighting tigers before finally getting to a cave where you face all the escapees one at a time in boss format after they have gained super powers from some sort of machine.<br /><br />Graphically the game is acceptable, with plenty of stk and a some decent fades. Gameplay wise it is rather weak. The only real challange is the boss fights (11 of them) at the end which make up the bulk of the playing time. These are not too hard (with one exception) as the  AI for the bosses is very lacking and most of the enemies are not very threatening.<br /><br />There is no music save the open bars of the power rangers theme.<br /><br />Overall it can waste an hour of your time, and if that's all you're looking for you should give it a try, but by no strech of the imagination is this going to stay on your HD for much longer than that hour.

"Robovine is Amazing"☃"ghettoflower"☃"viovis@sdf.lonestar.org"☃"This guy did things before we ever planned on them. His art was aweome, he used the bomb explosions + sliming over them to make exclusively random grass before we had pressing enter on 10 fakes and hitting capital F. A veteran user of the slime engine, he has created one of the greatest games i've seen in ZZT.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of RPG's and I liked this one. Plus there's a secret portal to a completely different adventure if you mess with the centipede head near the beginning just right. A nicely hidden part of the world indeed, jam packed high full of adventure and high sea... Another great thing about the robo is that he uses the Blinkity blink, but he uses it so nicely.

"score!"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"I like it. It's pretty, in an original way. Viovis's music really fits both the look and feel of the game very well. The RPG engine is pretty good too. Although there isn't much in the way of options. There are spells, items to use in battle, and of course the type of attack that misses often but hits hard. The story is good and has doses of humour.<br /><br />My only complaint are places where it says &quot;You walk for a while through the forest and kill a bunch of baddies to gain 200 exp!&quot; Which while I understand this sort of thing, it put me a little off.<br /><br />There are a wide varity of engines here, most of them are pretty good. The main attraction of course is the RPG one, but there are some other nice ones.<br /><br />And of course, as with many neat zzt games, this is part 1 of a multiple part story, so even if you beat it, there's nothing to do next :(<br /><br />It was fun "☃"1099486808"☃"udd.zip"☃"4.5"☃"68.186.246.151"
"Nasty Mr Smith"☃"TTTPPP"☃"TTTPPP123@hotmail.com"☃"That's a good play.  I'm not sure I can add much to what was said above - the graphics aren't superb, but they're not painful either.  It's set out in a similar style to GTA - you go somewhere and get given a mission, you complete it and get some cash, then you look for another mission, etc.<br />There are two cities, of which (in my oppinion) the first is better.  The first one is much more linear, but at least it has more 'purpose' to it (and less bugs to boot).  For instance, the library in the second city is a nice thought: you go there and learn some skill, and the idea is it will help you in the game.  However it's not really developed.  Similarly it's a nice idea that you can buy facilities in order to fund your illicit operations, but it doesn't really get developed either.  There are only two buildings for sale, and you make money by just standing next to them.  I appreciate that it probably boils down to the problem of the limit on global flags, but it would have been nice to have a more in depth engine to deal with facilities.<br />Anyway only spotted a few bugs (one of which denied me of 8000 bucks), and I enjoyed the writing so I give it a 4.<br />"☃"1099493708"☃"GTAZZT.zip"☃"4"☃"134.219.148.42"

"Indeed, but..."☃"Ender"☃☃"What is there to be said that hasn't already been said by our good friend Flimsy?  A lot, in fact.  He really missed the point of the game, at least as I saw it.<br /><br />The game begins with the cryptic message RISE AND ASSIMILATE THE DAY<br />RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.  It quickly becomes clear that this game will be played on many levels, most not on a plane you see in zzt games often.<br /><br />You play the role of Ebert, a suicidally depressed WWII vet centegenarian fighting a losing battle with not one but two diseases: Alzheimers and cancer of the body.<br /><br />The frantic red door is representative of Ebert's mix of dementias: He's trying to kill himself while fighting to stay alive against a tumor knawing away at his body.  The tesla coil in his bedroom represents the folly of youth.  The sad TV is a bitingly ironic symbol of the horror in the news and media today.  There is much more, but we won't get in to that.<br /><br />The story is touching: you'll want to laugh, cry, sneeze, fuck, and do miscellaneous other things whilst playing.  It's an emotional rollercoaster.<br /><br />There are many ways to go; you could go to the rumpus room, or the living room, or visit the Oval Office! (from the outside!)<br /><br />And there are gags too, such as be sure to check out the skeletons in Ebert's closet, or ZAP the door to the room in the upper right corner of the first screen and watch as hilarity ensues.<br /><br />the last act left me in tears: A runtime error in the living room, representative of good ol' Ebert's passing to the other side.  An abrutpt end to an altogether unforgettable game.  Bravo, Anonmonymous.  I salute you.<br /><br />Ps there is one complaint I have, however: the game is all too short.

"this game has too many positive reviews and i will"☃"Zenith Nadir"☃"napalmlachatte@gmail.com"☃"Chase Bramlage; the Rob Liefeld of ZZT.<br /><br />I'm sure he'd know what I'm talking about, if he saw this review; his games have always betrayed strong influence from 90's Image Comics to the point of near-plagiarism (his first game, for example, was called Boof, and was about a gerbil with telekinetic powers; I'm sure it's no relation at all to the now mostly-forgotten Todd McFarlane creation &quot;Boof and the Bruise Crew&quot; (the title character of which was also a mouse-like thing)), although I suppose that doesn't matter since it's only ZZT and, well, who cares who rips off what in these games?<br /><br />Back to the point; why do I call Bramlage the Liefeld of ZZT? Rob Liefeld, for those who don't know, was, if not the key proponent of it, certainly a major element of the style-over-substance, kewl, X-tryme, &quot;which superhero will die in this issue&quot;, exaggerated anatomy, 100 bad rip-offs of Wolverine/Lobo, gun-toting 'bad girl' garbage that most people think of when they consider the comic collector/speculator boom and bust of the 90's. Although this parallel is most evident in his game 'N-E-O' (in which every character seems to be a testosterone-sweating, hulking great caricature of the Liefeld creation Cable), Final Fantasy Disc 1 still has a lot to say for itself. Let's see.<br /><br />Graphics; While it's true that Chase can draw pretty well, he then goes and wastes this talent by using a technique that could generously be described as 'diffuse'; objects may be well drawn, it's just that you can't work out what the hell they are. The houses in the first village look like month-old horse turds with windows installed, and the floor texture in the castle looks like everything's been chewed up by a puppy yet to be housebroken. There's a lot to be said for simplicity, especially in something as graphically primitive as ANSI.<br /><br />In other words, top marks for style, minimum marks for technique. Just like Liefeld (but replace 'diffuse' with 'tiny ankles and swiss-cheese necks')!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Story; As has been discussed in depth by people who have actually played the damn game, this is a huge rip-off from Suikoden. As if stealing the name from a famous gaming franchise wasn't enough! I don't know much about Suikoden so I won't say anything else about that, though it goes without saying that Liefeld stole a lot of character designs from Marvel and DC during his tenure in Image (most notably Supreme, which Alan Moore later changed from a moronic, violent comic into something pretty awesome, but that's irrelevant).<br /><br />Programming; Oh hell, I can't really make any comparisons between Chase and Liefeld in this catagory, can I? Well, I'll just say the programming is shoddy and leave it at that, shall I? I suppose that's excusable since the game is blatantly unfinished, but there's no excuse for the dialogue. I'm no writer myself, but I could crap out better dialogue than this &quot;casual&quot; scene's;<br /><br />--<br />It is Devin Liukan, your childhood<br />friend, you haven't seen in years.<br />He rushes up to greet you. You both<br />embrace.<br /><br />Devin: &quot;Surprise, dear friend!&quot;<br /><br />You: &quot;What brings you to Stonegate?&quot;<br /><br />Devin: &quot;I was in town on business, and<br />I heard of your acquisition by the king.<br />-I have come to congratulate you..&quot;<br /><br />You: &quot;My friend, .. how long has it been?&quot;<br /><br />Devin: &quot;Three years I believe..&quot;<br /><br />You: &quot;You still studying to be a thief?&quot;<br /><br />Devin: &quot;Still studying?! Hell I'm the teacher now!&quot;<br /><br />You both laugh.<br />--<br /><br />That is the funniest joke in the game. See what he did there?! As can be inferred from the dialogue, all the characters talk the same and there's really no characterisation; Devin is The Friend who accompanies you on your quest, Cleo is Your Sister (who annoyingly says &quot;Father&quot; or &quot;Brother&quot; at the end of seemingly every sentence she speaks), your Father is Stern, etc. These are archetypes, not personalities, which would be fine if there was at least an attempt at some sort of development; but it never comes.<br /><br />As an aside, an odd quirk of Chase's that I've noticed on editing his work is how his commands all seem to have something to do with excrement; ':poop', ':shit', ':crap', etc. It's nothing significant, I'm just mentioning it as yet another possible parallel to Liefeld's propensity have his characters say 'shit' frequently. However, there are not enough references to blood in the code for this to be a major point (Bloodlines has 'blood' in the title though, I suppose that counts).<br /><br />-<br /><br />And it's awesome that Chase has only ever finished one project (ie. Bloodlines; I suppose I've no room to talk, I've not touched any aspect of Frost, in ZZT or otherwise, for months), again just like Rob Liefeld!! Holy shit, it's like they're the same person! I'm surprised Chase never tried to release his ZZT games with multiple title screens (one of which would, of course, be somehow covered in some kind of holofoil crap)!<br /><br />Of course, taking the parallel to its conclusion, Final Fantasy Disc 1 has become the butt of a lot of jokes, just like Youngblood did. Ha ha.<br /><br />In conclusion, stop giving this game good reviews, you idiots. If you can't live without a good fantasy ZZT game, go play a good game like Ned the Knight; the graphics may not be as kewl and extreme as FFD1, but it's got soul, which is an element absent from 90% of Chase's output.<br /><br />0/5. I'd give it 0.5/5 but I feel a deep and abiding need to lower the score some more from those positive reviews.<br /><br />-zn<br /><br />ps. i sure do hope chase reads this and calls me a grade-schooler! it would be the highest honour ^___^"☃"1110759242"☃"ffdisc1.zip"☃"0"☃"138.253.161.186"

"An A for effort but..."☃"Smiley19"☃☃"Well, here's some context boys - Freedom, for a ZZT game, had some massive hype behind it. It featured music by Kevin Carter, aka Kev-san, who was a 13 year-old musical prodigy. It was also announced during a brief high in &quot;Classy, deep, meaningful&quot; ZZT games spearheaded by Anthony Testa, aka Shigesato, who would later provide the kick-ass graphics to Freedom. The main selling point was the fact that it was a Rock Opera done on ZZT with music by Kev-san. On paper, it looked like a hit.<br /><br />But... let me give some history here<br />I was good friends with Kev, so I could tell you that Freedom was mulling over in his head for a very long time. However, Kev is, IMHO, a better composer than writer, and it shows. Many ideas were basically lifted straight from the classic novel The Giver along with little drops of the darker 1984 - Small community, protagonist with some sort of undefined specialness, evil government and an overall sense of oppression with a tender love story attached. Okay, sure. Not very creative, but I'm sure that part of Kev's reasoning to make Freedom a musical was because you can get away with unoriginality in a musical so long as your music is good.<br /><br />Uhh...almost.<br /><br />Now, despite some of these other reviews, some of the music is pretty kickass. There used to be a CD Kev had which contained all the music using synthesized instruments and I can tell you from what little I heard, the music kicked ass before being butchered into this.<br /><br />In detail -<br /><br />1) Overture - YES! YES! This is great...the intro with our protagonist falling and this wonderful music going at insanely fast speeds.   It's fast-paced and epic, yet dark. This is Kev at his finest, where the PC speaker sounds like an actual instrument.<br /><br />War - Uhh..no. Total 180 from the beginning. Seems to be going for a jazzy feel at first, but then it just devolves into some tuneless mess with some drum work that doesn't sound half as good as it should. The lyrics are also kinda bleh.<br /><br />Decision - The evilll elders are meeting. Great, simple yet stylish graphics are present here with a pretty decent sound. The lyrics aren't too bad either and there is a fuckin' awesome 'solo' in the middle which again shows why Kev was so sought after for projects. Fairly good.<br /><br />(I forget the rest of the titles here so..)<br /><br />Birth - Yeah, our hero is born to some mediocre writing and composition which, while adequate, didn't translate into ZZT very well. I'm sure Kev meant this to have lots of symbolism with stuff like &quot;wrapped in fleece,&quot; but it all falls flat. The art is not that great either.<br /><br />Micah's Angsting - Okay, so our hero was put into a home for the retarded to stop his powers from taking over the Elders. Right... Kev really seems to want to make this be a Pink Floyd The Wall esque moment...but. No. Tune is forgettable and the lyrics are, again, flat. Shigesato did some nice graphics for this one though.<br /><br />So he goes outside FOR THE FIRST TIME EVAR.<br /><br />Love Song - Right, you met this chick. She's all cool and into you. You're both rebels and she's a REVOLUTIONARY VIVA ZAPATA. Sorry, but this story is going nowhere. Okay, they kiss and run off into the forests. Lyrics here are simply wretched (sorry Kev) and the graphics make Rina look retarded herself. Tune is rather catchy though.<br /><br />Ending music - beautiful. Expands on the tune of the overture and takes it into an almost apocalyptic direction. It's wonderful and causes one to think of What Could've Been if the story had been expaned upon the lyrics refined to exude the class that Shigesato so desperately wanted ZZT to have.<br /><br />And then it just drops us, DO THEY *REALLY* live Happily Ever After or DID THEY JUST SCREW THEMSELVES OVER!?!<br /><br />Sadly, it could've been interesting to see Rina's revolutionary personality taken deeper - why is she fighting? What is Jorosh the elder really up to? What's so damn special about Micah? <br /><br />Sadly, none of this will ever be found out. Kev intentionally made his ending ambiguous out of keeping things &quot;open to interpretation.&quot; The only problem is that he should've made a story that was interpretable in the first place. As it stands, we're left some pretty incomprehensible symbolism, athmospheric graphics with no athmosphere, music that's up and down and then some. Yeah. Admittedly Kev had alot of frustration over this one, but he should've kept at it in some spots. Oh well.<br /><br />A 4 for nostalgia from talking with Kev at 1am about preteen angst when I was 14. 2.5 for actual quality."☃"1112767527"☃"freedom.zip"☃"2.5"☃"172.195.145.118"
"Kind of like a Darkthrone album."☃"Ma&eth;Tom"☃"madtom@gmail.com"☃"You know, this used to be my favourite ZZT game, even after playing the requisite Zenith Nadir and drac0 classics that comprised my earlier obsessions. Of course, back then I was trying to stake some sort of claim as a ZZT musician, and I suppose I must have thought that, much like some indie rock kiddie, a good way to get one's name in the open was to idolise something almost nobody else seemed to really like.<br /><br />Translating anything symphonic - or beyond two instruments, really - in ZZT is not an easy task. I've been there. For half of the projects the wise musician will realise about halfway through that this simply isn't working, that even alternating notes just doesn't make it sound right. I've dumped plenty of tracks that way. kev takes on the (in my opinion) insurmountable task of doing this with ONE track of sound. Bluntly, I wouldn't even &lt;I&gt;entertain&lt;/I&gt; the idea of doing this, and given kev's ambitions I think it's been done very well.<br /><br />While I am not surprised to learn from the previous review that kev-san was or is regarded as a musical prodigy in the vein of Mooseka, &lt;I&gt;Freedom&lt;/I&gt; just doesn't work. Grainy Testa graphics with no playability, a remarkably brief story with vague utopian connotations, a hollow love-interest, topped off with the wails, squeals and buzzes of a minor-key track - no matter how good music and the story behind it is, you cannot convey it in its full glory through a beeping PC speaker. kev himself acknowledges this in the editor notes.<br /><br />This is why I now firmly believe that the idea of a ZZT musical just isn't going to work. It really didn't even work with &lt;I&gt;The Rose&lt;/I&gt;, and that's WiL, for crying out loud.

"what? no grapes of wrath?"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"In this game you play the loveable retard, George, a big strong man who has nothing to say on the topic of rabbits. You're helping Tom, your abusive buddy, to find his mother. Odd that the game is subtitled: Tom's Adventure, as you are doing most of the leg work, shooting things (every huge mentally handicaped person should own a gun!) and solving a few rudimentary puzzles, including slider puzzle that slider rookies should be able to muscle through.<br /><br />Let's get the bad out of the way first.<br />There are a few hangups in gameplay. I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to move the &quot;heavier&quot; set of boulders. (You'll see if you play.) They were punished with a good strong ZAP. Another hangup, not so much in the beginning or middle of the game as the end, is the lack of ammo. This can be blamed on an oversight on my part, as I did not stock up before heading to the next city, but I did expect another city to have another store. Ammo shortages are mainly a problem when you try and blast your way through dense &quot;forest&quot; but obviously it was an intentional decision.<br /><br />The graphics ranged from stylistically minimalist, to lazily sparce and hurried. The city especially looked good, as did the sewers in the city. Some forest boards looked like forests, others looked like black paths through a green field. I liked the title screen, it was retro and appropriate.<br /><br />There is no music in the game. Sounds were limited mainly to what sounds ZZT normally makes.<br /><br />The writing is hard to discuss. There are some rather eyebrow raising and vulger things thrown in loosely among most of the game's (excuse this expression please) comedic retard-banter. Some there are several points where Tom's homophobia is highlighted, and also his brutality to George. Overall its an intriguing mix that will have you smiling one second and gritting your teeth the next.<br /><br />With all that out of the way: The game was pretty fun, nothing real new, but its always good to peer into the depths of anothers sould.

Four seasons revival is not only the best ZZT game remake of all time, it is one of the best ZZT games, period.  Some minor bugs very rarely make gameplay impossible, but like most of the games in this list, I was looking at concept, not delivery.

Of those I have selected just 66 to be included in my list of &quot;best ZZT games ever.&quot; <br /><br />One of these is &quot;Aliens&quot;, a distinctly ancient game without much in the way of graphics and programming.  Perhaps most of the mojo of this game is unintentional; i would not be surprised if it was.  You are a soldier fighting (Aliens.), so we're told by the king.  the game starts with an enigmatic &quot;What am i doing here?&quot; which could have been uttered by your character, one of the king's talking guards, or the narrator's eye now cast upon this unlikely hero, or intended to be uttered by you, the player, upon entering this gameworld.  When you and your fellow soldiers are lined up in front of a bunch of aliens, the weapons of your compatriots are wholly ineffective - you must go in, guns blazing, only 50 ammo and a lot of scum to kill.  The gameplay is much like any newbie game thereafter, with the strange addendum of people shouting catchphrases at you at every turn, things like &quot;what you see is not what you think&quot; when traversing a mountain range or &quot;we are counting on you to kill their leader&quot; when their 'leader' appears to be noting more than a bunch of discombobulated centipede segments.  Perhaps if mr miller has played through his game even once, or had worked on it a bit more or been exposed to other games by which he could benchmark his own, we would not have this splended gem of oddness.  I like it because it pays attention to the things that are important - giving the king a name, giving the soldier's story some attention beyond the introduction, giving us more during and even after the ass kicking ensues - while paying no attention whatsoever to those things which one would expect to pay attention to when making a game; do my objects do what they're supposed to do?  Does the layout of my boards make any visual sense?<br /><br />I hope beyond anything that games like this are somewhere, somehow, being made deliberately - with a little attention this game could be a classic gem, as is, it still shares the spotlight as one of the best zzt games ever."☃"1115376010"☃"aliens.zip"☃"3"☃"12.202.241.141"

Its near the begining so it's not hard to fix.

"Pirate Perils"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"Are there any pirate games in ZZT? Outside of this one? If so let me know, but if not, this will have to satisfy your swashbuckling needs for the time being. <br /><br />Made in 1995 (as I gather from the file date) this game is pretty generic, but still somehow appealing. I think its the pirate aspect, and the fact that the designer knows how to use flags appropriately. He execute some of the basic ZZT tricks, stuff you just plain wouldn't see if no effort was put into the game.<br /><br />There is no STK in the game, but you'll be running around for the most part on yellow fakes. You see your ship has crashed on a island and it's your job to get it fixed, which somehow has to do with destroying a volcano god. It's not very clear, but along the way you'll fight various other pirates with colourful names like Cyanpants, and sea monsters. All the bosses excluding the last pirate and last monster are pretty easy, but still can hit you a few times, which is a problem, seeing as health is pretty limited in the game. The main difficulty of the last two bosses comes from their star throwing. Which isn't overwhelming for the most part. (Although it seems so on the last boss, his various parts that you kill will reduce the number he throws. I beat him in a few tries with 160 health, 10 remaining afterwards.)<br /><br />Most of the enemies are prefabs, although there are a few number of object enemies later.<br /><br />An interesting feature of the game is setting the difficulty, which will adjust how much health and ammo you have at the beginning of the game.<br /><br />So c'mon! Kill some ruffians, swashbuckle some pirates, slay some sea monsters, save a princess, and join me for adventure on the high seas!

It feels uninspired.<br /><br />Oh, and I think there's a bug near the end, since I played through the whole damn game and made it back to the castle to share the knowledge of the evil plot I had learned, and no one said anything beyond the &quot;Good luck!&quot; I got when I first left.

"Fun with Joe."☃"EuphoriaZZTer"☃"nickofurr@yahoo.com"☃"This game is probably the best in having no bugs (that I could find).  This is also one in which you mainly play as Joe, instead of Asher.  I really love the storyline as well.  The whole plot is based on Time Travel.  I would definitly have to say that this is one of the best games I played.  I don't normally give games a five unless they deserve it.  If you play the whole series, starting with 1, then you really get hooked.  Even though this is more laid back than the others, the puzzles are harder, and some are even more fun.  However, as good as this game is, it does have it's cons.  Here's a breakdown:<br /><br /><br />Sound: 5/5<br />You never hear sound if you don't need to, no annoying music while you are playing the level, and in my opinion, perfectly timed.<br /><br />Graphics: 4.9/5<br />This was one of the only downfalls.  On the Panaxis, the white door nearest to the key dispenser is hard to see.  Of course, if you touch everything, then it is quite easy, but for &quot;thinkers&quot; it doesn't quite work.<br /><br />Mobility: 5/5<br />Yes, there are some tight spaces, but unless I was getting keys, I never had to move too much.  There was that one maze, but it added to it, rather than detracted from it.<br /><br />Spelling: 5/5<br />This is one of the two games I've played that has no spelling errors.  It has one grammatical error, but it was small.<br /><br />Programming: 4.9/5<br />This is the only other downfall in the game.  With one object, (and only one, thank goodness) you could not get the Yellow key if you touched it from behind.  It said that you had gotten it, but you didn't.  I loved the usage of real doors, rather than having to program all of them.<br /><br />Playability: 5/5<br />This game is completely playable, no matter what you do, unless of course you get trapped in a minigame.<br />In fact, one you are inside the Panaxis, you can't die!<br /><br />Overall: 5/5<br />There are only two games that I hve played that I could play over and over again.  Those two games are ESP, and this one.<br /><br />Closing remarks:<br />We all have our problems, but Chronos30 is one of the few people that learns from them.  I never saw a mistake in a previous part repeated in any of the following parts.<br />Last but not least, I wish this series would never truly end.

All the information is good, if not a little biased. (I like stars!) Still, it does what it promises. ZZT Syndromes is dated, but it is still essential, this is not so much a replacement (I do mean to suggest it was intended to be) but a good &quot;chapter 2&quot;<br /><br />While it tries to do the things Syndromes did, occasionally placing the player in hated situations as examples of what not to do, it doesn't do it enough, and often resorts to explaining what should or should not be done. I can't really complain about that too much, especially when it talks about things beyond the realm of the visual.<br /><br />Its a welcome &quot;chapter 2&quot;. It is a little off puting coming from Kjorteo, who I've not yet seen a game from, but there are plenty of ZZT players out there who know what they like.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is not very big... The whole thing seems a little short. I would like to see Kjorteo maybe continue to update this utility. Hopefully he'll get more feed back than just mine and Will's.<br /><br />So take your grain of salt and give it a whirl."☃"1119160576"☃"zztpro.zip"☃"4"☃"68.186.246.224"

I shall check this out.&quot; Then i saw the game. Many ZZT games have great soundtracks, even for PC speaker. This game had hardly any music except the title screen's, which is just fine, but the sound effects whisper to you, &quot;Press the B button... press the B button...&quot;. And the engine in general sucked. Whenever you would do anything in midjump, you start falling. I know many platformers do this, and I totally hate it. The only time this kind of engine should be used is when it is a base for a much better jumper. And the shooting system? Pffff. Using a text box to ask the direction is the WORST way to do shooting in a jumper. Oh yes, I forgot, the plot. What plot? I couldn't even find the plot. To the rating:<br /><br />GAMEPLAY: 1/5<br />It was effective, but nowhere near effective enough. The crappy engine made the difficulty ridiculously hard, along with trying to time the shooting.<br /><br />PLOT: 0/5<br />What plot?<br /><br />MUSIC: 2/5<br />The only thing that I could find that was good, and there wasn't much of it. And the sound effects made by DJ were quite annoying by ZZT standards.<br /><br />OVERALL: 1/5<br />Don't get this unless you like those horrible jumper engines, and are obsessed with Mario."☃"1121812712"☃"marioss.zip"☃"1"☃"71.208.225.12"

"Nicely done."☃"Quantum"☃"cipher110@yahoo.com"☃"&lt;i&gt;ZZT Pro&lt;/i&gt; is a very nice set of lessons on problems to avoid when writing ZZT games. A lot of it is common sense to non-newbies and has appeared before in &lt;i&gt;ZZT Syndromes&lt;/i&gt; (its predecessor), but it contains a few tips that anyone can consider and some material that is updated/new.<br /><br />A fair amount of the content is opinion. However, I do not think this detracts significantly from &lt;i&gt;ZZT Pro&lt;/i&gt;, as it is just as valuable to hear the likes/dislikes of a fellow ZZTer as it is to be preached objective fact. Kjorteo even stated himself that his suggestions are not absolute, just ideas to be taken into consideration. As a result, I have no complaints on this point.<br /><br />A couple of lessons did not seem thoroughly discussed. For example, the section on guarding against cheating left out a couple of methods that have already been described in the &lt;i&gt;ZZT-OOP Encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt;. I also agree with Commodore to a certain extent that there could have been a tad more content. However, these are not significant concerns, as long as you don't consider this to be the 100% comprehensive guide to everything ZZT.<br /><br />Finally, the bulk of the content mostly applies only to newbies; I was hoping for something even more advanced, perhaps more tutorials on psychology, creating balanced gameplay, etc... Still, this is a valuable resource for a newcomer.<br /><br />Conclusion: A very good update to &lt;i&gt;ZZT Syndromes&lt;/i&gt; that could have been ever-so-slightly better.

Is it just me, or when people fight these days [i'm talking a punch up], are people to scared to fight fairly? I've noticed this [personally], when someone has a problem with me [not like online insults, as in off the internet], and wants to come get me, i hate fighting, but i do so when absolutly nesesary, they allways appear [even when they'll have no problems beating the shit out of me] to come in a group of at least 3 against 1. Last week, I'd been down my Grandma's, trying to fix her printer, and I was going home, i took a shortcut though Hylton Castle dene, a small part of woodland, seperating Hylton Redhouse [the estate where i live] from castletown, with a small stream running through it, when i was going to take a detour, to the retail park, as one of the stores was having a special offer, when i noticed a large group of teenagers about to cross the stream (20 of em, all between 14-18), i was up the hill, about to come down, when i decided to take a rest, so i sat on a bench. One of them spots me, shouts something, i wasn't paying atention, then i caught part of it 'Get the fuck out of these woods, you've got no fucking right to be down here Redhouser or we'll rip your balls off.' I'm not stupid, so i left, as a matter of fact, I left quickly with the bastards comming after me, hopped over the castle walls, to Wear View housing estate. But here's a good question, what right does anyone have to declair a part of woodland their turf? Why do people allways fight dirty? My good for nothing brother picked a fight with me after he'd had a drink, and a lost my temper, and lashed back at him [I really lost it their, cos he'd kick my arse 7 times before i'd hit the ground] and he claimed it was dirty to hit from behind, so it isn't dirty fighting when you know fine well whoever you're fighting can't fight back? In this bastard world, the arseholes allways seem to win."☃"1128395651"☃"wer.zip"☃"5"☃"64.126.129.109"

"very welcome"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"This trippy adventure is nothing very new, but is it executed well and the programming is tight. The story is convoluted, with absurdity and cameos giving the abstraction a funny feel. The curse machine(?) made me laugh. The graphics are nice, a little heavy on the blue, but it's a stylistic choice. In general the gameplay is hard, the logic of using items (?+i) is sometimes easy, but often not. I zapped my way through the last few doors, but that was because I didn't realise that the game was almost over. There is very little sense of climax at the end, the passage you take seems like it should just take you to another room.<br /><br />Still, a welcome adventure game from an already accomplished ZZTer.

"A masterpiece."☃"Anonymous"☃☃"The grand-daddy of all frustrating puzzlers, and arguably rei-chan's finest work (even finer than Code Red). It's also unique as there are even red herring items in the game, possibly hinting it was planned to be much longer. There is so much packed into this baby that three of the boards exceed 19K, and one exceeds 18K!<br /><br />People have complained about the ridiculous difficulty of Mission: Enigma (especially the final board), and few have beaten it without cheating. Below is a complete walkthrough.<br /><br />It's without a doubt the best 10-board game (12 after title screen and ending) ever made, although it's a shame that the plot wasn't more fleshed out, possibly because rei-chan didn't want to risk runtime errors. It still deserves a 5/5.<br /><br />WALKTHROUGH<br />Steps starting with the word SAVE require precision timing. If you mess up, you won't get a second chance. Most importantly, do not waste your ammo!<br /><br />PART I - MAIN FLOOR<br />1. SAVE. Hide north of the bush until the sentry goes to sleep. Enter the fortress.<br />2. Read the DOS 9.12h manual. Enter the southwest room.<br />3. SAVE. Stand a bit away from the knife trap. Activate it, then step out of the way and touch it from the north or south as it flies toward you.<br />4. Shoot an empty bottle (ammo=5). Pick up the shard.<br />5. Enter the southeast room. Touch the guard to stab him. Grab both items on his body. Unlock the door he was guarding and enter the basement.<br />6. Light a torch. Ignore the oil barrel and bucket (red herring) and keep walking ahead. Touch the guard to stab him. Grab both items on his body. Pull the bar to the right and walk west. Set AC to maximum. Turn off the water valve. Walk west to see a left bucket. Move that bucket three spaces east so that it's aligned with the straight pipe section jutting out of the wall. Shoot the straight pipe section (ammo=4).<br />7. SAVE. Turn on the water valve, then immediately turn it off. Pick up the bucket filled with water. Return to the main floor.<br />8. Pick up the ammo in the southwest room (ammo=6). Enter the northwest room. Ignore the bottle of red wine (red herring).<br />9. SAVE. Shoot the east air duct (ammo=5). It might take a couple of tries to get this, but don't use more than 2 ammo to do it. This walkthrough will assume you destroyed it using one shot. Enter the north room.<br />10. Push the crate so that it's adjacent to the air duct, destroying it. Enter the northeast room with the crate.<br />11. SAVE. Shoot the air duct (ammo=4).<br />12. SAVE. Move the mirror east, then north so that it's positioned at the northeast corner. Do not slam it against the wall or else it will break!<br />13. Exchange the diamond on the pedastal with the ruby ring. Fire the lazer. Touch the flames to douse them with your water bucket.<br />14. Push the crate so that it's west of the lower part of the spring. Activate the spring, then push the wall back. Push the crate one space west to destroy the air duct. This will move the crate one space north. Now push the crate all the way to the end of the hallway and destroy that air duct. The crate will then move one space south due to the explosion.<br />15. Push the crate east to where the air duct in the southeast room once was, then walk around and push the crate north. Now you can push the crate into the west room. There are a couple of things to take care of before you do that, though.<br />16. Walk outside and pick up the clay. Enter the blue passage, light a torch, and pick up the gloves. Walk out and re-enter the fortress.<br />17. Re-enter the basement via the southeast room. Light a torch if necessary. Cover the punctured water pipe with the clay, then turn on the water valve. Return to the main floor.<br />18. Use the crate to destroy the air duct in that room, then push it into the north room and onto the right panel. Now you can enter the second floor!<br /><br />PART II - SECOND FLOOR AND COMMTHOUGHT<br />19. Here is the electric maze solution. When you solve it, enter the north passage:<br />A. Center room: Press<br />B. Left room: Middle, left, right<br />C. North room: Left, right<br />D. Left room: Middle<br />E. Right room (3 buttons): Left, middle<br />F. Far right room: Press<br />20. Press the switch, then enter CommThought.<br />21. Clear the rubble. Walk over to the green defensive chip, making sure not to touch anything else! The right section of the defensive chip will have a panel. Open it and grab the silver key. Leave.<br />22. Re-enter the second floor and unlock the silver door. You'll end up in the basement again after going through a series of passages. Light a torch, then make a note of the manual override code. Leave and re-enter CommThought.<br />23. All of the purple buttons have a letter designation. Press them in the exact order of the manual override code. The forcefield should lower. Fix the electric wire break, then leave.<br />24. Press the switch and enter the green room to play GEMini.<br />25. SAVE. Defeat CommThought at GEMini. The general strategy is to move pieces 1 and 2 towards the center. Once you do that, it will be impossible for CommThought to win.<br />26. Enter the passage to the right of CommThought to get one ammo (ammo=5). Attempt to enter the left passage, then quickly touch the blockade. Once Karen finishes casting Levitate, enter the passage.<br />27. SAVE. RUN!!!<br /><br />PART III - BOSS FIGHT AND CAVERN OF ILLUSION<br />28. SAVE. Don't attack Karen or Maleen. Instead, shoot Dr. Kris up to five times by continually touching your console, then finish him off with a melee attack. Once you control Karen, alternate casting spells against the demon and melee attacking the demon on your end. You should deal damage faster than Maleen can heal. When you win, head north to enter the hardest section of the game.<br />NOTE: If you're not fast enough and Karen dies, you won't get the extended ending.<br />29. SAVE. Be quick, as you'll need every last bit of that time! Grab the three visible rocks (ammo=3). Position yourself so that you're south of the right dragon, then touch it twice. As it opens its mouth, move away and it should shoot south to reveal another rock. grab it (ammo=4).<br />30. SAVE. Talk to Karen to get her out of the way. Face west of the right dragon and touch it. Step away and it should destroy the left dragon. Touch its remains to grab the golden key. Touch its remains again so that it moves aside. Walk on the space where it used to be, then touch the west wall to pick up a hidden rock (ammo=5). Unlock the door.<br />31. SAVE. Carefully shoot the snakes, as you can only afford one shot for each of them (ammo=3). Unlock and enter the room to the north.<br />32. SAVE. Here is the solution to the Music-Lock combonation [sic] room. The numbers represent equivalent positions on a clock. 12 is the north door, and 6 is the south door. There is no 3, 6, or 9.<br />A. 11, 5, 8<br />B. 11, 5, 2, 11, 5, 7<br />C. 2, 11, 5, 11, 5, 8, 11, 5, 2<br />D. 11, 5, 1, 4, 10, 4, 11<br />When you clear the room, you should have at least 140 ticks remaining on the clock. If you don't, you won't have enough time to escape. Head north.<br />33. SAVE. There is a suspicious piece of the wall sticking out. Shoot it, making sure that there is a one space gap for it to register (ammo=2). It should turn into a boulder. Push that boulder two spaces west so that it's out of the way.<br />34. Unlock and enter the west room (the one with the triangle things). Those triangles are stalactites. Shoot the rightmost one from the south, again making sure that there is a one-space gap (ammo=1). It should fall one space south and turn into a boulder.<br />35. Push that boulder east. Open the door to the east room, then push the boulder east so that it dislodges the key from the pedestal and takes the place where the key once was. Grab the key, then turn the water valve on and off.<br />36. Go back into the north room and shoot east into the river (ammo=0). This will reveal a secret room. Use the lettered buttons to change the white door into the matching door of your key. Each letter represents a different color.<br />37. Once that's done, hurry through the colored door and out of the fortress! You win!"☃"1138712916"☃"enigma.zip"☃"5"☃"216.99.61.30"
"Island of ZZT"☃"Quantum P."☃"christophermounce@gmail.com"☃"At first glance, &lt;i&gt;Island of ZZT&lt;/i&gt; isn't too impressive; it just looks like the average ZZTer's first game. However, when I played the game, I noticed a few things that make me think that Ajc1490 has a bright future in the ZZT world.<br /><br />The graphics, although primitive, improve throughout the game. Many of the boards show use of textures; for example, the sand has a random appearance, there are waves in the water, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;... The pathways have wavy, flowing shapes, fitting the natural settings of the beach and the woods. Palm trees and thick vines give the player some scenery to look at. The dark cellar was especially well-done. It was very simple, but the dark colors chosen did a good job of theming the area, and the bones and blood were a nice touch! For a beginner, these are graphics to be proud of, and I encourage Ajc1490 to keep developing his style.<br /><br />The gameplay of &lt;i&gt;Island of ZZT&lt;/i&gt; reminds me of older ZZT games. Most of the monsters in the game are the built-in lions, tigers, bears, and centipedes, which aren't used that much in modern games; there could have been more object enemies. The game is easy and not terribly innovative by today's standards, but it can be seen that some thought went into the game. One of the things that struck me was the dying man in the native village. The typical ZZT cliche for giving the player money is to have a an unexplained stash of gems. Instead, in this game there is some explanation for the money; the dying man, reflecting on the fact that earthly riches mean nothing in the afterlife, gives you his money.<br /><br />&lt;i&gt;Island of ZZT&lt;/i&gt; is not an epic, groundbreaking game, but it does have a certain charm to it. As Ajc1490 improves as a programmer, I believe that he will go on to create some very good games. I hope to see more of his work in the future!"☃"1140486052"☃"Island.zip"☃"3"☃"140.142.173.15"
"Whoa."☃"My Liver Hurtz"☃"myliverhurtz@3web.net"☃"I heard FYNDR's request for a review of this game, so, I decided to take a gander at it. I wasn't expecting very much... but, thankfully, I got more than I was expecting. This game is by no means an awful newbie game, instead, it was an enjoyable one. Granted, I haven't played much ZZT in the past few years and I'm just getting back into the swing of things now.<br /><br />The graphics were very, very simplistic, so not many marks there. Where my score of 2.5 comes from is the concept and the humour. The concept could have been executed much more, but, FYNDR more than displays enough potential to create some very trippy and intriguing game concepts.<br /><br />The atmosphere of Lucidity from the title screen is in tune with the rest of the game. The odd man out is the opening board which sets a darker, more serious tone that I would've preferred been explored, that I thought opened up a lot of possibilities for a great game.<br /><br />So, I was a bit disappointed by the typical ZZT going-ons with this game. The humour, though, for some reason really got me. &quot;Hot dogses&quot; and the hot dog stand spontaniously collapsing made me laugh a lot more than they should have. I suppose it's just because it doesn't take itself too seriously... granted, 99% of ZZT games don't, but, this one took another route in the humour which I can't quite pin. FYNDR's humour is more defined in Agent Blue, I believe.<br /><br />Anyways, Lucidity is a nice diversion. I enjoyed playing it, though, it is familiar ground. Very familiar ground.<br /><br />What I'd love to see is for FYNDR to hone in on his particular sense of humour and style of storytelling and be less general. I'll discuss this more in my review of Agent Blue."☃"1140729218"☃"lucidity.zip"☃"2"☃"199.243.20.27"
"Promising"☃"My"☃"myliverhurtz@3web.net"☃"I found this game to be more enjoyable than Lucidity. The story is less promising, but, it gives what it promises. The graphics leave much, much to be desired, and there's very, very, very little innovation in terms of gameplay.<br /><br />I said I'd concentrate on his humour for this review, though, so I will. FYNDR incorporates tried-and-true ZZT humour and cliches into this game. It gives it a very, very generic feel. Where I sense a difference, though, is in a few key moments of pure hilarity. The ones I can remember the most, since I haven't finished the game, are of the first level on the Cuban superjet. After breaking out of a jailcell (get used to this) your partner in jailbreaking gets mowed down by a million guys with guns. Then, simaltaniously, they all run out of ammo and retreat before seeing you. Your partner's staggered back with blood dripping on the floor. It's really, really, really funny. Then there's the plumbing system placed right where you need it, where you can overhear the enemy giving you a secret to be found in there. It's just funny.<br /><br />The reason I gave this a higher score than I normally would is because of that promise of humour which I don't tend to see in ZZT games. Then again, I don't tend to play too many newbie games, so, it might not be all that original. In any case, I think FYNDR shows incredible promise. If he can drop generic humor and clicheic gameplay and focus in on his own particular brand of funny and model his gameplay after it - with good graphics - I can see myself really, really enjoying one of his creations."☃"1140729646"☃"agentblue.zip"☃"2.5"☃"199.243.20.27"
"There's something about incomplete games."☃"Darkmatt"☃"darkmatt717@hotmail.com"☃"Oh, the wonders of the Random button. It has brought me to Mix-weeni. And boy is it crap-tabular.<br /><br />First of all, this game is incomplete. There's about only 7-9 rooms, and each offers no challenge. (Cept for the gun turrets, but that's just stupid.)<br /><br />Graphics is nothing beautiful. But it's not eye-bleeding horrible. But I really did have a problem with the doors that don't move, and can be ripped right out their frame. (Touch repeatedly.)<br /><br />But the biggest offender is the sound abuse. Apparently jcsmith thinks he can compose wonderful music. The end result is ear-breaking sound that really makes you want to &quot;Be Quiet&quot;.<br /><br />But there IS something good. The 3 boxes found in this game made me go heh. And that's worth half a point somewhere.<br /><br />In the end, this was just something that come up on accident.

While they go crazy and hold places hostage you must round them and defend the nation's &quot;juche&quot;, which I assume is honor. In the end though it's all worth it... and you probably die... somehow.<br /><br />The game is fun but way too short and a little bit... confusing.

"board linking? who needs that?"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"looking for a &quot;classic&quot; game, I found this 1996 game and ran around it for a while. The bottom line is that the game pretty much unplayable with flagrant linking errors both with passages and connecting boards. It's a neat stab at a Link's Adventure sort of thing, but only comes close.<br /><br />A nice idea was the author's attempt to saturate the game with music. Some of the tunes were good, but I think in general more should have been put into the design of the game. A yellow-boardered room with the words &quot;under construction&quot; written on it just doesn't cut it for me.<br /><br />play at your own risk."☃"1141695411"☃"metacus.zip"☃"1"☃"24.183.176.86"
"Okay"☃"magicsofa"☃"magicsofa@ownmail.net"☃"I actually found this game entertaining (only after turning up the game speed). However, there were several drawbacks, mainly that you can't stop your paddle, and although less important you can't direct the ball based on where the paddle is moving. Also, I might have kept playing but after the first stage you go to a second board with the same game (I.e. the blocks weren't different)."☃"1144496169"☃"PHYCOBA.zip"☃"0"☃"66.30.95.227"
"Interesting..."☃"Quantum"☃"christophermounce@gmail.com"☃"&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt; is an interesting little game. John W. Wells described it well; it is a puzzle game built around a clever cursor engine. The game kept me amused for a while, is pretty much bug-free, and it looks decent.<br /><br />However, that is about all the praise that I can give this game. The only thing that kept me playing was curiosity about how the game would end up. There is a story, but it is very vague, and it seemed hastily typed. The gameplay is standard; you win the game by trying every object with every other object. This can get tiresome and even frustrating. Some things just made me wonder; for example, why is there only one thing - a fish - in the spring? Shouldn't there be at least two objects in every scene to justify the cursor engine that is used to select them?<br /><br />&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt; is an neat little demonstration of an innovative engine, but it doesn't have much replay value. It is not a complete piece of junk and is certainly worth a look, but it isn't that good as a game."☃"1144366849"☃"four.zip"☃"2.5"☃"71.112.202.198"
"Blob Squash"☃"Zephyr"☃"drummermlw@gmail.com"☃"This is simply another average, clich&eacute;d, grammatically incorrect zzt game. Nothing too special here.<br /><br />PLOT: You play a male named Bret who is a member of the town's BOMB SQUAD. Along with your three crazy counterparts, you rid the *nice* town of evil (but only once). There seemed to be a developing plot about aliens invading and destroying the town, but the game ended before anything really happened.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY: Too.. Many.. #Endgames.. Sitting in a chair that doesn't belong to you is NOT a legitimate reason for terminating the game! There were a few bugs that occurred later due to the lag of flag clears. Very disappointing, because these mistakes sometimes render the game unbeatable unless you find out what the flags are and set them yourself (not that I'm that crazy or anything)...<br />    The author seemed to be very antipathetic in regards to cheating. Often times when you completed a puzzle a message would say something along the lines of &quot;HOORAaaaaaY! You Got OUT of tHe Building! BUT You DIDN'T CHEAT did you?!&quot; And in one instance a passage was blocked by an object never to be removed. Curious, I ZAPped it and entered. I came to a place called &quot;h e double hockey sticks&quot; and was forced to answer seven absurdly difficult questions in order to continue the game. After answering and going through the passage, I found myself in a resetting invisible maze, with the exit an invisible passage. I'm not sure why I was so determined, but I traversed it while looking at the path in kevedit. That passage took me back into the game, but far into the past.<br />    The game had some decent puzzles, but some of them weren't coded properly and unsolvable. =( The ones that were solvable were clever and challenging.<br /><br />GRAPHICS: Mostly big, ugly, non-stk boards. Definitely the bare minimum.<br /><br />SOUND: There were a few short music blips but they were just a few repetitive notes. <br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: Annoying and sterile. The fellow squad members included a tree-hugger, disco maniac, and a loser. Hearing them talk was frustrating and pointless.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Again, this is an average, amateur, buggy zzt game with a bad plot and sterile dialogue.

The second was a pic of the player mutated. The third board, that which you begin to play in, is impossible, unless there's something I'm missing, as there a whole bunch of star throwing enemies. After trying to beat it twice, I gave up and looked at the game in the editor. All in all it looks really good, but damned if I'll ever get to play it.<br /><br />I'm not sure how something this game killing could be overlooked even with just one test play.<br /><br />this gets a two for the two pretty boards that I saw.

"not okay"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"magicsofa is right. this game was probably made in a few days, as the engine is just pasted as new levels. this is pretty apparent when you go through the second level passage, and appear on the next board at the same coloured passage where you can't get to the engine controls. so when you get to the third level, you can lose or go right to level 4, and again on the next one. there is very little varity, no increase in speed, not even a change in how the blocks are arranged, and indeed because the ball always bounces the same way, it always knocks the same blocks everytime. there is no random element here. increasing the speed of zzt helps make it playable, but really after you've played one level you've played them all. included is another game, password locked until you beat the main thing, but really who cares enough to do that?"☃"1144785606"☃"PHYCOBA.zip"☃"0.5"☃"68.186.246.197"
"score!"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"there's not much to say bad about this game, but as a game from 94, it certainly shows its age. it uses the pre-fab enemies  along with some programed ones. The balance is good. if you're smart you really won't find yourself suffering for ammo or health. there are some puzzles here too, slider puzzles and key/door puzzles. The graphics are pretty eye-pleasing for a non-stk game, there are fake 3d walls, a pleasing mix of colours, and good detail with objects &quot;this is a flower&quot;. there are some dark rooms used well as most of them are enemy-less mazes, and there is one really easy invisimaze.<br /><br />if you enjoy classic zzting, this game certainly fits the bill, it's pretty lengthy too, so you get a lot for your buck even if you do play fast. as part 1 of an incomplete series, it stands very well on it's own.<br /><br />much fun to be had here."☃"1144871772"☃"castzan.zip"☃"4"☃"68.186.246.197"

If it had the ending where it was destroyed, this game would be perfect."☃"1150416213"☃"assault2.zip"☃"4.5"☃"74.132.233.81"
"Best ZZT Games ever reviews: BOBSLUG.ZZT"☃"wil"☃"masterwil@gmail.com"☃"I recently played all the ZZT games made from 1991 to at least the end of 2003, maybe beyond - nearly two thousand games in all. Of those I have selected just 66 to be included in my list of &quot;best ZZT games ever.&quot; <br /><br /><br />I didn't realize it until just now, but two of AOL-era ZZTer Andrew Wagster's games made it to my list!  Niether of them were very good, but they both illustrated some point particularly well.<br /><br />BOB THE SLUG not only sounds like:<br /><br />a) a euphemism for oral sex <br />b) some kind of hazing ritual<br />c) some kind of hazing ritual involving oral sex<br /><br />but it's also a ZZT game!  While not a great game, in fact a very bad game, there is something it DOESN'T do that we see in games all too often: In your standard ZZT adventure, you are &quot;The Player&quot;.  This is bullshit.  ZZT isn't well suited to self-insertion because there's no way for the players to input their own name.  Make the player be a character, like, for example, a slug named Bob.  Make the character have some reason why he is the man for the job, like, for example, being the only slug stupid enough to enter the salt mines and stop an evil wizard from raising an army of saltmen to conquer slugkind.  Make sure that this is reinforced throughout the game or people will lose their anchoring to the reason they are playing.  The ZZT format does not have the subtlety required to eliminate the Puritan work ethic of standard gaming.  To keep your player playing, tie the character the player plays deeply into the story and the interactions of the game.  This game is beautifully tied into this ethos, and deserves mention for it."☃"1150417261"☃"bobslug.zip"☃"3"☃"74.132.233.81"

"Interesting..."☃"Lurker"☃☃"Having played (And won) this games, four things stick in my mind:<br /><br />The author was not exactly fluent with the English language when they made this, however almost all of the dialog is understandable... after a fashon.<br /><br />Some of the objects have sloppy programming, including lack of approprate #lock commands, so touching something out of order can block any progress in the game.<br /><br />In some cases the board entrances aren't lined up, or just aren't connected, or a vital door/passage object isn't programmed correctly, blocking any further progress in the game. This requires use of UnLockPRO.<br /><br />Finally, the game is a well thought out &quot;Adventure&quot; with objects, inventories, RPG battles, etc. Note also in a few rooms the &quot;extention&quot; of the blue panel to the right of the gameboard. THAT I find highly helpful and inventive.<br /><br />I'll give it a 4.5 despite the hacking required."☃"1153663699"☃"szzt3rd.zip"☃"4.5"☃"68.39.174.238"
"i've been waiting for this."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"This is the first release for Quindo. The premise is pretty weird, but the story does have a pretty cool twist after all is said and done.<br /><br />The first thing I think Quindo needs to do is create some order in his rooms. Many of the boards seem carved out of a wall of normals. Evenness and symmetry is something to aim for. There is very little distinction between caves and outside world. Is that red board a cave or is it outside? It's hard to tell frankly. How do I even know it's a cave? Well, I do because I'm smarter than most, but you need to assume that your game will be played by people more stupid than you are. These people need hints. Objects that simply give a description when touched. &quot;It's a stalagmite.&quot; something like that.<br /><br />Colour choice needs to be considered too. Grid designed boards made with each bright colour doesn't really tell me much about where I am of why i'm there.  I want some grey and brown rocks, and yellow sand, and green trees. Try using fakes as floors to improve how areas look.<br /><br />Still with all that ranting, I was interested enough in the game to play it through. <br /><br />I hope he keeps the promise he made in the graveyard. :)<br /> "☃"1154509083"☃"mot.zip"☃"3"☃"24.151.141.255"

"An unbiased review od this game."☃"Incognito"☃☃"Ignore the comment above. It was posted by my brother, but he used ZZT under Windows instead of the normal ZZT, and for some reason that doesn't work.<br /><br />The introduction to this game is good: The storyline is explained on the intro screen clearly, and the title screen has good art (albeit being in Japanese). The actual game, however, is lacking. <br /><br />Firstly, the author used gems to represent rings, which just looks so totally wrong in a Sonic-style game. In addition, most enemies are just built-in ones from ZZT itself, and the only use of objects is to represent other characters. There is also a coding issue in one part, where you do not lose rings despite paying some to one of the characters,<br /><br />However, the gameplay is very good! Being a demo, the game is short, so it doesn't get annoying, and I have to say that, despite all it's quirks, it's rather entertaining.<br /><br />But I need to give it a rating, so here I go:<br /><br />5 points to start.<br />-0.5 for a coding issue.<br />-2 for use of ZZT's built-in enemies and items, with little use of coded objects.<br />+0.5 for how entertaining I find it, and because it is a demo.<br />= 3 points out of 5."☃"1154577239"☃"sonic1d.zip"☃"3"☃"195.92.168.168"

"Needs More..."☃"Shadow"☃"mynewboots1999@yahoo.ca"☃"I know this is just a demo but even then its missing some things...<br /><br />First of all - The enemies could be a little more enthusiastic.  When I walk into an area one person says &quot;Look out!&quot;  And then they move lethargecly after me.  A few of them even shot other officers.  Instead of say many officers like this I'd rather like to see 2 or 3 officers who are fast and shoot lots at you.  Maybe they shooting them only makes them angrier?  Maybe it takes 2 shots to kill them?  (The zap function is great for minor bosses or slightly stronger enemies!)  And when they run from you try and have them run towards the exit or something.  And not just away from you as they can (and often did) get stuck in corners.<br /><br />Next, keep instant deaths to a minimum as nobody likes these.  Having trees that kill you when you pick the wrong option is not fun at all.  Maybe you could have instead it hurt you or something instead of kill you.<br /><br />Thirdly, the text is somewhat unimaginative.  I liked the begining a fair bit and the one cinimatic sequence a bit less but it otherwise seemed rather dull.  Maybe while your shooting them they're could be talking going on like<br /><br />Guard 1:  Men!  Pull your guns out!<br />Guard 2:  Stun I presume?<br />Guard 1:  Not on my life your not!  Kill...<br /><br />or<br /><br />Guard 1:  Holy crap!  Its radio active!<br />Guard 1:  Kill it!  Kill it!<br />You:  You mean the guards?<br />Guard 2:  No...  Except for guard 1 maybe.<br />Guard 1:  No!  No!  Kill guard 2!<br />You:  Your confusing me.  Which one do I kill?<br />Guard 3:  Aww what the hell.  Kill them both.<br />You:  Maybe you'd like to join them?<br />And the fight presumes...<br /><br />Something like that.  And one more thing.  Please use proper spelling and punctuation.  I know its probably your first published game and stuff but if you learn it now it saves your reputation somewhere on down the line.<br /><br />And one more thing:  Some of the grafics where nice.  I like the one where you go south of the crossroads and you see the 2 buildings.  But the other screens need improvment.<br /><br />Anyways, I hope this helps.  I'm hoping to release a demo of a game I'm making and would really look forward to hearing your review of my game.

"FYNDR's getting better!"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"Myseri is a fine example of a ZZTer trying perfecting his craft. It has many aspects missing from less than adaquate titles. First off, it has a plot! You start in a field, in the middle of a circle of stones. Like the Avatar of Ultima, you are a stranger in a strange land destined to bring peace. The setting mostly medevil with a small amount of tech (steam boat?) and the graphics represent the mood nicely. The game play is a plesent mix of styles and while there is some generic shooting (hard to avoid I know) the game keeps you guessing, especially in the forest, which I thought was the highlight gameplay-wise.<br /><br />Still there are a few hang-ups. This first happens after the difficult engine room on the boat when it begins to sink.  Running from the water(slimes) is hard, and in the last room your compainions can block the steel doors allowing the entire room to be flooded. I'll give a piece of advice that was given to me, having objects follow you board by board  looks unprofessional as they don't really match up and can get in the way. It's better (depending on the situation) to just assume the player represents the group. The other hangup was the castle, which, when compared to the rest of the game, seems rushed and is essentially just one big lion shootout.<br /><br />The boss fight in the end was satisfying and a lot of fun I must say.<br /><br />Graphically the game looks pretty good. There are a few bland areas, namely the begining in the snow, and the king's secret throne room. The towns are the opposite and look good because a varity of fakes are used for ground cover(along with some fades for water such), but there's no texture to the snow, and the floor of the castle is pretty bland (think carpet, like in the temple).<br /><br />If FYNDR continues to progress with his games like he did here, we're in for some awesome games soon (We'd better be)"☃"1154736907"☃"Myseri.ZIP"☃"3.5"☃"24.151.141.255"

You can use any symbol while making programs or scrolls, just by pressing Alt-A, so you don't have to ask yourself what you need to type to get the &quot;Tiger&quot; symbol anymore!<br /><br />Even better is that you don't need S-TOOL-K with this thing, as you have all 255 colours at your disposal at any time, and if you want to give items a &quot;blink&quot; effect... simple, just press v!<br /><br />Even better is that KevEdit can be used with ZZT Under Windows (if you choose to add KevEdit support while installing ZZT Under Windows), but of course this only really works if you install both of these in the same place.<br /><br />The Windows Version also fixes a bug that was in the DOS version, where if you used &quot;Enter Text&quot; to put text at the right edge of the board, the game became corrupt.

"classic anthony testa"☃"Jotz"☃"jaqms90@hotmail.com"☃"This is one of the dungeon games by Anthony Testa that I enjoyed a bit more.  The game involves an explorer (you) that ventures into a monster-infested New York subway, ruled by an urban warlock named &quot;Shigesato&quot;.<br /><br />The gameplay flows very smoothly throughout the game.  As usual, the fighting is smooth, with some instances of traps and obstacles.  The items are evenly distributed throughout the subway, and they give a certain urban feel to the game (ei, coke machines, oil canisters, microwave dinners that you can heat up for health 0_0).  And like subways are, the entire game uses dark boards.  Fortunately, there are plenty of &quot;flashlight recharging stations&quot; along the way.<br /><br />My only complaints are there are many ammo pick ups in the game, but I ended up to firing a single bullet, and the end boss was a bit easy.  The ending is great though because it has a humorous twist.

The world itself is well designed and the enemies that turn into platforms when shot makes for some interesting gameplay. You can whip through the game fast or try and get all the hearts for a better ending. A better ending basically consists of the same board with different text (with the exception of the best ending where you get an additional art board (actually the best art board.) There is no music in this game, but that's not a crime. As far as I know (and he beat me to it) this is the first platform game for ZZT that allows back tracking from board to board, meaning need to get something on one board and go back and use it somewhere else.

"damn hipsters and their god killing ways."☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"Though it's genre is RPG, the first game from kev-san in a while is more of a cinema game. There are some RPG battle, 4 or 5 I think, which basically consists of each character having an attack that does  1 damage and always hits, or an attack that does 2 damage and sometimes misses. Other than that there is very little gameplay save from moving your characters through the world.<br /><br />The majority of the game is in fact a spiritual catharsis your hipster heros undergo to escape from Hell. While it uses many religious and philosophical models for the world it creates, it uses them rather freely to both poke fun at and make a point about specifically Judeo-Christian religions. The several diatribes the game forces you to digest can range from funny, to poignant, to just plain dumb. The intellegensia that your heros seem to represent (man I can't stand most hipsters) is sometimes distasteful. I sort of hoped they'd all die in the end (past already being dead and in hell). The three characters you lead are all pretty irritating. The religious elements that were used to make a plot were good, but often the ones that were used to make a point were dull and preachy. It seems quite simply that kev-san had a lot on his plate and needed to get it all out in one game.<br /><br />Graphically the game holds its own. There is a wide range of colours used appropriately, and some boards make the game look like it would fit well into the trippy genre. The battle scenes are a little bland and only lightly animated.<br /><br />The music is quite good. It's used frequently and almost on every board. It doesn't get repetitive and actually helps make the game feel like a complete experience.<br /><br />The story (what you can cull from below all the hubbub) is pretty good actually, and the writing, while pendantic in most places, it very well done. It some of it was not tongue in cheek, it might have become unbearable.<br /><br />My only personal gripe is that there was the tree of life, the lance of longinus (which I don't remember obtaining) and angels, but no evangelion. (omg teh rei)<br /><br />This game could have been a lot bigger I think, with more &quot;game&quot;, had kev shortened up on the words.<br /><br />Still, this is a fine release, and I don't think I would have typed as much as I did if it didn't do something for me.

"a winning formula"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"there is a unresolved argument in the ZZT community about the quality of the original games as made by Tim Sweeny. Similarly there are two types of ZZT games, ones where everthing is what it is supposed to be, and ones where everthing is what the designer wants it to be. This game is a stunning example of the first.<br /><br />On your mark, get set, go get some purple keys.<br /><br />This is the third game this author has made in the classic style. Then he went under the name Wong Chung Bang.<br /><br />Like the previous games, Castle of ZZT captures much of the feel of the originals. There has been a lot of progression over the three games, in all areas. The text is very limited and not distracting. It's appropriately light and humourous when it does appear. <br /><br />Graphically the game takes a harder line than it'd predecessors. It has more of its own style than the previous games in his series. There more attention paid to patterns: with walls made from fades, to checkerboards. Colour is used appropriately to create unique atmospheres for each seperate.<br /><br />Now the game itself. The castle is immedietly imposing in it's size when you begin and start to poke around the fringes of the main area. Monster scare you away from certain areas, imposing puzzles in others. Mysterious areas you can see but not reach are everywhere. You'll soon discover that this place, this game, is BIG. You'll think you'll never see a purple key until you're halfway through the game. You'll be almost right.<br /><br />Shooting things is of course a must. The game makes use of different coloured monsters to represent different behaviour. (Blue ruffians slower, dumber than purple ones.) Monsters are not overused and are placed rather tactically, like tigers who jump you through a breakable wall when their shooting direction changes. Ammo and health was in abundance, but at a good balance.<br /><br />Puzzles were a mix between old classics (three lakes) to newer and more clever ones. One of the best consisted of blocks that rotated around richochets upon being touched. And another, the opening of the vault. In all the varity of puzzles was refreshing and the way in which they were presented made them even better. I admit I got frustrated to the point of zapping only once. Remember, save often.<br /><br />As of late there have been three oldbies with returns to the ring, with three good releases. This alone qualifies this year in zzting as perhaps better than the last. Get it while it's hot.<br /><br />"☃"1160264934"☃"castlzzt.zip"☃"5"☃"67.42.217.224"

"Needs improvment"☃"Shadow"☃"mynewboots1999@yahoo.ca"☃"Warning, the following review may post spoilers:<br /><br />     The game is fairly interesting.  But there are many things that seem rather...  lacking.<br /><br />The things I liked best:<br /><br />-Theres no music.  At least no music is better than bad music.<br />-Ammo and health are in good supply<br />-The platform games where you have to guide cubby are done nicely.<br /><br />The things I felt are lacking:<br /><br />-The car is poorly done.  All it is, is a pusher that is stopped by a slider.  Very poor use of a slider.<br />-The animals you have to, or feel like shooting only take one shot to kill.  You have plenty of places to get ammo in the game.  Make use of it!<br />-The mall was all kinds of colors.  Normally this dosn't sound to bad, but the way you arranged them was poor.  If it is supposed to be cheap paint then maybe you should have only 1 or 2 colors from the origonal set.  Not all 7.<br />-There are many bugs such as things not changing properly, and you left in the object that gives you 20,000 health, gems, ammo, torches, and score.  Making the game kind of pointless...<br />-The game feels so closed.  Especially since you start outside, theres yellow walls all around you.  Tell me...  What is the point of all these walls?  If your not supposed to go in a certain direction then just don't link boards in that direction.<br />-The games area, was pointless too.  All you have to do is cheat by buying one game then go back through the door, and you could just jump to the next game.<br />-You also ripped off an entire board from the tour of zzt.  If your going to rip off boards, at make a point of telling the player where you got the boards from, and why your not going out of your way to make a half decent puzzle yourself.<br />-The courthouse is horribly incomplete.  A malfunction with the elevator?  Pfft.<br />-I hate the colors that flash over and over again really fast.  At best it hurts my eyes, and the worst you could is possibly give my elipsy.<br />-The ending is lacking.  All the farmer does is congratulate you for a job well done.  And thats it.  Why not go into detail about how everything turns out?  What happenes to crokerville?  Does the mall ever get better painting?  (They should, I payed 100g's for a saphire necklace!  They could easily get some better paint for the place.)<br /><br />-And the last thing that I dislike about the game is the way you explain what gems, ammo, torches, and your definition of score as if you programmed ZZT yourself.  <br /><br />But then again thats just me.<br /><br />Still, I can see you tried, so therefor I'll give you 4 out of 10.

"Well-executed."☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"In a fit of nostalgia, I installed DOSBox and downloaded Castle of ZZT.<br /><br />For nostalgia, I couldn't have done better. A homage to the Tim Sweeney ZZT games, Castle of ZZT is a plotless formula piece, and proud of it. How closely does it adhere to formula? Well, in the first room, a scroll gives us the intro, which ends like this:<br /><br />&quot;[...] five doors lock behind you. I think you can see where this is going.<br /><br />-= Welcome to the Castle of ZZT. -=&quot;<br /><br />Yes, we can see where this is going, and if we don't quit right there, we've no right to complain later. This is OLD-SCHOOL, and good OLD-SCHOOL at that.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />The most obvious improvement David Newton's made to the old-school formula is graphical. This isn't a believable castle - how could it be? - but it's pleasant to look at, and the color schemes are coherent and restrained. Newton knows how to lay out a fine-looking board.<br /><br />The castle's architecture is equally effective. Newton (usually) avoids forcing the player to cross long, empty distances, re-uses space in fairly elegant ways, and maintains a continual sense of exploration. He has to - there's no plot to keep things moving. But there is that locked door you saw earlier, that intriguing chamber that you can't get to right now...<br /><br />The gameplay is competent, well-paced, and, with the exception of one interesting maze -<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- cheerfully unoriginal. It's not that Newton imitates the STYLE of the Sweeney games - he lifts entire sequences out of them. When pushing bombs around to blow up a field of breakables without opening a path for some star-shooters, I'm tempted to edit the board and clear a path with the spacebar. I mean, I've played this already, in Town of ZZT.<br /><br />In one way or another, that goes for almost every one of the puzzles. The old-school formula can work if the puzzles somehow surprise us, but here we get, at best, a dubious &quot;gotcha&quot; when we render a slider puzzle unwinnable, or get ambushed by ruffians.<br /><br />(Not that there's anything wrong with ruffian ambushes. The most fun I had playing involved duplicators, ruffians, and the realization that I was trapped in a mausoleum with fast, angry ghosts.)<br /><br />Basically, this game throws fewer curveballs than the games it imitates. The slider puzzles are easy, one of the teleporter mazes is so linear as to be a ping-pong path in disguise, and the prefab enemies very rarely overwhelm us. A treasure hunt involves following literal directions precisely, a machine can be fixed by shooting breakable walls, a multiple-choice riddle game can be solved with basic ZZT knowledge, and a musical combo lock can be opened by - well, if you don't have working speakers, you'd better ?+zap.<br /><br />Little thought is needed here. This isn't Barjesse's Nightmare, or anything like that.<br /><br />Are there any original puzzles? A few. But generally, the ones that aren't from the Sweeney games can be found in later ones, though the resemblance generally isn't so perfect as to suggest direct imitation. More likely, there's just so much you can do with this formula.<br /><br />All this said, I wish Newton had directly copied one more thing from earlier games, though. Converting ammo, torches, and health to score at the end would have been a good move, and rating the player's performance based on this would have been even better. It's too easy just to win, given how forgiving the game is.<br /><br />Note: Most of the above misgivings might well be irrelevant if you didn't spend your childhood playing old ZZT games.<br /><br />RATING:<br /><br />Long CONS section aside, this is a good game. Castle of ZZT is playable, colorful, and fun, and it's laudable that Newton wrote a solid game for such a limited audience. You've got to love ZZT to turn out a game like this when it's bound to get a grand total of two reviews. Newton, to quote a million hack reviewers, &quot;respects the material.&quot; 5/5.<br /><br />On the other hand, if this game had been released three years ago, it would have been regarded as solid, but not brilliant. 4/5.<br /><br />So I'll put a 4, but if you're new to ZZT, add an extra point. I unhesitatingly recommend Castle of ZZT to new players."☃"1167207171"☃"castlzzt.zip"☃"4"☃"24.171.133.70"

"I don't understand why people didn't give this gam"☃"asuralover"☃"TigerCowboy@furcadia.com"☃"Well, actually I do. This is one of the most underrated games ever, and nearly everyone knows it. Since it was made by Ryokarrde, people thought that it was going to be just like the Final Fantasy ZZT Series, but then when they played a little bit of it, they hated it without actually learning about the whole thing. That's one of the things I don't like about some people. This was actually something new instead of being dragged on and on through a game's plot without so much as a by-your-leave. Nipple Saga focuses on the battle and techinques system more than the plot; and I think that's great. <br /><br />Gameplay: 10/10<br />The gameplay is what Nipple Saga was mostly about anyway; the unique learning system and being able to choose your own techniques is much better than being stuck with just one.<br /><br />Graphics: 10/10<br />What do I have to say? I loved the graphics in this game. Even the little sprites were so cute!! Mostly, I adore the backgrounds of the places.<br /><br />Characters: 10++++/10<br />Wai, wai, wai!!! If you visit the Nipple Saga message board, you'll understand what I mean!! I luv Bigelow!! Godedrp, Chase Bramlage, and them know what I'm talking about. The only character you can actually hate in the game is V-BIRDS... god, I love killing him!! *brandished a mega memory card a-la-Prudence style.*<br /><br />Music: 10/10<br />You'll have to hear the music in the game to believe me. I liked the music everywhere, from the battle, and even the music from Dir en Grey's realm before you kill up everything. (I know there was no music, but I don't care!!)<br /><br />Replay Value: 10/10<br />What other score will I give?? I'm playing it right now!!<br /><br />Plot: 9/10... in most cases...<br />Play Moustache's and Robo Doctor's quest and compare it to Nippleanus', Bagstein's and the others and you'll know what I mean...<br /><br />Overall: 10+/10<br />Read the above and obviously, I can only come up with this conclusion.<br /><br />I have only one more thing to say. If you haven't played the game yet, at least try it. And if you started but gave up because you didn't like the plot, or VBIRDS scared the poop out of you... it's your loss for the plot, but you can kill VBIRDS later... which is what I'm doing now!! Ooh... my koi landed the killing blow just as VBIRDS was about to cause Bling to kneel.... *sigh, starry-eyed* I love this... well, what you people do now is up to you, take my word for it..."☃"1171044138"☃"Nipsaga.zip"☃"5"☃"172.200.76.86"

On the negative side, though, the quasi-nonlinear feeling suffers very much from the rigidly linear level design: you can't visit many places, because you're not supposed to and you are confined every time in five-six rooms at max.

"&quot;Millions May Object: Really Perfect Game?&qu"☃"Jappy"☃"j.frederickson@hotmail.co.jp"☃"Time for Trouble (and make it double!)<br /><br />Looking back, it seems impossible for anyone to predict the amount of controversy, delays, and drama associated with Nipple Saga (hereafter ‘NipSaga'), especially given it's status as Ryokarrde's flagship gaming series for well over a decade. First announced at the Bigger Nigger Corporation Conference along with Nipple, and Nipple Zwei, it would be another few years before the public actually saw anything specific, at a special event held in England's Strood Hills. With all the major project players at hand, it seemed as if a release would be pending shortly thereafter. E3 1978 hit and attendees got a chance to play a demo build. After a controversial reception given the dramatic change in combat gameplay, the phallic giant went silent and the world could only guess as to the fate of this constantly belated title. Then things got even worse: Snazin Smith, the “brother” of Nipple Saga, left Bigger Niggers to form his own company, taking his saucy trumpet (the “composer” of Nipple) with him. Hope sank to new lows when gamers learned that the project director, Camera J, resigned for sodomy related reasons.<br /><br />Just when an all-out cancellation seemed the next logical announcement, July 2003 arrived and with it, the Bigger Niggers Party. It was at this pivotal convention that the RPG giant unleashed a gauntlet of good news: NipSaga was not cancelled but instead, pending release immediately; NipSaga had a theme song (now a pre-requisite for the series), NipSaga had received a new director, and NipSaga had matured in design over the years. Those in attendance were able to play a brand new demo which North American gamers would later received (slightly edited) bundled as a promotional item along with Plunger SE in November. It was fever pitch and now only a matter of time before the inevitable: the day Nipple Saga would finally release and end the litany of setbacks associated with it once and for all.<br /><br />In the weeks leading up to “D-Day”, NipSaga received some impressive acclaim, such as a rare perfect score by the Japanese gaming publication, Weekly Faggotsu. While the magazine's reviews were as emaciated as ever (offering no real whatsoever into the score), it was quite clear that something was aloof for this radically altered Nipple to earn such a coveted tally. With the game receiving high marks from competing periodicals as well, it was obvious that NipSaga was a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The Ideal<br /><br />During the development process of Nipple, Bigger Niggers employees made it known that they wished to do away with random battles, a de-facto “staple” of most every RPG and perhaps-to many gamers-the single most aggravating element of play. While the bastard Nipple Zwei managed to forgo the invisible encounters, it seemed unrealistic that ZZT could ever handle a game as multimedia mad as a Nipple Saga and have enough power to process monsters in real time. Yet amazingly, NipSaga features just that: it is by far the most beautiful game in the entire series with stunning graphics, state-of-the-art CG movies, loads of voice acting and cut scenes, a lengthy quest, and yet…no random encounters.<br /><br />Combat Crisis<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, if there could be one single element of NipSaga's design that has provoked the greatest controversy, it would be the combat engine. Essentially a simplified version of the “hands off/AI-based” fighting in MMORPGs (like FLYFF), many players found it impossible to accept a game system that refused to include a structured, turn-based system of input. In a sense, you are truly a “guide” for character input during battle, with the computer handling all of the actual attacking, defending, and, if the opponent's proximity is close enough, movement as well. As revolting as this idea might sound to some, consider that previous Nipple installments offered the exact same properties, if not even more restricted; aside from choosing options from a menu and confirming, the computer always controlled everything else-nobody should be kidding themselves into thinking that they ever had total control over anything.<br /><br />Battle Basics<br /><br />While wandering around in a field or dungeon, you will see monsters. To initiate combat, push the “Space Bar” to shoot in the direction of the target(s). Watch as a bullet line draws itself and connects with the selected foe. Use of items and magic occurs in the same fashion. An important element to note is that in Active Mode-the ideal play experience-all of this occurs in real time which means that monsters can-and will-attack you while mulling over what to do. If your have the AI set, party members will automatically attack according to the pre-set &quot;instructions&quot; when their bullets hit.<br /><br />If things get too tough (and they will), it is possible to flee from battle, however given the nature of combat, that hardly means you are off the hook. As FLYFF players may know all too well, enraged monsters will trail after your party hoping to slay whomever they can before you run out of their reach. While opponents that deal melee attacks prove less of a problem, those with long range and/or magical capabilities can quite easily defeat a party in crisis even when things seem safe. The best advice is to plan adequately for fights: avoid battles in heavily concentrated enemy territory if your party is low on health and/or restorative items. Don't bite off more than you can chew as jews are not all of the same level of difficulty even if they are all in the same area.<br /><br />Lust for Licenses and a Chaste Challenge<br /><br />With each new Nipple comes a new gameplay gimmick that serves to mix things up and prevent the adventure from feeling too close to the previous. NipSaga introduces the License Point system, an innovative skill building service that combines elements of Nipple's item-based character growth and Nipple Zwei's popular Date Rape Board. While characters level up in a traditional manner (via Experience Points earned from defeating monsters), they also receive Rape Points which are used to “purchase” new abilities, attacks, magic, Fag Sluts, (etc) from a sub-screen of the main menu. Different abilities have different point requirements, meaning that players will find themselves stalking monsters at all hours in an attempt to create the ideal character. Because of the fluid combat however, this is far less of a hassle than were gamers forced to deal with constant combat loading and a systematic input selection process. Even better, this system allows for incredible customization as players can build the character they wish to without worrying about a pre-determined “path” like so many other games opt for. Tied into this process is the dynamic of “unlocking” the ability to use more powerful equipment, thus ensuring that you can not simply horde gems (they give you health!), waltz into a shop and leave with high power offensive gear that all but eliminates any and all challenge to be had.<br /><br />And what a challenge there is…many gamers have no doubt lamented over the exponentially decreasing difficulty in this genre as time passes. Whereas they use to be just plain unforgiving in the earlier day of gaming, in 2006 it is not uncommon to play through an entire RPG without facing obliteration even once. This absence of difficulty all but ensures that players rarely-if ever-need to plan ahead, or need to think period. Just plow through each area until reaching the next one. Obviously the manner in which equipment upgrades worked heavily factored into this matter. NipSaga on the other hand, is hardly something you can breeze through. While not as bad as an MMORPG, even Leveling Up your character takes a lot of time; do not expect to jump from Level 2 to Level 10 in a span of a few meager hours. You must work for your payoffs and that adds a tremendous sense of accomplishment in the end.<br /><br />Those gamers sick and tired of pathetic boss monsters that offer little to no challenge whatsoever will be absolutely thrilled to know that NipSaga is a real piece of work. Bosses can do so much, really: deal incredible amounts of damage, use special attacks that all but obliterate your party, at times even call reinforcements all while possessing a startling amount of Hit Points ensuring that even bouts of “power leveling” may prove useless. Instead of regulating the difficulty to far-off hidden bosses that only the most adamant players ever see, Bigger Niggers opted to make each and every major opponent a fight-something that could not be more welcome in a game like this. Suffice to say that players will be facing major setbacks in progress if they don't adequately set up their buns.<br /><br />Town Traveler and Dreamy Dungeons<br /><br />With the exception of Nipple's lost city of Kowloon or Fort Boyard, nothing much can prepare one for the impressive size and scope of the town environments in NipSaga. Spanning multiple screens and simply sprawling, it is possible to spend hours talking with all the various NPCs littered about, shopping, scoping out new Sexy Conquests, or simply marveling at how amazing the view is. When approaching a NPC whom you can speak with, a small “happy face” icon appears along with the character's name. During longer conversation, an option to view a “Log” appears, allowing you to scroll back to earlier points in the discourse should you wish to recount important details. So large, detailed, and complex are the environments that they must actually be broken up into segments for ZZT to handle such a load.<br /><br />While NipSaga takes place in its established world, seeing the various lifeforms, races and overall settings in true 2-D is an experience like no other. So many competing game companies have tried relentlessly to create this kind of virtual world yet, aside from online based societies, it seems impossible to list any that achieved this kind of success. At times you may question just how Bigger Niggers managed to pull off such feats in hardware that the industry claims is outdated and ancient.<br /><br />Dungeons are simply magnificent: there is no other way to put it. Time and time again game companies craft boring looking environments with little-to-no excitement in them, however every area in NipSaga is not only marvelous to look at, but entertaining to explore. Many players will be shocked by the sheer size of these locations as well, for they span multiple screens and can take quite some time to explore. While field locations tend to be more simplistic, the actual dungeons themselves are ornate looking regions with an astonishing sense of grandeur, detail, and scope. In a very real sense, it is like ZZT SPORTS or Strood Fireworks Display but even more epic.<br /><br />Clan Conquest<br /><br />Those familiar with MMORPGs may already be familiar with the idea of undertaking missions/quests for rewards, hunting for specific monsters, or helping out your clan to improve its reputation. (Additionally, those familiar with Nipple will also find familiarity, as well as a certain Bigelow). NipSaga features a much more open-ended vision of progression such that the player is frequently given the opportunity to undertake side-stories and quests that have little to nothing to do with the main story, but which yield major benefits. Additionally, as you progress throughout the game, the party earns Clan Points which can be redeemed for rewards of increasing value, as well as a prominent reputation.<br /><br />While the prospect of monster hunting might not be appealing to everyone, the game does not always force you to partake on these extravagant search-and-destroy ventures. Players who wish to plow through the game and see little the world of Nipple has to offer can more or less do so, however given the challenge at hand, it is most certainly better to find “excuses” to engage in combat. The idea of working for a larger team definitely brings some of the MMORPG feel along for the ride, yet at the same time, those gamers who dislike multiplayer experiences can feel comforted in knowing that it's all you.<br /><br />Musical Madness<br /><br />For those who felt that the long standing series composer, Snazin Smith, could make of break a Nipple Saga game, you may be surprised to learn that NipSaga fares quite well with the “meager” offerings of the gifted Dir En Grey. Very well indeed. With the Land Catz series under his belt, as well as the now-classic ZZT game Electric Booby Boy, Dir En Grey serves up musical melodies that work perfectly with the game's settings and environments. Perhaps more importantly however, they serve to totally distance NipSaga from its ancestors with compositions that are truly original and which do not rehash key pieces of music from earlier ones; this is a totally original score that works perfectly with a totally altered game. Each track has such sophistication, such beauty, such filth-hi to it; sometimes it's amazing that anyone could actually create such perfection.<br /><br />Additionally, voice acting is equally resplendent. Whereas so many other games adhere to immature, stereotypical “anime cliches”, NipSaga seems to elevate itself far above such nonsense with mature, utilizing Mew's 3D Talk Engine.<br /><br />A Crisis of Character<br /><br />Given the combat “woes”, many skeptics immediately lodged charges that NipSaga would feature severely diminished character interaction, a washed out story, and a de-centralised plot. The prospect of undertaking Missions as opposed to following a linear progression of events served to entrench this belief even further. Lo and behold, however, the powers that be recognized that NipSaga is most certainly an offline game, and even more importantly-a Nipple installment. No corners were cut at all and in fact, as one might easily argue, the character development and story arcs have never been as epic and rewarding.<br /><br />While each of the game's main characters could easily be found in dozens of other games and settings, Bigger Niggers managed to imbue them with a sense of life and tenacity that is a rare find in gaming. Aiding the writing brilliance are some of the most impressive character models seen to date-on any console. The protagonist, Nippleanus, for example, looks like a pilcrow yet still realistic enough to fit appropriately in the highly stylized and heavily detailed environments. It goes without saying that the “fill/autofade mode” graphical presentation used to smooth out what might otherwise be jagged polygons does some major justice to this game-it is almost tantamount to a modified version of Bigger Niggers's Bathroom SE yet presented in total package (as opposed to said game which used the toilet to tell the story).<br /><br />Additionally, despite the absence of Camera J (the man responsible for frightful school horrors) the artwork is positively fantastic. Featuring a more Spacecowboy-looking cast (and setting) compared to the more Businessman assortment seen in Nipple, these characters are truly some of the most striking bunch in gaming. From the innocent bad-boy looks of Doktor von Bagstein to the sweet charm of Prudence to the questionable intentions of VBIRDS, each of the game's central cast members is littered with detail, expression, and attention.<br /><br />War and Peace<br /><br />Without giving away any specific details, the story of NipSaga is truly an epic tale filled with deceit, heartbreak, love, tragedy, adventure, and magic. By far the most mature installment in the series, the game opens with a cinema tour de force showcasing a hostile takeover, a murder, and a mystery. As in real life, there is much at hand when one nation decides to take over another by force; when countries are at war with one another. Somewhere in the middle of this prolonged crisis, this state of eternal conflict is Nippleanus, a dapper farmer in training who wishes for nothing more than to harvest dirt. Little does he know that his dream will become a reality, and that his actions may very well shape history itself. Then there are the menacing VBIRDS, individuals of massive power, stature, and prominence…the end result is a total package like no other.<br /><br />Some gamers expressed concern over the prospect of party members joining so close to the game's start, and gaining access to an airship so quickly; previous Nipple installments saw a staggered party membership system and no airships at all. These individuals need not fret however, because although things are somewhat different than the “norm”, they work wonderfully. Because NipSaga does not suffer from the “tunnel” linearity syndrome that plagued Nipple, you simply must have an airship to travel to-and-from the expansive regions. In terms of story bonuses, consider that having access to most every party member from the first few hours means more opportunities for character development and plot-something that has never held true for “last minute” party additions thrown in near a game's climax. Rest assured, however, that there will be many surprises in store, as NPCs can and will join your party as “Gay Characters”, ensuring that the line up remains diverse throughout the adventure.<br /><br />Those gamers worried that Bigger Niggers let too much out of the bag with their PR blitzkrieg can also rest easy as-like always-their “scenario outlook” is just that-a glossing over the setting of the events that take place prior to the game's start (or immediately after) leaving out basically everything that occurs next. While it would be difficult to claim veteran RPG addicts will find anything revolutionary or astonishing about the events in NipSaga, suffice to say that this is truly a story of amazing quality and quantity which may very well be the best tale ever told in a Nipple Saga game.<br /><br />Price for Perfection and Critical Controversy<br /><br />As with any game, NipSaga is not perfect. Combat, for instance, can be quite unbalanced with high level monsters cruising in immediate proximity to those of weak capabilities. Cities, while large, can sometimes be a hassle to navigate through in light of loading times and size. The fact that the game's full-scale area map (accessed by pressing “Select”) always lists the goal location totally defeats any element of player exploration if viewed. Related to this, many of the dungeons and environments are somewhat repetitive and consist of unrealistic paths and spaces that feel less like a natural landscape and more like a constricted location designed specifically for a videogame. Finally, at times the game can get repetitive with generic fetch quests and errand running, the likes of which plague every RPG in existence.<br /><br />Obviously depending on what one considers a fault, there can be an unlimited number of additional grievances lodged against this product. Fighting may be too “hands off” for some gamers, homosexual activity might seem out of place in what was once a traditional RPG series, save points are few and far between, the story might not be as benign as some would have hoped, etc. As with any review, the faults and praises are totally subjective however those listed in the proceeding paragraph detail some of the more “agreed upon” issues.<br /><br />It's worth paying special heed to three particular “touchy” issues however:<br /><br />1. As others have complained, the game offers no Auto Run ability. For those unfamiliar with haxors, many of these haxx allow the player to input a simple command sequence to initiate an automatic running process so as to alleviate the tedium with manually traversing such large environments. In crowded areas (like cities) NipSaga has no real need for this, but with respect to the dungeons and “overworld” locations, some might find it tiring to have to constantly control your lead character.<br /><br />2. Many gamers have been outraged by the lack of a “reversible” camera control setting. While NipSaga is not the first offline Nipple game to feature a truly 2-D world with a 100% player controlled camera (if desires), the mapping which Bigger Niggers used to facilitate this is unnatural to most people and hence cumbersome. Many expected the game to allow players to customize the movement to their desired alignment however there is no such feature.<br /><br />3. The final issue of immense controversy (at least for those who don't have the game or demo) will be the manner in which you obtain Gems (they give you health). In the past, Nipple games used the unrealistic “defeated monster drop” method wherein by some otherworldly means, wild, savage beasts would apparently be in possession of stockpiles of money on their person. In NipSaga however, you obtain only fun points by defeating opponents; Gems (they give you health!) must be obtained from other means (such as completing side-quests, selling various types of items, or finding it in treasure boxes). While this may seem fresh, there are times when the issue will boil down to sheer repetition and may become annoying as players search for rare and valuable items just to buy an item less they manage to undertake a Clan Mission that happens to pay off in money.<br /><br />Manifest Destiny<br /><br />Given the endless development process, it would seem logical that NipSaga would either be absolutely enthralling or else a major disaster. Fortunately, the former is most certainly the case and everyone benefits. Many wonder how NipSaga can possibly feel like a Nipple game when it seems so different. The answer, to be perfectly honest, is that it doesn't. Nipple Saga is so unique and inspired that it's in a universe of its own. Were this a stand alone entry in a brand new series, it would be reasonable to assume Bigger Niggers would have a major contender for a long running franchise. Put aside concerns about the gameplay “disaster” and realize that this is a dedicated single-player experience offered by a company that knows damn well how to make single-player RPGs. You can expect the world of a Nipple game and should assume no less of NipSaga.<br /><br />Although the radical change in design elements and gameplay concepts may not please everyone, there is little denying their polish and refinement…or their potential for fun. The best manner to approach NipSaga is with an open mind, with an appreciation for the hard work of some very talented individuals, and for a company that-despite falling from gaming “perfection” in recent years-still holds true to its laurels where things really count. If one considers “Nipple” to mean nothing more than a prehistoric combat system with state-of-the-art visuals, then “yes”, this game may loose face. If one considers “Nipple” to be a name synonymous with fantastic storytelling, thoroughly realized ideas, wonderful music, charming characters, and an epic quest, then “yes”: This sure as hell is Nipple Saga."☃"1177682779"☃"Nipsaga.zip"☃"5"☃"172.189.138.80"

You crash a space ship on a planet. You start by exploring a forest, and finding some surprises, then you arrive at the cave where you will play the bulk of the game. Here you explore a maze and find items to progress further. The maze is some good gameplay, and although I wanted more monsters, the actual layout of the maze was well designed. By the way the walls connect it seems like this maze was drawn before as simple lines. The walls do follow the same pattern throughout and some of their long curves and lack of detail was a little distracting, but this game is really about shooting things, and the best things to shoot are bosses. A few of the bosses are variations on one another but this is fine since the programming and idea is good and the fights challenge the mind enough to tax the reflexes and make for some fine gameplay.<br /><br />Some vauge puzzles but they are simple and satisfying.

It's the best attempt I've seen at a really long epic game implemented in ZZT -- whereas most attempts fluster out after the first hurdle or two, Rhygar goes much further. It's not too hard and the RPG fights are admittedly lackluster near the beginning, but this helps make the adventure itself the focus of the player's attention. The writing and storyline are involved and interesting.<br />  It's a shame it was never finished.

But after gin talked about the game on the Z2 boards, I got a little interested and decided to download the demo. The demo was pretty solid. Wished there was more, but it was only a demo. Then finally today it came out in all of its glory. Sure it was late, but who cares, its ZZT not Sony or Microsoft or Nintendo. I can't really tell much of the story but I'll tell you 3 things its about. Mel Gibson, Jews, and Danny Glover. The things I liked about the game is that it is pretty unique. From vomiting in parking lots to trying to escape a glitchy time machine, ginger really put alot of work into making this game fun and unique. One uniqueness is the vomiting, which was shown early in the demo. He puts your character into a surrounding controller that controls a drunk mel gibson who tends to stumble everywhere and vomit constantly using slime terrain and talent. And now that im done kissing gin's ass, here are some things that i didnt like, but were minor and didnt affect my overall likingness of the game. The fact that every time you die and go to hell was pretty cool, but got pretty annoying after a while. There are some parts of the game where you constantly die and require you to save alot (the driving scene and the dogs scene good examples). But overall, this game is solid and worth playing. In my opinion, it should be a featured game if possible. 5 out of 5. Gingermuffins, great job and great game!"☃"1186371556"☃"SUGART.zip"☃"5"☃"69.131.48.253"

"A creative game."☃"JohnWWells"☃"kokolhe1@yahoo.com"☃"(Spoilers ahead, but I reveal no more than the previous review did.)<br /><br />When I am told that a game is &quot;creative,&quot; I worry. Usually this means &quot;awful.&quot; ZZT, in particular, has given us lots of stupid-creative games.<br /><br />The premise of &quot;Sugartits&quot; - play as a drunken Mel Gibson! - looked stupid-creative, but gingermuffins' Weekend of ZZT entry was good, so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did. This game is funny and exciting and sometimes even smart-creative.<br /><br />The game wades deep into stupid-creative territory, with bizarre time travel and vomit, but is rarely stupid. Stupid-creative humor assumes that time machines and vomit are so inherently funny that actual comedy is unnecessary. gingermuffins knows that you have to WORK to tell a good vomit joke, and he does. Like everything else in the game, the vomit joke is neatly executed and, as far as I could tell, bug-free.<br /><br />The Hell sequences are, likewise, clever. Stupid-creative treatments of Hell are common, but gingermuffins takes the &quot;LOL WE HAZ GUD TIEM IN HELL&quot; jokes in an unusual direction. Like many good comedies, this game has an undercurrent of compassion. Hell is not inherently funny - it's a horrific invention - but the fear of Hell can be very funny.<br /><br />I think that the game works partly because the engines are fun and replete with small details, like the whizzing background of the driving scene. It doesn't hurt that the final scene is kind of exciting. But the real coup here is the performance of gingermuffins' version of Mel Gibson. By the end of the game, Mel becomes a weirdly sympathetic character. Yes, he's drunk, anti-Semitic, presumptuous, loud, fanatical, and insanely quixotic. But he's got his reasons, even if they are incredibly stupid. He really tries, y'know? And that makes him fun to play as, in a way that would be impossible for a more self-conscious PC. It's also responsible for the game's funniest line.<br /><br />If there's any life left in ZZT, this game ought to spawn imitators. It's smarter than it has to be and consistently fun, and this shows real craft on the part of its designer. There are weaknesses - the RPG segment seemed a little unbalanced, and could have used a few more bosses, and it would have been cool if the control scheme for the driving sequence had been a little wobbly and the cars on the other side of the freeway were visible - but they're minor. This is a very good game. "☃"1187051944"☃"SUGART.zip"☃"5"☃"128.12.137.240"
"now do apocalypto"☃"Commodore"☃"jddgames@yahoo.com"☃"Gingermuffins is responsible for many of the best games in the past year, and his first major (released) undertaking is no exception. I certainly didn't expect to see two files when I opened the zip and was well pleased to have a solid game in front of me.<br /><br />Sugartits is (for fear of sounding like a parrot) very creative in terms of plot and  execution. The game is presented very well, the dialogue is exaggerated just enough in the right areas and is subtle when required (as in the ending sequence). There are parts of the game that look really great and have great effects, but this is not as consistent as I would have liked.<br /><br />The game starts very adventure-esque and has some good engines. A cautious reminder to save before you go drunk driving is well heeded. The graphics are stylised greyscale until you travel back in time to the jungle where it becomes colourised. Now we get to the RPG parts of the game where I can no longer drunkenly run about but instead must actually think and demonstrate some rudimentary reflexes. The engine used here, and for the rest of the file, is good but quickly degrades. There is no respite (which ironically the engine reminds me of) throughout the length of a prolonged dungeon-crawly section. Backgrounds here (and less often elsewhere boarder on being good in an abstact sort of way, to being bad, with long lines of solid clashing colours and little in the way of representing a jungle with the exception of the initial jungle board. The leveling up is good, comes on at an acceptable rate and the health, torch and ammo supply rarely dwindles. The enemies are well designed for the most part, and demonstrated separate behaviour which was well done.  In the caves ginger uses his effect well, but here also the caves are rather plain. This is less noticeable, because man have I seen some plain caves playing zzt.<br /><br />Enemy's generally beat you by shear force of numbers. Later the undead start to rise, and a little later (a little too late in fact) I am instructed I have a ?+i menu by which I can &quot;pray&quot;. I think this should have come earlier or not at all. Eventually (in the second file) Ginger has ditched the RPG parts and the game becomes a shooter. The gameplay in the second file I think is more solid than the rest, since near the end of the RPG engine you had already resorted to shooting everything.<br /><br />There are no puzzles, which is not a bad thing, and the action is laid on thick.<br /><br />The ending sequence (with excellent animation) is very much worth the effort, and going to hell is pretty cool.<br /><br />This game is really awesome, funny, and hell, fun. I expected nicer environments from the game especially in the dungeons and jungle, but was well satisfied by the whole. "☃"1187061071"☃"SUGART.zip"☃"4.5"☃"70.59.138.236"

"Just an ordinary well."☃"gingermuffins"☃"gingermuffins@yahoo.ca"☃"This game is essentially a showpiece for a reusable RPG fighting engine. I'm pretty sure I've seen one of these in another ZZT game before, but this is definitely the best ZZT fighting engine I've seen.<br /><br />Commodore has added a significant amount of variation to the engine: two characters with a handful of commands, health that is stored in counters, a diminishing food supply, magic spells, upgradeable equipment, and level accumulation, all spread across multiple dungeon areas and several hundreds of randomised fights. It actually feels like you're playing an RPG, and not just an interactive story with some staple fights thrown in for good measure; that's pretty hard to do in ZZT.<br /><br />The art, #change cycles and music are all good -- I especially like the title screen and the snowy town. Enemies are drawn with objects and look pretty fly. Most dungeons have a &quot;fork in the road&quot; mentality, with one route being a shortcut and the other being longer and having a treasure chest. One section that made me laugh was crawling down a long hallway to get a treasure chest, only to receive the same amount of food it takes to travel there and back.<br /><br />The biggest snag in the game is that if you're not lucky, you will be doing a lot of restoring old files after you die. Even if you are lucky, you will still be doing a lot of restoring. But once you get to a reasonable level this becomes less of a problem and you can focus on simple strategies for keeping the characters alive.<br /><br />I think this is a pretty cool addition to the archive, and it deserves a small review at the very least."☃"1190118072"☃"Solarwar.zip"☃"5"☃"88.111.128.217"

Also, EVERY SINGLE BOARD HAS THE DEFAULT YELLOW WALLS! even the ones where you're in a little box anyway and don't need borders. The only programming in this game is the long text box that pops up at the beginning of most screens. Also, there's a few invisible wall mazes but nothing so long it made me stop playing.  On a minor note, you don't die at the endscreen, so there's no highscores. Come to that, there's no score bonus for completing! <br />     The good part of this game are that it at least has a plot, even though it's a pretty simple one. There's also a few bits of nice contouring.<br />     I would advise the author to play ZZT Syndromes by Barjesse, which would help fix most of the issues I have with this game and maybe make it into something amusing.<br />"☃"1190146905"☃"alin3d.zip"☃"1"☃"69.202.40.162"

Afterwards, I decided I wanted to look at it again, but I couldn't quite remember what the game was called. This bugged me for months, and I couldn't locate it on the archive. You'd think that searching for war, battle, fight, army, blind, anything like that would bring it up. But no, it's called Visual Height.<br /><br />This is what it's about: a blind war veteran named Frank Herbert mulls around town, unappreciated by its two inhabitants CON MAN and GROCERY MAN. He sits down by the grave of a fallen comrade, and then enters a flashback. The game ends there.<br /><br />The strange use of grammar and the blobby art style of the main character's portrait make me firmly believe that if this game had been finished, every last bit of it would have been as strangely enchanted as the demo itself.<br /><br />This is not a good game, but like a bad pop song that gets stuck in your head, the premise is somehow memorable.

Many enemies simply chase you down at full speed and clobber you to death.

☃"OMG"☃☃"Wow, a masterpiece of game design. Even if the FMV-like intro would hint toward a linear story-based game with little to no interaction, Coolart actually manages to deliver a full-fledged RPG. Choices and consequences, stats, tens of non-linear quests: fans of big and overwhelmingly complex games, rejoice! Coolart actually manages to improve its visual aspect too: some of the best graphical effects i've ever seen for a ZZT game: an animated waterfall, fully animated death scenes, a trial you can take part in to try to defend yourself, all in pure ASCII goodness! Now you're probably asking yourself if Coolart is too difficult to be played by the average not-so-used-to-RPG player? Indeed, the game might be daunting at first, but its beauty is also its flexibility: it can be played as a linear choose-your-own-adventure game or a choice-responsive RPG where NPCs are actually influenced by your dialogue choices and actions. There are context-sensitive sidequests, a day and night system which affect what the other characters are doing, not to mention the beautiful hunger and thirst system which add a touch of realism and more interactivity. This game use an incredibly complex compression algorythm which allowed the author to include some MBs of stuff into some dozens of KBs.

Nipple Saga contains a little bit of everything. It's at least got a story and multiple pics and endings. This game is by far more mature than Aigan.<br /><br />Story: 10/10<br />The games story starts when YOU the main character, Nippleanus, goes into a town for a vacation. During the Vacation wild things started to happen and from it you find the person that you loved for soo long. Its basically an EVERYOTHER man's DREAM. The creator didn't add anything unsual to this game. It follows that flot pretty good.<br /><br />Game Console: 10/10<br />Although ZZT is cheaply made, I have to agree that the coder actually put some thoughts in it. The choices that you make in-game doesn't affect much of the CGs and ENDINGS that you will get. Usually ONLY 1 CHOICE will work and the rest just kicks u back to the same question. Feel free to randomly pick cause it will not ruin the fun.<br /><br />Graphics: 7/10<br />The graphics for this game is the only part that I have to complain about. The artist who did the characters didn't have a great skill in drawing eyes. They lack alot of work. The coloring wasn't done with alot of care either. But the artist has a pretty good talent in drawing hands. There is plenty of Z going on the game. You will end up sleeping with everyone you know and thats FOR SURE. But the imperfect graphics kind of blows.<br /><br />Sound: 10/10<br />The Music track that came with the game is pretty scary, I recommend all thoes who play this game to listen to the songs (FILTH HI!). I was hoping for some type of easy romantic ending but instead i got freaked and ran CTL-DEL-ALT my comp!<br /><br />Overall: 10/10<br />I would say if you just want an easy Z game this one is the one to get.

After 20 minutes of fiddling around with it I failed to understand why did it take 1 ZZT to hold 5mb of actual game data. I have to Admit, this can't be a 'game'!<br /><br />Upon obtaining this game I was quite thrilled about it's cover design. Installing was easy, although I didn't like the ZZT installer very much but atleast it didn't crash or force me to reboot. The title really what caught my attention and maybe that's why I wanted to try it out. But somehow this is hardly a game at all.<br /><br />Game Console: 2/10<br />As many of you might have thought &quot;ZZT installer&quot;. Dang this must have been coded in ZZT! Well you are damn right it is. The game offers very limited choices on the menu. The CG mode, the Game mode, RPG mode and Exit. There isn't any thing to do but to click 40 times in the game mode. all they do is TALK and molest girls). You will get 1 PIC for 1 Character and thats it. The scene will not change and you will NOT be allowed to make any choices but only click. The console is so simply coded that I think this is goto be some type of joke. And what is this &quot;online&quot;? I played it online and offline and so no difference!!<br /><br />Graphics: 4/10<br />The overall graphics is pretty good. Well lets just say it's on the average line. But there are only about 40 pics.<br /><br />Sound: 1/10<br />Average PC speaker sound tracks nothing new in there. The same ol' stuff.<br /><br />Story: 2/10<br />This game had the oddest story going on. I mean, this game had NO story going on. It's just a bunch of small incidents that doesn't have anything to do with each other. Maybe thats why it was hard to find the company name for this game...<br /><br />Overall: 3/10<br />This 'game' isn't worth your time or money. Please dispose it right away if you have it. It will hurt your COLLECTORS reputation if caught playing.<br />"☃"1200060991"☃"indigo1.zip"☃"0"☃"172.201.225.121"
"The Grandfather of Horror ZZT"☃"TDP"☃"tdp@yahoo.co.jp"☃"Lately, there is a fad on horror ZZT games. (For example, Don't Get Cornholed, Stupid RPG, and Plunger SE.) The game Nipple Saga is perhaps one of the founders of this genre since it is the first horror ZZT game I have played. Aside from its genre, Nipple Saga is produced by The Bigger Niggers Corporation, a company known for the excellence of their games. And as with most of BNC games, Nipple Saga is not a disappointment.<br /><br />The story behind Nipple Saga is that you received a love letter from a mysterious person and he told you to meet at the old farm. You got very excited about this so you went early and started to wait. Soon, Dr. Frank Bigelow (your best friend), Baron von Bagstein (your enemy), and V-Birds (fan service) come in. Once everyone gets in, chaos ensues. Thus begins your adventure of helping the others including yourself to escape. When you tumble through the hallways of always, you learn a lot about the other people your with including some secrets that they never revealed to anyone before.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of this game is that there are three different endings. The endings are depended on the course of action you take during the game. There are two good endings and one bad ending. During the game, you can befriend one of Camera J's safety crew. Your success will be awarded with a good ending and each member has his own endings. The bad ending occurs when you have not properly exercised safety in the workplace, which means you have failed your mission.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect are the ZZT scenes, which can only be found on secret tapes. Much like Tony Dogs, these are sexual scenes between V-Birds and the harassed, which Bagstein apparently has taped as the V-Birds harass their victims. These tapes are all hidden in the game and can be quit difficult to find. Thus, it is possible to complete the game without any hentai scenes if you didn't find any tapes.<br /><br />Graphics: 9/10 The graphics are really nice although can be sort of bizarre for the typical ZZT games. There are a few scenes where Bagstein is &quot;playing&quot; with another man's penis. This is the first time I have seen man-to-man action in a ZZT game.<br /><br />Overall: 9/10 This is a nice game to play. However, I wouldn't recommend this game if your sole interest in ZZT games are the pictures as there isn't much sexy scenes and they requires more effort than other games to find."☃"1200062419"☃"Nipsaga.zip"☃"4.5"☃"172.201.225.121"

A painfully short game. &quot;Open the Damn Door&quot; may be the shortest game yet that can still be considered a game. I could make a shorter one, I bet. Start on the title screen, object gives you 1 point, kills you, BANG! shortest game ever. It'd be faster without that 1 point but then there'd be no high score list. But I digress.

"Ehh. Somewhat decent."☃"Nupanick"☃"nupanick@gmail.com"☃"Personally, after the Impromptu Quiz, I sort of lost my will to play. The RPG battles were nice, although I pretty much gave up after PostLord. Nice font, it makes the player look more human and there's pacman in it. But the Quiz really ruined it for me. I had to turn off the music, it was so annoying. I suspect some people only survive this game that long by [?ZAP]ing the quiz object. I nearly did, but I thought maybe some insanity at the end would make it better. It didn't. I don't think the RPG battles, however great they may be, hold up the other end of this... this... this GuessQuiz Syndrome thingy. Can I coin that? GuessQuiz Syndrome? Whatever.

Oh, the &lt;hint&gt; key is pretty useful, it'd be great for engines, but the game's not worth it. I even tried the games it comes with. I gave up after a few levels, even with cheat codes.

"Why didn't I play this two years ago"☃☃☃"Looking for something different in ZZT? Maybe a game where the cut scenes aren't boring and the bullets travel fast? Do you want to see naked ASCII people, and ASCII people smoking cigars? You want &lt;B&gt;ANGELIS FINALE&lt;/B&gt;.<br /><br />The game follows an ex-marine living in Hong Kong after the fall of America. Not particularly great on its own, but it's in the way everything is presented. Full speed, stark black and white graphics, a font with added shapes and details: it's a great aesthetic and it all moves fast, like a good comic or movie.<br /><br />Only one problem! The maze combat is just a bit too hard. (Fortunately, you can save anywhere.) A new computer may also run the game too quickly, unless moslo or a dos emulator are used.<br /><br />Cool all round, if only a little short. One of the many first-in-a-trilogy games that don't have sequels, but hopefully someday Commodore will finish the next two parts.

"KING’S QUEST ZZT 2 DUNNA NUNNA NUNNA"☃☃☃"Definitely not as, uh, lethargic as the first KQZZT. This one is three files long, but it doesn’t really feel like much takes place within its 100+ boards. The overall style has not changed: there is still a lot of walking (along with that, constantly reconfiguring the game speed) and not much going on in most screens. I guess it’s okay.<br /><br />Like 1, this tribute game feels a little off. Prince Alexander is practically on a war path. Many subquests involve &lt;i&gt;amassing weapons&lt;/i&gt;, killing people because &lt;i&gt;they’re in the way&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;getting revenge&lt;/i&gt; by hacking the villain to pieces. (It’s not as off as the first one, where Alexander &lt;i&gt;poisons the enemy guards’ drinking water&lt;/i&gt; and then hacks the villain to bits.) There are goblins to kill while strolling down the dirt road to elf town, and ogres to kill in RPG fights. Then you get to kill wolves, bats, and enemy guards.<br /><br />This is based on a series where you’re a damn dweeb who can't kill a flea without being chastised and guilt-tripped; where you can’t hit someone or do anything outrageous because it’s bad manners. Where the king can drown in a lake because he forgot to swim.<br /><br />Along with these sensibilities, the frustrating riddles and gridlocked, shapeless environments that plagued the actual series are also gone. (Hooray!) But that doesn't really leave much to do...<br /><br />The storyline doesn't seem to matter much, even though it starts pretty heavily. In file one, you are chasing some dudes, in two you revisit areas from the first game, and in three you're  running errands for people. The RPG battle engine is pretty boring, the only strategy being save and restore until the enemy randomly picks the weakest attack a few times so you can stay alive long enough to kill him blah blah blah. You fight enemies in the usual touch combat way, which is not too annoying in this case. There is a good platforming engine and a kool room with spears that extend and retract through the walls.<br /><br />There are also some minor issues, like objects disguised as passages that tell you you can't use them (so annoying). And why does the player burn himself whenever he looks at fire goddammit"☃"1211651624"☃"kqzzt2.zip"☃"3.5"☃"142.167.31.25"
☃☃☃"Hot damn, an oldie that doesn't suck! ZapZak opens with either an impressive or horrifying title screen, depending on how you take it. Then you begin a short, seven board escape from a space penal colony.<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't spoil the puzzles, even though they're slider/sokoban stuff for the most part. The graphics are detailed (some boards having the maximum number of objects onscreen) and have a tendency to shift colour. References to Star Wars and pulp scifi and whatever give it a nice, corny vibe.  There is only one part where you can lose health, so this isn't one of those games where you slowly take more and more damage until there's no possible way to complete it without cheating. It also keeps track of your score vs the best possible score, if you're into that.<br /><br />Some objects that are supposed to die if surrounded don't seem too responsive, but otherwise, well done."☃"1211734349"☃"zapzak.zip"☃"4.5"☃"142.167.31.25"
☃☃☃"Nadir's screenshot post about Sivion made me remember that I hadn't actually completed it despite starting a few times. Generally remembering it in a good light, I took a crack at it again this evening.<br /><br />Sivion has a few neat short parts, but one the whole, it's a bad game.<br /><br />I started off pretty quickly, although it occurred to me that I just remembered all of the beginning trades and talking sequences from the times I first tried the game in 2004. What begins as an interesting quest to stock up on arrows and gems eventually becomes deadlock without cheating. It is so fucking easy to miss some necessary items and areas and yet keep bumbling on until their absence makes the game unwinnable. In one or two parts, buggy objects prohibit you from finishing without zapping. Many boss objects talk to you in blue message boxes while you're shooting them, which sucks because pressing shift and arrows in a message box closes it immediately. The game, which is superlocked, states in the editor that it has been beta tested and has no errors. &gt;:(<br /><br />Besides the obvious stuff, like having to input a password (which requires knowledge of some other game) to start playing, and the dark+invisible mazes, trading puzzles are often very obscure. There is no indication that some random conversation option is the only way to get a key, and that afterwards you'll never be able to get it again. Most conversations are displayed as flashy marquee text at the bottom of the screen, and two conversations have a tendency to overlap, making both unreadable. (Best example of this being the prison.) Every forest area is a ping-pong path maze begging to be zapped through. Most bosses, when shot, wait for one idle before zapping labels, meaning you can hammer a boss with most of your bullets and only deal one hit.<br /><br />The game feels like it's split into two bits: the first area which is generally crappier but more interesting, and the second area which has somewhat tighter programming but less going on.<br /><br />I do like some bits in Sivion, like the glinting, shiny gold in the mines, and the torture room. I also like how if you revisit the forum a new band will be playing. And the djinn store, that part is great. But god damn if it isn't one of the most tedious ZZT games I have ever played."☃"1211767918"☃"sivion.zip"☃"3"☃"142.167.31.25"
"that is some epic title music"☃☃☃"Warlord's temple starts slowly, and mostly involves item amassment and &quot;only being able to pick up items once you have a use for them&quot; type stuff. Over the course of the game (which is pretty short, only about sixteen gameplay boards), the player character gets spells and item upgrades, and builds up mana for when spellcasting is later introduced. There are some kinda clever parts and I like the game overall, enough to not mind the long walking distances.<br /><br />One hang-up: this is a beta version, and it's missing a board link to the ending. It will also set off some anticheat crap if you link it through the editor... The 1.0 release (probably?) fixes this and any other goofs."☃"1211776488"☃"wtemple.zip"☃"4"☃"142.167.31.25"
"An awe-inspiring synthesis of dramatic storytellin"☃"Gamer Dude 99"☃"gamerdude99@aol.com"☃"Nipple Saga is the most technically stunning ZZT game ever made. It's also a fine example of storytelling prowess within its medium, combining gameplay and narrative so slickly and beautifully that it's impossible to extricate one from the other. It's likely you will emerge awestruck from your first play-through, wishing the experience would continue yet nonetheless satisfied with its conclusion. It's difficult not to sound hyperbolic when discussing NS because every part of its design seemingly fulfills its vision, without compromise. There is no halfway.<br /><br />Fully realized, lengthy story sequences will come as no surprise to anyone who has played a Nipple game. You'll spend a good half of NS watching cinematics, but it would be a grave misinterpretation to assume that great gameplay takes a backseat to the story. Rather, these two elements are tightly intertwined, and this tapestry is held together by an important technical thread: Cutscenes that are rendered fully in real time within the game engine. It's impressive enough that these scenes look as good as any ZZT cinematic you've ever watched. It's even more amazing when those same scenes transition without pause into gameplay, and the same Robo Doctor you watched lumber about in the cinematic is looming above you. The subtle animations, the lush environments, and the rich textures are the same in and out of story sequences, and the effect is so seamless it may take your breath away. You can ?ZAP past the scenes if you prefer, but doing so would soften the experience. The story sequences carry more weight because of the intense gameplay that precedes them--and the gameplay feels more compelling because the story gives you powerful reasons to care about your mission. The high point of this fusion occurs in an exciting and memorable split-screen sequence that simply must be experienced.<br /><br />Talking about what, exactly, is going on in the plot in the midst of NS grand sweeping gestures is to risk spoiling each little surprise as it emerges. Nippleanus, suffering from the rapid onset of aging, now must cope with stiff joints in addition to the looming specter of Von Bagstein's newest plans. This is Nippleanus's final hurrah; yet as the story reaches one height after another, the juxtaposition of huge set piece battles and formidable bosses with Nippleanus's deteriorating body creates tension and gravity even beyond the series' usual pretensions. Some new plot strands emerge while others get tied up, and old friends (and enemies) refuse to be forgotten. You'll also bear witness to a few reunions--some bloody, some teary, and some legitimately shocking. Parts of it are overblown, to be sure. The musical score gets heavy-handed and the voice acting and writing are frequently dogmatic, so while there are plenty of subtle moments, subtlety isn't really NSs strong suit. But it doesn't need to be. After all, the fate of the world hangs in the balance, and judging from a few silly attempts at humor that don't work, developer Bigger Niggers were wise to err on the side of melodrama.<br /><br />The gameplay proper is familiar to fans, but it's been cleaned up and expanded, holding as many twists and surprises as the story. For starters, both gunplay and close-quarters combat are more satisfying. Regarding melee, the controls have been streamlined, making it less cumbersome to grab an enemy VBIRD or perform a stealthy blade kill. Shooting mechanics are even more improved, so much so that shooting your way out of a pickle is just as enjoyable as snacking on it. There are a huge number of weapons to play with; so many that you'll probably finish the campaign without using many of them. Yet, quality wasn't sacrificed for quantity: Every weapon feels just right, from your handy ZZT bullet (best when upgraded with a silencer) to the magic powers found in the RPG battles. The standard birds-eye view is fine for the most part, because you can't gaze down the sights from a first-person perspective.<br /><br />Not that you don't have all the tools for completely avoiding your enemies if you choose that route. Nippleanus's got the basics covered: crawling, hugging walls, peeking around corners, and hanging from ledges, for example. Cover mechanics are tighter than ever, so you can crouch and take potshots from behind cover with ease. There are also a number of important gadgets that will make your life easier in this regard. The most obvious of these is your Robodoctor suit, which takes on the texture of your surroundings when you're prone or pressed against cover. Not only does this make it simpler to avoid watchful eyes, but it's also a cool visual effect. Eventually, you'll be able to camouflage Nippleanus's head, and a few of the available camo options are bound to stir some fans' nostalgia. The Nipple Anus is your other major tool, as it expands your compass into a sonic-sensitive radar and allows you to use night vision and a tactical first-person view. These are helpful gadgets indeed, even during boss fights, like a stirring encounter in a blinding blizzard.<br /><br />Other gadgets, such as portable hiding places (cardboard boxes and rusty barrels) and the Robo Doctor (a stealthed robot that you can command as a scouting device), are useful to anyone who prefers the sneaky approach. Not every gadget is a welcome addition, though. For example, the much-ballyhooed NipPod is a neat touch, but to use it, you cannot have another gadget equipped, so you'll quickly forget the option even exists. But aside from these nitpicks, one of the things that makes the core gameplay so enjoyable is that you're rarely strapped into a single style of play. Shooting your way through requires more thought and care than you'd put into a standard action game, but you never feel as though the gun mechanics are stuffed uncomfortably into a stealth game. If you'd rather sneak, you never have the impression that stealth was shoehorned into a game that's meant to be played as a shooter. Sure, you're Nippleanus--you're not supposed to get caught. But if you're stuck in a jam, breaking stealth isn't a death sentence, and in fact, facing certain enemies head-on is often a heart-pounding, challenging experience. The few levels that do force you into one style, such as one in which you shadow your target through Kowloon City, are still great, if not quite as impactful.<br /><br />You'll need to keep an eye on Nippleanus's stress levels and psyche. Though these aspects are more peripheral than health levels, they fit nicely within the plot. When Nippleanus gets stressed (if he gets cold or hungry, for example), his psyche gauge starts to deplete. The lower the gauge, the slower you will move and the less quickly you replenish health. Generally speaking, the psyche meter is rarely a factor, and should you notice Nippleanus groaning a bit more, there are items like buns you can use for a pick-me-up. Should the meter get too low, you won't be able to hold up your weapon or rush for cover. This doesn't happen often though, and while you'll need to keep a close eye on your health for obvious reasons, you won't need to pay too much heed to psyche.<br /><br />Regardless of the tactics you use, the level design and enemy artificial intelligence work in tandem to create unparalleled gameplay. If you go stealth, hiding in that rusty barrel isn't a perfect solution. Your foe may look at it suspiciously, kick it a few times, and eventually blow your cover, so don't expect to be able to trick your way through as you might in other stealth games. In full-on firefights, enemy teams will flank you, use cover to their advantage, and throw grenades with precision to force you out of hiding. Most of your surroundings, inside and out, are littered with objects and cover opportunities, from a trek through Dir en Grey's house to a nostalgic journey through a convenience store. Each level is more-or-less linear, but within the confines of these areas, you still have remarkable room to explore the various gameplay options and test the limits of your foes. Some enemies are standard soldiers, though many others are wonderfully imaginative.<br /><br />Later in the game, a few set piece battles deepen the core gameplay even further, including a few peerless on-rails sequences. One of these, a motorcycle chase, is as close as any game has gotten to translating the excitement of similar moments in films to a game format. Another level, which features a gigantic automaton, showcases destructible environments where walkways collapse on top of each other and the screen fills with smoke. In all of these cases, the controls are excellent, with the exception of that same mech's third-person view a bit later on. The interpretation of Nipple as an interactive film still applies, but in a way you may not have expected: These levels make you feel like the star of your own action movie.<br /><br />Boss battles are stimulating, though they aren't all that difficult. Nevertheless, a few of them are tricky and require you to put some thought into your tactics because just riddling the boss with bullets isn't going to ensure victory. Early on, it's clear that you'll be encountering the four members of the VBIRDs unit--female supersoldiers that are as psychologically complex as they are fun to battle. These battles are long and normally require you to fight other enemies in addition to your primary target. In one of them, you can use your night vision to track your target's footprints and use the wind direction to your advantage. In another, you'll dodge missiles from flying creatures while taking on the main boss.<br /><br />The gameplay and story would, perhaps, not be as effective if Nipple Saga did not look and sound so impressive, but truth be told, it's an amazing piece of technology. From the gritty textures of concrete walls to the effective lighting and shadowing, there are few aspects you could reasonably fault. In the biggest battles, billows of smoke fill the screen and blood splatters against the camera--all while meticulously designed helicopters fly overhead and ad-hoc team members take potshots from behind grungy dilapidated vehicles. Yet in the midst of the visual drama, it's the little things that are likely to provoke awe. Small details, such as how Nippleanus rubs his sore back when his stress levels get high or the authentic manner in which he ascends staircases, create as much atmosphere as cluttered underground tunnels and war-torn safety offices. You will have to wait through some scattered install periods (just under 2 seconds worth, in total) and the occasional loading screen, and you may find some frame rate drops and non-STK here and there, but these aren't issues in light of NS's impressive graphical accomplishments.<br /><br />The sound design comes together nearly as well. The soundtrack on its own is rather pompous, but in context, it works just fine to create the appropriate mood for any given cutscene or battle. The voice acting follows suit but succeeds far better. Because the growling voice of Chase Bramlage's Nippleanus is so good, the rare hamming from the mostly excellent supporting cast is easily forgotten. But the sound effects are unforgettable and excellent across the board. Dir en Grey emit blood-curdling moos like gargantuan cows, explosions are outstandingly obnoxious, and everything from the clicks of the Nipple Anus to the laughter and screams of the beastly bosses are top-notch.<br /><br />On top of it all, Nipple Saga offers some enjoyable online 1-player action to complement its superb single-player experience.<br /><br />If the story-heavy presentation of previous Nipple games taxed your patience, Nipple Saga won't change your mind. For anyone who appreciates games that rise above the simple act of pushing a few buttons and pulling a few triggers, Nipple Saga is a stimulating ride that you won't soon forget. You'll want to see what happens next, yet when its long campaign draws to a close, you'll wish it would continue. That's not just because it's a well-told tale, but because that tale is woven through a thoroughly impressive game that tops its predecessors. "☃"1213743550"☃"Nipsaga.zip"☃"5"☃"93.96.139.237"

The title screen shows a scene of car falling off a cliff. This is not an accident, but the work of a saboteur.<br /><br />Our protagonist, Joshua Fury, goes about town, helping his fellow man on small or life-threatening occasions, trying to figure out who's responsible for the horrible carcrash.<br /><br />The gameplay is standard zzt adventure game fare, collecting the necessary items in order to progress (often entering a new building will require some key). The town inhabitants make their requirements to help you quite clear, which means you're mostly there to fetching their belongings, or stuff they 'require', because they're too lazy  to (or hospitalized) to do anything themselves.<br /><br />There is not a great deal of reading involved. Joshua doesn't say a thing, but when spoken to, you get to pick his replies. This doesn't give a real sense of character, but it makes you feel involved with the game, because it's so direct. The same goes for the story. It's not huge and evolving (though there is a twist in the end), but it's hermetic and it gives you a sense of purpose.<br /><br />The graphics are a bit basic. There is no stk (which actually has it's charm).  The grass has a nice random pattern, exemplary to modern games, but the rest of the graphics are essentially functional.<br /><br />It's a good game.

Yet, you do not have immediate access to all locations, so in some cases you need to buy an object or finish a quest in order to move on. <br /><br />The graphics are good. Better yet: original. The animations give the game a well-groomed look.<br /><br />Regarding the story: it's there to a small extent. The intro is nice and it states a purpose, making your goal clear from the beginning. There are no twists in the story and there is no actual building of character. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just makes the game what it is: a good-looking, well-executed, straight-forward RPG."☃"1215108467"☃"Solarwar.zip"☃"4.5"☃"77.250.253.45"
☃"RobertP"☃"plastikfish@hotmail.com"☃"Overflow is an epic action adventure.You are a male adolescent named Charlie, on a mission to take down the evil Achalon, who fucked up the planet and has control over time.<br /><br />The story is a mixture of biblical themes (Noah and the great flood, the apocalypse, armageddon) and science fiction elements (time travel, high-tech floating castles). The main character is a classic hero, with no other ambition than saving everything and everyone.<br /><br />You start out in a (post-)apocalyptic world, which still requires a force for good to triumph over evil. You seem a like convenient candidate!<br /><br />That you are. The action sets in right from the start of the game. Most of your enemies are colourful built-in tigers, but there are various other foes and dangerous contraptions. You'll collect loads of ammo on your way, for your trigger-happy enjoyment. There are a couple of bosses, including a barracuda! They're fun. Gameplay is further enhanced by a couple of clever puzzles and some conversing and object-gathering in familiar zzt-adventure fashion.<br /><br />What makes the game a gem is it's epic development. Your journey takes you around the world, even through space, exploring colourful islands, fortresses, ruins, jungles and villages on your way. The graphics are lush and very well made, with attention for background scenery, in a style that is somewhat reminiscent the excellent chockablock cartoon graphics Nadir has brought us humble zzt folk. There is a lot to see and the many boards offer a pleasant variety.<br /><br />The downsides are that the bosses are not very difficult. Achalon, the great evil superboss (for one of the endings) is a mope. There are also several references to Megazeux, which annoys me more than Allen Pilgrim's attempt to convert us to christianity. Let it not spoil the fun, Overflow's classic gameplay and beautiful graphics are still worth your while!<br /><br />"☃"1215638937"☃"overflow.zip"☃"4"☃"77.250.253.45"
"Lukewarm"☃☃☃"Coolness belongs to a second era of old school ZZT game design: one that came after the original Town of ZZT style, and died off around 1998-ish, as far as I can tell. It's a genre where every computer will fry you if you input a bad password, where purpose is sacrificed in lieu of having objects do odd things, where you sometimes have to touch objects twice to notice something odd about them, and where sometimes, just sometimes the author put a lot of work into cheat-proofing the game and it just comes off as kind of snotty and creepy. (My favourite quote: &quot;You didn't think I'd find out you used a cheat code did you? Well, you will die for this betrayal.&quot; ...WHAT?) If you can put up with those pratfalls, you get to see and do a few interesting things and try some interesting puzzles.<br /><br />You begin Coolness as Fletcher Long, probably a sixteen year old kid, sitting in a bank after helping out his father Marshall (manager of the bank). None of the tellers talk to Fletcher, and he wanders out of the bank and onto a road to pick up items and use them on other items for no apparent reason. This is another game where the main character will throw a hissy fit if you try to travel along a clearly placed road that actually has nothing beyond it. So the only places you can visit are along this road and inexplicably through a top-secret base located behind the backyard. Coolness is a branching game like Code Red, but here, you can FEEL when certain branches are being cut off, and it's intensely annoying.<br /><br />I'd rag on some of the stupidity contained in Coolness, but the fact is you should be able to reach at least one of the endings without much trouble. The graphics are very similar to Code Red and Sivion, two contemporary games Coolness is very similar to. Be aware that there are a couple of bugs (the game forgets to increase the gems variable when you search an object, then kills you if you cheat ... another reason to never put anti-cheat crap in your game.)<br /><br />Coolness is decent but it also shows the weaknesses of the branching design trend started with Code Red. In Town, you could go to any of the four areas, but you saw them all by the end of the game. Instead of one solid adventure, you get several diluted ones that all begin the exact same way and typically end with the same schtick. It's not a bad game, although it could be much less obtuse.<br /><br />(A much cooler game by the same author: Warlord's Temple)"☃"1219280135"☃"coolness.zip"☃"3.5"☃"142.167.10.27"
☃☃☃"Deep December is a dungeon crawl from the author of Asmodeus and Dungeon Master's Gallery. It's shorter and a bit easier (and a bit buggier) but it also sports the most features, and therefore it feels closer to its Roguelike roots than Testa's other crawls. It's also easier, but that's not a big issue for me since I died a lot but was still able to make progress. (Personally, I find Asmodeus practically unplayable.) One con: Text messages are displayed at the bottom of the screen, but you can't read them when you're getting mauled by enemies!

Although by no means perfect (christ, it's a contest entry), it's still a decent game, but there are a few labourious sections and a bit too much walking. The author's self-ribbing at the end is all on the mark. But! it's pretty good for 24 hours of work. Try some of the entries from the same contest and you will appreciate just how well crafted Nightplanet really is. Definitely a ZZT classic."☃"1219443905"☃"myth.zip"☃"4"☃"142.167.10.27"

It feels closer to Winter at points, which I guess was made around the same time, than it does to Nightplanet.<br /><br />Emptyspaces is decent, but it suffers from some common, easy-to-miss ZZT bugs that can unfortunately render the game unplayable without using the editor. I also completely missed an important item on a very flashy board, but maybe that was just me.<br /><br />Anyways, nicely done for a contest game, and its final section is much improved over the one in Nightplanet."☃"1220372701"☃"emptysp.zip"☃"4"☃"142.167.22.143"

The graphics are very nice for the most part, although there are a lot of fades and some parts just look like clutter, there are some really good looking boards. The story is nonsense, and this is not my thing. It's laid on thick and it is not easily ignored but there's not much you have to read to actually play the game. The gameplay is pretty straight forward, but doesn't really get going until about 30% of the way through the game and even then is lacklustre. I didn't beat the game. I got killed when I was teleported, I don't know if this is a bug or not, but I got enough of it to know what the rest was like I think.<br /><br />There are some RPG battles, nothing too new or exciting here, simply another vehicle for the odd humor.

End of plug.<br /><br />Eli's house is game involving a mysterious mansion. And this mansion is pretty decently deranged. There are action elements, including a couple of bosses, but exploring the mansion and solving puzzles are the main course. <br /><br />The story is rather obscure. You're a dude with a camera. I think you're on a mission of some kind, where you have to take pictures of weapons, but it's not important of the game at all.<br /><br />There are other people in the mansion. Apart from the staff - a burglar, a lady, a magician named Sintan and a reticent and self-serving fellow who calls himself Steadfast. Their roles are modest, but they do contribute to the development of the story. They also add to the general weirdness of the game.<br /><br />Gingermuffins makes great use of all<br />the colours in ZZT, but he's not afraid of using black. The colours make for pretty scenery and the black adds that special flavour of darkness &amp; mystery. Some boards are very nicely drawn, especially the outside view of the house and the balcony. There are a couple of neat animations, too.<br /><br />The length of the game is commendable. The game will taunt you, but your trails will not be in vain. You will be spending time looking for fake walls and stuff that you don't really need, but the more thorough your effort, the greater the reward in the end. <br /><br />In conclusion: this a great game. The people and the puzzles are weird, the story is vague and you hardly get to know the main characters of the game. But the game gives you just enough occasions to get involved, without taking any mystery away. And that's the main selling point: wandering around in a nicely decorated mystery, finding secrets around every corner of the game."☃"1228092395"☃"elis_h_1.1.zip"☃"4.5"☃"82.215.43.205"

The premise is simple: you are faced with a gauntlet, involving the destruction of built-in enemies, solving little puzzles, collecting supplies and a lot of running around. With this type of gameplay, dosage and variety are key. Thankfully, Commodore got it right: both in concept and graphics, The Challenge is a traditional ZZT game that delivers exactly what it should.<br /><br />The game makes a lot of use of (non-programmable) built-in attributes. This means you will be destroying breakables with bears and bears with boulders. The game doesn't rely exclusively on built-in objects and their limitations, there's the occasional button and even a mid-game boss, which is always a plus.<br /><br />Graphically, the Challenge is colourful and conventional. The exterior fits the general feel of the game. It makes you feel like you're getting somewhere, too.<br /><br />The game lives up to it's name: it's a difficult son of a mother.

I didn't check, but if there isn't there should be.<br /><br />nice title screen too<br /><br />keep it up man<br /><br />"☃"1257125004"☃"MF.zip"☃"3.5"☃"97.115.14.1"

"something new"☃"RobertP"☃"plastikfish@hotmail.com"☃"<br />In Diggaman, you explore caverns, picking up keys, gems and other useful items while investigating the disappearance of your brother, a geologist. It combines puzzle and dexterity elements with 'dungeon'-style gameplay in a fun but somewhat unforgiving way.<br /><br />The game mainly makes use of built-in functionss of ZZT. One is slightly tuned: you dig using ammo, destroying a group of rocks (a breakable) directly in front to you. It's pretty linear, with some additional (hidden) paths and bonus-caves.<br /><br />A mining camp is your base. It's a campfire and couple of tents and it has the function of a town in an RPG: it's where you return after completing a  there's a market for gems and other collectables. It's also where you notice most of the progress in the game. Eventually, you reach the final mine, defeat your nemesis and save your brother.<br /><br />The gameplay is challenging, a nice take on the dungeon-exploration genre.  The font, the style and the gameplay work well together. There are secrets in the walls and other unexpected encounters in the mines. I also like how his task is implied by his name, like with Gem Hunter. And there's a boss fight. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the game has a couple of flaws. Items are scarce, there's a lot of trial and error and the game gives very few directions. The caves and tunnels are well designed, but it's possible to get stuck in many ways. I couldn't get past one particular puzzle for a long time - it seemed to require impossible timing and I zapped my way out. <br /><br />The game is pretty hard: both for good (you have to be careful and adaptive) and for bad (you wander around and get stuck). Still, the game is enjoyable, it's (visual) design stands out and has a very characteristic feel. <br /><br />Thumbs up!"☃"1263684702"☃"DIGGAMAN.zip"☃"4"☃"77.250.36.230"

Often times I think the crudeness of the language sometimes deceives players of Raze's games into overlooking how detailed the plots actually are. You know... detailed for ZZT games.<br /><br />The pacing of this game is what makes it great. There's little bits of adventure balanced perfectly with little plot interludes. The game isn't particularly hard, but the challenges are varied.

"Fantastic game."☃"SaxxonPike"☃"saxxonpike@gmail.com"☃"I finally got around to beating this game without the use of the hint file! It was not easy and there were certainly some frustrating moments. Luckily there are some options to make your game easier for when you seem stuck. And I guess there's the hint file too if you are pulling your hair out.<br /><br />The use of the inventory engine is top-notch. Best use of inventory I've ever seen. The puzzle sequences are a blast.<br /><br />I wasn't a big fan of most of the action scenes though. The sidescroller in Burns's ending infuriated me (I was not able to complete this ending).<br /><br />The game's dialog is absolutely hilarious. I think the only real letdown was Nyarlethole at the end. It makes sense, but I wasn't expecting something this cheesy. The very final board is the only saving grace for the ending - I totally forgot about him!<br /><br />The graphics are very well done. I think there were some parts of the game that could've done with a little extra coding in order to make changes on the board a little neater, but that's a nitpick. The static graphics are very pleasing. Check out Sweeneyland's detail, wow.<br /><br />A must-play.

Much like the title suggests, it looks easy, but has many surprises, all of them highly original, utilizing only built in objects. Each little box is a puzzle that forms part of the larger puzzle. Often you must be careful as to what state you leave a box in, since you might have to traverse it again, sometimes from a different direction. There's so much crammed into one board it is overwhelming. Since the boards wraparound, you will have to do some mental gymnastics to plan your next move.
