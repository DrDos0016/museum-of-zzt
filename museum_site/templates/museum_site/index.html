<h1>z2 - The ZZT Archive</h1>

<p>Welcome to z2. A website originally created for the ZZT community to share their games and interact with fellow ZZTers. After years of stagnation, the site has been redeveloped from scratch
 with a new purpose of historical preservation of everything ZZT.</p>

<p>If you've never played ZZT before, or haven't touched it in years, check out the <a href="/article/5/getting-started-with-zzt">Getting Started With ZZT</a> article, to get yourself ready
to experience 25 years of a gaming subculture unlike any other.</p>
