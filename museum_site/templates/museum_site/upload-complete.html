<h1>Upload Complete</h1>
<p>The following file has been added to the upload queue. Please wait patiently for it to be published. Typically publication occurs when the queue has twelve or more uploads, though this is not a hard rule.</p>

<p>If you have discovered an error with your uploaded file, or its data, you may edit it prior to its publication/rejection using the following edit token:
<b><a href="{% url 'upload' %}?token={{upload.edit_token}}">{{upload.edit_token}}</a></b></p>

<p>This token has been saved in your visitor session, but only the most recently used token will be stored. Consider registering an account to avoid the need for entering a token to edit an upload.</p>
