<p>Featured Worlds are worlds which have been recognized as important, deemed noteworthy, or otherwise celebrated within the ZZT community. Featured Worlds on the Museum of ZZT consist of worlds which have newly been awarded featured status as well as historical award winners of coveted community awards including "Game of the Month, "Classic Game of the Month", "Featured Game", and others. Traditionally, these worlds are accompanied by one of more reviews to mark their status.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that some older awards may reflect tastes of a different era, or have been awarded to titles in quieter months with limited competition. Even so, the Featured World list is a reasonable starting point for anyone interested in what historically were considered stand-out titles.</p>
