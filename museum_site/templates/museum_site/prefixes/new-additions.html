<p>The New Additions page lists all files hosted in the Museum of ZZT's file archives sorted by publication date. This is essentially a full list of all files hosted excluding currently unpublished worlds (which may be found on the <a href="{% url 'uploaded_worlds' %}">Upload Queue</a> page).</p>

<p>The Museum's database did not track publication dates at first. For publication dates prior to Nov. 7th, 2018, the publication date will be considered "Unknown". Beyond this point, sorting is done by the file's ID in descending order which is reasonably accurate to the order the files were added to the Museum's archives. Eventually this number also becomes inaccurate as the original database was populated from z2's database which neither numbered nor timestamped its files.</p>
