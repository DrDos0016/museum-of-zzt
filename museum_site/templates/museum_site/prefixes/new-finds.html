<p>The New Finds page lists files which are not new creations, but older titles that were not readily accessible prior to publication on the Museum of ZZT. These files come from old websites (often preserved via <a href="https://archive.org" target="_blank">The Internet Archive</a>) as well as donations of ZZTer's own collections.</p>

<p>This list is not exhaustive due to publication dates not being tracked prior to Nov. 7th, 2018.</p>

<p>Files with unknown release dates are also considered New Finds, though this isn't guaranteed to be accurate.</p>
