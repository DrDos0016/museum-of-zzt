<p>Scrolls of ZZT are hand-picked moments of some of the more iconic, interesting, humorous, or just plain weird bits of text to be found in various ZZT worlds. Consider these to be a "ZZT without any context" ...except all Scrolls have context provided with links to the file the line originates from, as well as a direct link to where in the file the line appears.</p>

<p>Enjoy the inanity!</p>
