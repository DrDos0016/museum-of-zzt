<h1>Removal Policy</h1>
<p>The Museum of ZZT is dedicated to preserving ZZT and its culture for better
or for worse. Removal is strongly discouraged as all content removed is a part
of ZZT's history. Though sometimes juvenile or embarassing to witness today,
this content is a wonderful source of independent game developers' creativity.
You are urged to reconsider removal as its effects on preservation are likely
far stronger than any personal benefit from removing this content.</p>

<p>That being said, the original authors of these worlds still retain full
ownership of the content they have produced and may opt out of having their past
works shared. This may be specific content, or a full withdrawal from the site.
</p>

<p>The Museum is open to modifying database information to replace an author
of a file with "Unlisted" signifying the author's request for privacy if this
is the underlying issue. (The hosted files will not be modified and may still
contain identifying information.) This should at least be sufficient enough to
prevent the data from being crawled by indexers.</p>

<p>Removal from the Museum consists of all of the following being removed:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Hosted files (ZZT worlds, utilities, etc.) and their associated
    content (reviews, screenshots, articles, wiki content)</li>
    <li>Reviews the requestor has published on other worlds</li>
    <li>Articles specifically or heavily focusing on the requested file</li>
    <li>The wiki page for the file</li>
</ul>

<p>This content may also be removed from z2 as well by mutual administrators
between the two sites.</p>

<p>Please note that removal from the Museum does NOT include remove from
archive.org's ZZT collection.</p>

<p>Removed content may be reinstated later at the author's request.</p>

<p>All that being said, if you wish for some of your content to be removed from
the project, please contact <a href="mailto:{{EMAIL_ADDRESS}}?subj=Museum Content Removal">Dr. Dos</a>
with detailed information on what content you wish to see deleted.</p>
