<h1>Featured Games</h1>
{% if page == 1 %}
<p>Featured games, are games which have been deemed unique in some way as an example of what ZZT has to offer. These game worlds generally show a higher quality than most, and have been given their place in the spotlight.</p>

<p>In the past, a Game of the Month award was given to worlds which were deemed the best released that month. A Classic Game of the Month award was given to a game released at any time. Eventually these awards ceased, until years later when Featured Games brought the idea of the Classic Game of the Month back.</p>

<p>Additionally, a renowned community member MadTom ran his own award series, MadTom's Pick, which filled the role of the Game of the Month.</p>

<p>All of these worlds that received these awards along with their reviews have been merged into the Featured Games list. If you would like to write about a game which showcases excellence in ZZT in some way, please do! This list is far from complete and could certainly use new additions.</p>

<p>With that said, here are the current Featured Games:</p>
