<h1>Genre Overview</h1>

<article>
<p>Files uploaded to the Museum of ZZT require at least one genre to help categorize the content contained within it. Below are some loose descriptions to help decide which genres should be set when uploading a file and what to expect when browsing published files. This list is subjective and intended to help make certain types of files easier to find and properly tag.</p>

<p>The goal of genre tags is to help visitors to the Museum of ZZT more capable of finding the kind of ZZT worlds they are interested in. This goal is considered when altering a file's genres to add or remove labels. Due to the volume of files hosted on the Museum, it is not safe to assume that all files have only genres that accurately reflects the file's contents nor is it safe to assume that a file that lacks a particular genre correctly lacks it.</p>

<p>Genres are initially set when uploading a file to the Museum at the uploader's discretion. For files uploaded by users other than the file's author, these genre tags may not fully reflect the author's perception of what genres should/should not apply.</p>

<p>For a list of genres without any descriptions and the ability to filter the list, see the <a href="{% url 'directory' 'genre' %}">genre directory</a> page.</p>
