I attempted a comic the year after but it was an unscripted disasterpiece of cross-hatching that I eventually threw away after quitting a few pages in (after redrawing it for the first few pages of this). HOPEFULLY this will be better, even though it\'s probably pretty rough around the edges; I\'ve never bothered with a comic before, even though I love the medium!</p>\n\n<p>No, it\'s not a furry comic.

INSERT INTO `z2_site_article` VALUES (1,'About ZZT','ZU','Help','ZZT is an ANSI-based computer game, created in 1991 by Tim Sweeney of Epic Games (then Epic Megagames), who later designed Unreal. ZZT\'s name was chosen so it would be last in software catalogs, and does not actually stand for anything. It most definitely does not stand for \"Zoo of Zero Tolerance.\"\r\n\r\nZZT\'s graphics were obsolete before it was even created; it used the same style of text-mode graphics that Kingdom of Kroz used 4 years earlier. However, ZZT managed to become fairly popular because of its integration of a simple but effective object-oriented scripting language known as ZZT-OOP. At the time, this was groundbreaking, as most functionality in prior games had been hard-coded. The language allowed extensibility that no other game was able to provide, and allowed a large degree of community involvement that extended far beyond simply creating level terrain with the built-in editor but involved writing programs to make the game run.\r\n\r\nOriginally ZZT was shareware, with only one of the four level-sets or \"worlds\" released without payment. The shareware versions also included Demo of ZZT, which displayed the basic features of ZZT worlds, and Tour of ZZT, which allowed the player to view select rooms (some playable) of the four worlds. Three different versions of shareware ZZT were released, with three corresponding registered ZZT versions. With about 30,000 registrations worldwide, ZZT was successful enough to finance the production of Jill of the Jungle, a game seen as Epic Megagames\' answer to Apogee classics such as Duke Nukem. However, when the game became obsolete it became freeware, with all four worlds of the registered version released for free. The worlds are: \"Town of ZZT\", \"Caves of ZZT\", \"City of ZZT\" and \"Dungeons of ZZT\". They can best be described as adventure games.\r\n\r\n    Town of ZZT.\r\n\r\n    Caves of ZZT.\r\n\r\n    City of ZZT.\r\n\r\n    Dungeons of ZZT.\r\n\r\nIn the newsletters for the registered version of ZZT, it is apparent that Sweeney initially had not expected the editor to become the most popular feature of his game. Fans\' letters to him quickly established this, and Sweeney responded by encouraging registered users to make their own worlds and submit them to him. The best material from these was released in The Best of ZZT.\r\n\r\nThird-party worlds for ZZT are diverse; they range from shoot \'em ups to complex role playing games to a Lemmings clone. They range from the simple to the complex, from inane to brilliant. One of the more fascinating aspects of the game is the culture that has built up within and around it, such as catchphrases, programming tricks, and even some rather remarkable internet personalities. Many other games have been inspired from ZZT such as MegaZeux, and ZZT\'s sequel: Super ZZT. Mods to ZZT itself are rare, because Tim Sweeney lost the source code in a hard drive crash years ago.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been many years since Tim Sweeney first wrote ZZT, it still has a cult following, with many external utilities and advanced editors such as KevEdit and ZZTAE created to enhance the ZZT experience. Many have also been initiated into programming by applying it as a stepping stone.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary or enduringly popular classic third-party ZZT games include kudzu, p0p, Teen Priest, Bizanloo, Warlock Domain, Psyche, Burger Joint, and Sivion. Popular authors include drac0, cly5m, tucan, Madguy, and Zenith Nadir. Recent popular productions released on z2 include Frost 1: Power, Evil Sorceror\'s Party - a four-file Epic held by many to be the best ZZT game ever made, Mooseka Rules with an Iron Fist, and Thug Life 2.

Nearly every game is designed to be played in this version which was released as freeware by Epic in 1997. Older versions, shareware variants, and fan hacks are also available for completion\'s sake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take note that ZZT is an MS-DOS game, and will not run on modern systems without running in an emulator such as <a href=\"http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1\">Dosbox</a>.

The setup screen is bland. The included version of Town of ZZT has a different title screen. There\'s a different exit screen. In the world list having a file named PHYSICS.ZZT will display The Physics Behind ZZT, a world which was never released.<br>\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Unofficial Releases</h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<b>Release:</b> ZZT 4.0<br>\r\n<b>Creator:</b> WiL<br>\r\n<b>Information:</b> ZZT v4.0 is an unofficial hacked version of ZZT which makes several useful changes to ZZT. The following is taken from its text file: <br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n“ZZT\'s notorious 20k board limit has now been increased to a healthier 32k. ZZT\'s equally notorious bottom-row placement bug has been fixed. ZZT\'s annoying water-glink sound effect is now removed. ZZT is now 39k, smaller than the original executable. Textual changes - also, UNTITLED.ZZT, TEMP.BRD, and SAVED.SAV will no longer be the default. Now by default you must put in a name of your own. This means no more angst over accidentally saving over your last board, saved game, or ZZT project.”\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNote that while this version increases the maximum memory a board can use, it does not increase the maximum memory a world can use. Be careful if you are designing a large ZZT world which also requires large board sizes.\r\n</div>','','2015-05-27',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(3,'Ascii Character Reference','Unknown','Help','<table

The ZZT executable will allow you to play and edit worlds. You\'ll first need to download <a href=\"/zgames/z/zzt.zip\">ZZT 3.2</a>\r\n before anything else. (Other <a href=\"/article/2/zzt-versions\">ZZT versions</a> are also available, though 3.2 is the standard.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As ZZT is a 16-bit MS-DOS program, it will no longer run on natively on modern PCs. Fortunately modern systems running any major operating system should be able to run ZZT \r\nby downloading and installing <a href=\"http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1\">DOSBox</a>, a DOS emulator for running old games and software on modern machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you\'ve downloaded both of these programs, you\'ll have everything you need to get started with ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Extract ZZT</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Begin by opening zzt.zip. You\'ll see a list of all the files included with the registered version of ZZT 3.2. Extract all of the files into a folder which you\'ll use for ZZT. You \r\ncan do this either by dragging and dropping all the files in the zip to the folder of your choice, or right click and select extract all and choose a destination.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>Setting Up Dosbox</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Run the DOSBox installer executable file, and complete the process.</p>\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\Dos\\AppData\\Local\\DOSBox\\dosbox-0.74.conf\r\n\r\n<p>Open the configuration file in notepad or another basic text editor and scroll down to the very end of the file where you\'ll find the <b>[autoexec]</b> heading</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You\'ll want to set up DOSBox to automatically create a virtual hard drive based on the folder you installed ZZT to. Do this by adding the following to the config:</p>\r\n\r\nmount C C:\\path\\to\\zzt\r\nC:\r\n\r\n<p>This will make DOSBox automatically set up the virtual hard drive and switch to it when you run the program. You may now run DOSBox and be ready to play.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Play ZZT Worlds</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Run DOSBox and your configuration will kick in and mount the virtual hard drive. From the DOSBox command line, simply type zzt and hit enter to run the program!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You\'ll see this configuration screen for ZZT. Get used to it, you\'ll have to specify these options every time you launch the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keyboard input is generally preferred, however DOSBox does have minor issues with the way ZZT checks for keys which makes the player move a bit sluggishly when first inputting a \r\ndirection. This can make combat in more fast paced games more difficult than intended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mouse input is almost never used. It makes precise movements essentially impossible. There are a few ZZT games which were designed around mouse input such as <a href=\"TODO\">4</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joystick input is the last option, provided DOSBox detects a gamepad. You will have much more fluid movement in DOSBox with this option, but ZZT only recognizes two buttons, meaning \r\neither a keyboard or Joystick mapping tool like <a href=\"http://joytokey.net/en/\">JoyToKey</a> is needed for handling saving or lighting torches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next choice is Color or Monochrome mode. Monochrome will run the game only using the black, white, and the two shades of gray ZZT has available. Color is the standard choice.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The main program will load and you\'ll see a message stating that this version of ZZT is registered and not to be distributed. (ZZT was released as freeware in 1997 so you may \r\ndisregard this message).

It features a larger scrolling playfield, direct access to the entire 16 color palette, increased limitations with flags and a custom counter, and a variety of new built in enemies and terrain. However, its editor was originally kept hidden and tends to be buggy. In order to be able to access the editor, the program must be launched as \"SUPERZ.EXE /e\".

It features significant improvements over ZZT\'s static text mode graphics and colors.

Also because once in awhile somebody asks about them. These magic external programs are known as Font Mania (which many are at least vaguely familiar with) and the new guy Blinkx (which shows that Zeuxworld can do something useful once).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>The Overview</h2><br>\r\nA quick glance at these programs to find out what they do would be something like FONT MANIA allows you to modify the traditional ascii font to something more related to your game (that player will SMILE <I>NO MORE</I>). This requires a quick switch in Font Mania\'s options as well as a .bat file (file of specific instructions to be handled automatically so you don\'t manually load up the font).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Blinkx you\'ll simply be making a .bat file for zzt (and if needed one for your external editor so you can see how the game will look as you make it). Blinkx stops chars from blinking replacing them with BRIGHT BACKGROUNDS. Allowing for pretty new color combinations and better graphics in general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Making a Pretty Font</h2><br>\r\nAh games with fonts. Once incredibly neat things, now very rare. You can make some mean looking games with these things. The first thing you\'ll be doing is loading up Font Mania located at http://zzt.org/zgames/f/fm.zip . Sorry boys, you\'ll have to copy and paste that yourself. As soon as you extract it you\'ll have a few example fonts as .com files. If you go right in and make a font there\'d be a problem in that ZZT would cut off the last few rows from sight. This is because font Mania defaults to a 16 point font (fancy sounding indeed). ZZT uses a 14 point font. So, before you do any editing you\'ll want to hit ALT-O to open the font menu and change to 14 points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>CRAZY FONT MANIA PROBLEMS</h2><br>\r\nThis didn\'t happen to me on the old windows 95 computer from years ago, but for some people running font mania in full screen causes you to not see the blocks as you change them in the zoomed char. Simply ALT-Enter to window it and see everything. However, this causes another problem, now the zoom works, but the preview doesn\'t. Simply do your little editing and ALT-Enter back to fullscreen to check it out, then put it in a window again. It\'s kind of annoying but you\'ll manage I\'m sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Using Blinkx</h2><br>\r\nBlinkx is neat. You don\'t need to do anything but go to the Blinkx batch file section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Font Batch Files</h2><br>\r\nNow you have your font and would like to make your little package so people can play it as intended. A typical batch file for a font looks like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<TABLE>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">@echo off</span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nTells your batch file not to display all the commands it\'s entering.\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\"><fontname> i</span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nInstall this font (actually i don\'t know what the i means!)\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">zzt <game.zzt></span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nRun Zzt. Load Game.zzt on startup.\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\"><fontname> u</span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nUninstall this font (lucky guess?)\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">echo <crazymessage></span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nEnd the batch file display a message usually \\\"THANKS FOR PLAYING\\\" or something dumb like that.\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<br>\r\nSo once your font and game are complete and you\'re ready to package them, you\'ll want to go into notepad and write a batch file like this one. Please note having a message at the end is purely optional as is loading a game right away. However seeing as how you probably made a font for your specific game you should do the nice man a favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>What to Include in Your Custom Font Game</h2><br>\r\nBesides the typical requirements, the game and a text file. You\'ll also want to include the .com file of your font, and your .bat file. It\'s good practice to use similar if not the same names. Using something like Space.zzt, Castle.bat, MadTom.com, and Drussrox.txt would be frowned upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Blinkx Batch Files</h2><br>\r\nThis is nearly identical to the font files just with a few tweaks. SEE THE FOLLOWING:<br>\r\n\r\n<TABLE CLASS=\\\"none\\\">\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">@echo off</span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nTells your batch file not to display all the commands it\'s entering.\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">blinkx i</span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nInstall this super program BLINKX\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">zzt <game.zzt></span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nRun Zzt. Load Game.zzt on startup.\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">blinkx u</span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nUninstall this super program BLINKX\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n<TD>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">echo <crazymessage></span>\r\n</TD>\r\n<TD>\r\nEnd the batch file display a message usually \\\"THANKS FOR PLAYING\\\" or something dumb like that.\r\n</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>What to Include in Your Blinkx Game</h2><br>\r\nWell, there\'s the obvious game and text files. Despite all those random files included in the blinkx zip you only need blinkx.com. And as stated above, it\'s good practice to use similar if not the same names. Using something like Space.zzt, Castle.bat, MadTom.com, and Drussrox.txt would be frowned upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Configuring External Editors to work with your font/blinkx</h2><br>\r\nFirst off the WINDOWS version of kev-edit obviously will not work with. As for the regular editor you can just use the examples shown above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you use Zztae.bat/.exe create this batch file:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">echo off<br>\r\nblinkx i<br>\r\nzztae.bat/.exe </span>(depending on the extension)<br>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">blinkx u<br>\r\necho</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you use the Dos version of kevedit:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"mono\">echo off<br>\r\nblinkx i<br>\r\nkevedit.exe<br>\r\nblinkx u<br>\r\necho</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSO THERE YOU HAVE IT FOLKS - Dos<br>','<style>\r\narticle .mono\r\n{\r\n    font-family:monospace;\r\n}\r\n</style>','2011-09-10',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(9,'Aura Walkthrough','Dr. Dos','Walkthrough','The Official Aura Strategy Guide!\r\n\r\nBecause many testers are getting killed at like level 3!\r\n\r\nWARNING AND SUCH: This guide has lots of spoilers and I suggest you don\'t read it because you\'ll be less of a man if you do.\r\n\r\nSO THEN\r\n\r\nLevel 1: Let\'s Begin\r\nYou better not die here. You start with a red aura so kill a bunch of reds. Make sure you get that red key because I think you\'ll need it. You can ignore the lower right section, that key is a fake, if you touch it, it becomes a level 2 blue. You won\'t see too many fake keys like this because I get lazy. I think you can figure out how to beat this level.\r\n\r\nLevel 2: Parenthesis\r\nFull of level 2 enemies people somehow still find this level to be difficult. When you start switch to a blue aura, and head to the lower left section of the parenthesis taking out blues. Since they\'re fast you can get most of them out of the way before you go after the greens. Then head to the upper right corner and carefully get the blue key doing whatever the hell you want. Switch to red and plow through the lower left corner.\r\n\r\nLevel 3: Box\r\nOk this level makes people cry as they are rushed. Switch to red and take out the lower half reds first. If you do it quickly the greens won\'t get to you in time. I can\'t be too specific since I\'m only looking at the boards and trying to remember what I\'ve been doing. Most levels only the start is hard though. So don\'t worry if I\'m too vague.\r\n\r\nLevel 4: Key Graveyard\r\nSwitch to blue, kill the blue ones, switch to green, kill greens, switch to red, kill reds. All those keys except for 3 are mimics, but you do know that if your aura matches you\'ll kill the mimic before it can move. So do that until you find the keys. Treating the \"graves\" as a grid with 1,1 in the lower left you\'ll want: 5,2 and 3,3 for the blue and red keys on the LEFT. On the right section you\'ll want 5,3\r\n\r\nLevel 5: Ghost Town\r\nSwitch to red and kill all of them, grab the health. If you haven\'t figured it out the real keys are left in those \"abandoned\" buildings. But wait! When you go for the blue key have a red aura. For the green key use blue, and for the red key use green. When you enter the final building you\'ll face all 3 of them at once so switch to blue and get rid of them, take out the green and lastly the red and LEAVE.\r\n\r\nLevel 6: Air Temple\r\nStolen from ADOM! Switch to green and take out a bunch of them first. Take out one side\'s worth of reds (east or west it doesn\'t matter). Grab the two keys SWITCH TO BLUE and open a door. The enemies will pour out and die. Grab the blue key and win.\r\n\r\nLevel 7: Pac Mania\r\nThis was supposed to be level 3 but it came out too hard. It\'s funny because it\'s so easy now for me. Switch to green and go down to the vertical lines and leave the hearts so it\'s harder for things to get in. Head out the bottom when you can and grab the green key. The top right red key is a mimic so ignore it. Go to the lower left and grab the other keys. make your way to the center and win.\r\n\r\nLevel 8: Stone Circle\r\nThe other ADOM level. Grab the hearts. When you grab the one that opens the main room the enemies will move. The trick is to stay in the little narrow passage so the enemies will have to move DOWN one tube and RIGHT in the other. This gives you plenty of time to kill things. Eventually there will be some that won\'t go in so FLOOR IT because you\'ll probably have the 3 keys by this point.\r\n\r\nLevel 9: Soundwave\r\nBlue aura. Kill the blues, then the greens. Avoid the top row until you\'re ready to avoid other enemies rushing in. You can make a run for the two keys on the right side. When get the blue key start heading west, but then go east and wrap around near the border. once you\'re on the left half you\'re pretty much safe.\r\n\r\nLevel 10: The Love of a Bomb and a Key\r\nOnce again switch to blue. Head to the lower left to take out the level 3 blues. Then get the greens out. Use the hearts below the right key to avoid enemies rushing in. You can take out a lot of blue and green this way. You get the idea.\r\n\r\nLevel 11: Mushroom Garden\r\nHey switch to blue. A large amount of them will charge at you. You may lose some health to a stray green or two. Really once you get rid of the blues you can pretty easily avoid the reds and take out the greens.\r\n\r\nLevel 12: Bridge Warfare\r\nThis one looks really bad, but it\'s pretty simple. Switch to RED and head left. Kill all 9 of them, then switch to blue and kill that batch. By this point the second wave of reds will scatter around allowing blues to get through take them out and if you get a lull in blues that break the reds on the right half take out some western reds. Repeat this with the right half when you get the keys.\r\n\r\nLevel 13: Borealus\r\nOH LOOK NO ENEMIES. You know right away they\'ll jump out at you BUT WHEN? They\'ll do that one you get the white key. When you go into the crazy spiral shit goes down, BUT IT DOESN\'T HAVE TO. All the invisible enemies (the water walls) CAN be killed before they are active by touching them with the right aura. Making it possible to win without losing any health.\r\n\r\nLevel 14: All Hell Breaks Loose\r\nHmmm what did I do on this one? :( I do know that as tempting as staying the heart field is, it\'s a bad idea. I think you want to use a pulse here. Which is the name I\'ve given to changing to a green aura when there\'s tons of level 4 enemies in an open area. The go in, and pulse outward and it\'s pretty cool because as long as you\'re cautious you can keep using the pulse technique when greens get near and then switch back to blue or something. I do know it\'s best to stay in the inner jagged line at first so as to not die.\r\n\r\nLevel 15: Crazy Eights\r\nThis is where the game really becomes a dick. You\'re on level 15/25 so don\'t give up all hope. Actually you probably should as I write this I\'ve only done the levels around this point in tests where i had max health and then recorded my health when I beat the level to see if it was too difficult plus I was getting good at this game and you\'re pretty screwed. Anyways I THINK you\'d wand to switch to blue and run all crazy like trying to get rid of them. Getting the blue key should be easy then with just 4 level 3 reds to kid. Then swoop up with green to get the red key. And uh get the green key somehow.\r\n\r\nLevel 16: Conehead\r\nYou\'re in for a break. This level is a bit too easy because it involves madtom and we all know how easy he is ;). Change to blue and then when the time is right green and you pretty much beat the level.\r\n\r\nLevel 17: Symmetry Vs. Strategy\r\nThis one was the last designed level. I hate to say it but it\'s a fucking terrible level. I think I beat it once ever outside of testing. So here\'s what to do. STAY IN THE WORLD\'S SMALLEST BOTTLENECK FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. When there\'s a lull in enemies then grab the heart and kill the greens to add some room. Be careful not to switch auras and kill the water leaving you vulrnerable.\r\n\r\nLevel 18: Earthquake\r\nThe design on paper was a billion times better than this. It also happens to be kind of easy, but only if you don\'t rush through the level. Slowly make progress around corners killing nearly everything before you grab the keys. It\'s not that bad.\r\n\r\nLevel 19: Face of Death\r\nZelda Skull represent \\m/. I\'m pretty sure the strategy here is actually to grab the blue key right away and cut across the top of the skull and grab the red key, wrap around the triangular triforce and get the green key and fucking run. No guarentees man.\r\n\r\nLevel 20: Town of ZZT\r\nPULSE PULSE PULSE.\r\n\r\nLevel 21: A Diamond is Forever\r\nI can\'t remember a damn thing about this level. I\'m guessing start with blue, kill some green and get out of the center. It\'s probably a good idea to get the keys from the back where there\'s no enemies at first. Also make sure not to make trips longer than they have to be. Blue, Red, Green would do nicely letting you run one track.\r\n\r\nLevel 22: Cranks and Nuts\r\nWell, switch to blue, and take advantage of the crammed areas near the blue and green key. Use the narrow bottom of the level to take out the left side to easily get the red key. I think.\r\n\r\nLevel 23: Paragon\r\nLooking back this level would\'ve been harder if the keys were the bottlenecks and the lines enlarged in the center. Of course the reds get to you too quickly to use the bottlenecks. It\'s best to plow left killing blue and letting them come to you there.\r\n\r\nLevel 24: Clockwork\r\nOk bitches I know you\'re excited. Level 24/25. I think you use a pulse in this level after killing the blue. Of course by this time your health is like 250 thanks to getting 240 for reaching level 24. The trick to this level is finding the red blue and green keys without running in circles with wrong keys. 3:00, 5:00, and 10:00 are the answer to that. Originally this level had 12 switches in the clock and then a timer would go up from 00:00 to 12:00 but it was pretty pointless since testing showed 99% of the level was dead when you hit the 12th switch.\r\n\r\nLevel 25: Ground Zero\r\nYou must be confused. Level 25 has level 3 enemies? Well shut up it\'s a blessing. It\'s just BOX with all the enemies upgraded. I\'ve yet to find a good way to handle this one. The reds are close enough to get to you, the greens are fast enough to get to you, the blues are obviously fast enough and it\'s just chaos. Just make sure you take the red door on the left. The one on the right is like a SUPER MIMIC who becomes level 3 or 4 or something. It\'s now or NEVER.\r\n\r\n\\m/ ENDINGS \\m/\r\n\r\noh shit IT\'S NOT OVER YET BOYS! Now you have to get one of 7 endings. Which endings are accessable are based on your little results.\r\n\r\nIf you have more torches than gems or score scroll down to Level 26A: Golmon\'s Lair\r\nIf you have more score than torches or gems scroll down to Level 26B: Dimitri\'s Lair\r\nIf you have more gems than torches or score scroll down to Level 26C: Enerjak\'s Lair\r\nIf you get the white part on top to clear path for you scroll down to Level 26D: Oxygoth\'s Lair\r\nIf you get the blue part to disappear and the passage is towards the bottom of the screen you\'re ending will be interesting for one and go to Level 26E: Null\'s Lair\r\n\r\n\\m/ INTENSIVE SPOILERS AWAIT \\m/\r\n\r\nLevel 26A: Golmon\'s Lair\r\nGolmon. Golem. Monster. Golem Monster. Golmon.\r\nHey if you win now you\'ll get a cheesy basic ending. In fact a third of the universe will die! Nice going! But seriously this level is pretty hectic but Golmon himself isn\'t all that hard. You\'ll want to treat it like any other level removing blue, then green, then red. Also if you can grab the purple hearts for 500 health each. IF GOLMON IS GETTING CLOSE SWITCH TO RED. His attack deals TWENTY FIVE DAMAGE making it more powerful than anything else in the game and you will surely die to that shit. If you kill any surviving enemies will stop but it\'s best to only leave red so when fighting Golmon you don\'t DIE.\r\n\r\nLevel 26B: Dimitri\'s Lair\r\nDimitri is totally Russian. His name would be pretty fitting for green but oh well.\r\nThis would be a cheesy basic ending where a third of the universe dies! Good job! This level isn\'t as bad and Dimitri can be pretty easy to defeat. He can align with you and damage you by RUNNING BEYOND THE SPEED OF LIGHT. Of course you can damage him this way too.\r\n\r\nLevel 26C: Enerjak\'s Lair\r\nI\'m not kidding when I say the name Enerjak was from some crazy villan Knuckles had to beat up in those old Sonic the Hedgehog comics. He\'s by far the worst of the demigods. How the fuck did you manage to kill more red and blue than green? Looking at the totals you\'d have 1280 gems if you killed every enemy in the game. Anyways first off switch to a green aura. Right away he CLEARS YOUR AURA. He runs away from you if you have a green aura and runs toward you otherwise. As soon as you hit him he runs away, clears your aura, and charges. You\'ll lose lots of health on this fucker. But at least you only had to fight him alone.\r\n\r\nLevel 26D: Oxygoth\'s Lair\r\nOxygotholodes was the best Fire Wyrm name in ADOM ever so I gave it to the karmic demigod.\r\nYou got the standard \"hooray\" ending. Nobody dies! Alas you\'ll have to fight all the other demigods at once. So look at the previous sections for an idea of what to expect. It\'s best to beat them level 4 enemies, Blue, Red, Green. If green gets close switch to green and he\'ll run off again. Once you kill all of them (enemies will remain) it\'s time to fight Oxygoth himself. He acts like a level 4 everything hunting you down, charging, dealing heavy damage and his aura changes. Either the boulder or solid towards the top of the level is like changing color so you know his aura. Oxygoth gives you some cryptic hints about getting a better ending by mentioning he was under another being\'s control and that _NOTHING_ defeats karmics with ease. Hint hint kill EVERY ENEMY IN ALL 25 LEVELS to be able to get the 2 fucking horrible endings and the one fucking awesome best ending.\r\n\r\nLevel 26E: Null\'s Lair\r\nI have nothing interesting to say about Null\'s name other than I love it and think it is such a fitting name and I love it again. Null is all HEY FAG YOU CAN\'T KILL ME, I DON\'T HAVE AN AURA. GO THROUGH THE PASSAGE AND _SURRENDER_. Well you can get the WORST ENDING IN THE GAME if you do that. But you want something better I\'m sure. Run up to the fucker and hit him five times. Pay attention to your score/gems/torches while you do that. After the 5th hit he gets pissed and decides to kill you dead. What you\'ll want to do if get rid of an aura in him and he\'ll change his color to red or blue or green. He can then be killed like a normal enemy. This gets you the other shitty ending where everybody\'s dead but you and Oxygoth and you just chill for eternity. You also learn ?+arcade on the main menu unlocks Auracade mode.\r\n\r\nBut wait.\r\n\r\nYou wanted the _GOOD_ ending?\r\n\r\nOh come on now you slaughetered 3 auras I think it\'s a little late for that.\r\n\r\nFine.\r\n\r\nWhile kicking Null\'s ass and making him have an aura KEEP ON DEPOSITING until you have no aura left to rape his soul with. You\'ll teleport to the true final level.\r\n\r\nLevel 27: Karmic Null\r\nNull\'s like WHAT DID YOU DO? :( and you\'re like SORRY. and he\'s like NO IT\'S KILL I CAN STILL KILL YOU. So you fight. This time you\'ll want to attack him with any aura until the * for the near dead demigods becomes a big * thing. Then you win. You saved the universe and are the Ultimate Karmic God which is cool. You also unlock the warp zone and are invited to face the original Oxygoth who is PUNK AS FUCK and is way too fucking hard with ?+warp on the menu.','','2006-08-30',1,'text',1,NULL,'',''),(10,'ZZT Clichés','Unknown','Misc','This was a sort of a ripoff of Cosmo Canyon\'s RPG Cliches page, made by myself all the way back in 1998, if memory serves me correctly.

My programming for that one was warped.\r\n\r\nI use passwords to prevent people from cheating in my games.  I know the\r\ntemptation to look in the programming and figure out what to do next.  In\r\naction games, it\'s not important, but I make adventure games where the\r\nchallenge is figuring out what to do.  Cheating ruins the fun of figuring it\r\nout yourself.  It hides \"secrets\" in the game, not programming \"secrets\"\r\n\r\nI wouldn\'t care if Bhirsh edited my game, but I\'d be pissed if he ruined it\r\nand uploaded it on AOL.\r\n\r\n\\\\//\r\n ||Subj:  Re:PASSWORDS\r\nDate:  96-03-02 15:34:28 EDT\r\nFrom:  E Creator2      \r\n\r\nYeah.

It\'s on the mailing list and on most of the boards.  I have nothing\r\nenlightening to say on the subject.  ZZTOmega isn\'t a newbie.  No-one is a\r\nnewbie.  They don\'t exist.  Beginners exist.  People who haven\'t published a\r\ngame exist.  Yellow border programmers exist.  BHirsh clones exist.  There is\r\nno such thing as a newbie.\r\n\r\nOh, and this \"Oh yeah, I bet you my game is better than yours\" thing is\r\nstupid.  Kinda funny how when someone\'s games are criticized, they attack the\r\nother person\'s.  I\'ve never played any of ZZTOMEGA\'s, but I\'ve played of few\r\nof Majjsoft\'s, which ranged from crumby to above average.  My games are NOT\r\nbetter than yours.  Humble me.  Gnat.  Gnu.  Gnarled.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to my CotA update post on the MZX board.  NOW!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nYour Mama is so fat, she~~~~~~~~AXOLOTL LOL :|=  ######\r\n\r\n\r\n\\\\//\r\n ||Subj:  Ha!

At least ZPower/ZZTurbo tried\r\nto spice \'em up by adding              liddle messages and #zaps.\r\n          What is this fascination with awards of some sort?  First,\r\ntrophies, now, medals!  I mean,              medal merit shouldn\'t be based\r\nsolely on the *s it gets, but on the reviewers own\r\nopinion.  Plus, the medals look cheesy.  Make \'em bigger!

Super locked\r\n(big whoop).\r\nEileen:  Short, but ok.  3 endings.  Interesting strategy for gameplay: get\r\nthe other people to shoot each other.\r\nAttack of the Killer Shrooms:  Lots of fighting in this one.  Sort of like\r\nFred! 2, but with less graphix, storyline.  Ok.\r\nCaptain N:  POINTLESS fighting, w/ minimal plot.  Based on Mega Man and the N\r\nteam.\r\nJail:  Yellow bordered (I think).

A wide variety are available, each with different characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Attributes:</b><br>\r\nMany types of creatures have attributes, such as intelligence, sensitivity, and direction, that can be customized. These attributes affect the movement and behavior of a creature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some creatures have an Intelligence setting. This affects how well the creature will find the player. One with a low intelligence moves largely at random, while an intelligent creature actively follows the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Bears:</b><br>\r\nBears are attracted to the player when the two are close together. Their goal is to directly attack the player. When a bear comes into contact with a Breakable Wall, both disappear. This is important to remember in puzzles that involve these two elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Ruffians:</b><br>\r\nRuffians move sporadically, alternately moving and resting. They will try to catch the player if their intelligence setting is high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Objects:</b><br>\r\nObjects are a versatile kind of creature and can be customized using the ZZT-OOP programming language. When placing an Object on the board, you may pick any character to represent it. Then, you may enter commands to control the creature during game play.\r\nif you want to modify the program of an already-existing Object, position the cursor above it and press [ENTER].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Slime:</b><br>\r\nA single Slime will spread out by replicating itself until an entire region is filled. Slime only oozes through empty space. As slime spreads out, it leaves a trail of breakable walls. The player can stop the slime by touching it; the only threat it poses is in trapping the player. Some slimes spread quicker than others, so watch out if you come into contact with them!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Sharks:</b><br>\r\nSharks travel through water and hurt the player if he is adjacent to their position in the water. They are not harmed by bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Spinning guns:</b><br>\r\nSpinning guns rotate and shoot in random directions. By placing walls on various sides of a gun, it can be aimed in any desired direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Pushers:</b><br>\r\nPushers move slowly in a given direction, pushing Boulders, Sliders, Keys, and other items ahead of them. They can move the player, but they do not pose a direct threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Lions:</b><br>\r\nLions move quickly about the board, attracted to the player according to their intelligence. Lions cannot shoot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Tigers:</b><br>\r\nTigers move toward the player and shoot bullets. These bullets are harmful only to the player; Tigers cannot kill other Creatures with their bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Centipedes:</b><br>\r\nThese are the most interesting type of creature, because they can contain many different parts linked together. A Centipede consists of a Head and several body Segments. The Head decides where to move, and the body follows behind. To place a Centipede on the board, first place the Head, then put Body segments along side in a line. All parts must be in contact. When a Centipede is shot, it will break up into two smaller centipedes, which move independently.</p>','','2010-08-09',1,'html',3,NULL,'',''),(17,'ZZT Online Help','Tim Sweeney','Help','<p>Terrains are the most important part of any ZZT board because they form the foundation upon which the games action is based. Walls, Boulders, Forest, and other terrains can be arranged to form puzzles, mazes, and scenery. Each type of terrain has unique properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Water:</b><br>\r\nNeither players nor creatures can travel through water, but bullets pass freely over it. The player must traverse AROUND water, taking care to avoid bullets passing over it. Sharks are the only kind of creature that can travel through water, but they can not move through land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Forest:</b><br>\r\nThe player can move through forest, clearing a path behind him. Creatures cannot move through forest, but they readily follow the player through cleared paths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Solid and Normal Walls:</b><br>\r\nThese walls form a barrier that is always impenetrable. Nobody walks through walls. Period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Breakable Walls:</b><br>\r\nThese walls also block the player and all creatures, but they can be destroyed. When a breakable wall is shot with a bullet, one piece of the wall disappears. Also, when a bomb explodes, all breakable walls in the vicinity of the bomb are destroyed. Bears can also destroy walls by running into them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Boulders:</b><br>\r\nBoulders are solid objects that can be pushed around by the player. By combining boulders, pushers, walls, and other objects, a variety of challenging thought puzzles can be created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Sliders:</b><br>\r\nSliders are similar to boulders, but they are confined to move in a line. A slider looks like a line with two arrows at opposite ends, and can only move in the direction of the arrows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Fake Walls:</b><br>\r\nFake walls look exactly like normal walls, but have no effect on the player. The player can walk over fake walls just as if they were empty space. Fake walls are meant for creating secret passages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Invisible Walls:</b><br>\r\nInvisible walls look like empty space to the player, but they prevent the player from moving over them. When the player touches an invisible wall, it suddenly appears as a normal wall. Creatures can not pass through invisible walls, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Blinking Walls:</b><br>\r\nA blinking wall placed on the board emits a ray pointing in a specified direction. This ray blinks on and off at a constant rate, which forms a barrier that is difficult for the player to cross. When created, each blinking wall must be assigned a starting time and a duration. By creating a line of walls with the same duration but varying start times, a moving wave appears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Transporter:</b><br>\r\nWhen the player enters a transporter, he is magically moved to another area of the board. Each transporter points in a given direction, and the player can only enter the transporter from behind. He is then moved along a line, in the direction of the transporter, to the nearest transporter that points in the opposite direction.</p>','','2010-08-09',1,'html',4,NULL,'',''),(18,'ZZT Online Help','Tim Sweeney','Help','The following items are available:\r\n\r\n<p><b>Ammunition:</b><br>\r\nWhen the player touches a unit of ammo, he receives five bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Torches:</b><br>\r\nA Torch gives visibility in rooms which are dark. The player picks up a torch by touching it, but the torch does not become lit until the player activates it by pressing \"T\". Torches last only a fraction of a minute, and provide limited visibility in rooms that are dark.\r\nTo make a room dark, press \"I\" for the Board Information Menu and select the \"Room is dark\" option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Gems:</b><br>\r\nGems are bonus points for a player. Touching a gem awards the player ten bonus points and one unit of health. By using the ZZT-OOP \"GIVE\" and \"TAKE\" commands, you can create objects that trade supplies or just about anything in exchange for gems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Keys:</b><br>\r\nKeys are used to unlock doors. They are colour-coded, and there are seven colors of keys. To unlock a door, the player must possess a key of the same colour. The player cannot hold two keys of the same colour, but he can hold all seven different-collared keys at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Doors:</b><br>\r\nDoors prevent the player from entering a region. To get through a door, the player must be holding a matching key. If he has the matching key, then the door will open and the player will lose possession of the key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Scrolls:</b><br>\r\nScrolls contain text messages, such as hints, dialog, and puzzles. When the player touches a scroll, the message appears for the player to read. If the scroll contains only one line of text, the message will be flashed on the bottom of the screen. Otherwise, a window will pop up and the player may browse through the text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Passages:</b><br>\r\nA passage is a gateway to another room. When you place a passage on the board, you must specify which room is through the passage. Whenever the player touches a passage, he is transported to a new room. The player will be placed in the new room in a position defined by two distinct cases: if there is a matching passage in the new room, the player will enter the destination room through it; otherwise, the player will be arrive in the destination board on the spot where he appears in the board editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Duplicators:</b><br>\r\nA duplicator slowly replicates an object placed next to it. First, put a creature somewhere on the board. Next, place a duplicator adjacent to it, and specify the direction pointing to the creature. Finally, put walls around the original creature so that it remains next to the duplicator. Duplicators can be used to fill up a board with creatures as a game progresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Bombs:</b><br>\r\nThe player activates a bomb by touching it. The bomb begins counting down from 9, exploding when it reaches 1. While a bomb is ticking, the player can move it around by pushing it. When a bomb explodes, it will zap all Creatures and Breakable Walls in close proximity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Energizers:</b><br>\r\nTouching an energizer gives the player a brief taste of invincibility. During this time, the player changes colors and is free to come into contact with normally harmful creatures, destroying them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Conveyors:</b><br>\r\nConveyors cause adjacent objects to move. Both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating conveyors exist. By placing several conveyors together, objects can be made to circulate in nearly any desired pattern.</p>\r\n','','2010-08-09',1,'html',5,NULL,'',''),(19,'ZZT Online Help','Tim Sweeney','Help','<p>The best way to learn something is to jump right in.

The primary difference between ZZT-OOP and conventional languages such as BASIC is the use of messages. The following two objects illustrate a more intense use of messages:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the first object:</p>\r\n<table class=\"oop\">\r\n    <tr><td>@Lefty</td><td>This object\'s name.</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>/e/e/e/e</td><td>Move east four times...</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>/w/w/w/w</td><td>...then west four times.</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>#send Righty:Do</td><td>Sends the \"DO\" message to the Object named Righty.</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>#end</td><td>Halts.</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the other object:</p>\r\n<table class=\"oop\">\r\n    <tr><td>@Righty</td><td>This other object\'s name.</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>#end</td><td>Stops running; in this case, it waits for another meesage or command to continue.</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>:Do</td><td>The \"DO\" label.</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>/w/w/w/w</td><td>Move west four times..</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>/e/e/e/e</td><td>..then east four times.</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>#send Lefty:restart</td><td>Tells our counterpart to restart.</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td>#end</td><td>Done for now.</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>These two objects form a feedback loop. When the game starts, Lefty will move then send a message to Righty. This causes Righty to move and then tell Lefty to restart.

The graphics, whilst dated, are obviously ahead of its time for 1991, incorporating primitive shading and chaotic blotches of colour that set the scene quite well. Unlike other games that came out during, or even long after, Ezanya is highly interactive. Almost every object on the board is interactive. It\'s done well too. There are menus to choose from, things that give different messages at different times, and even some good royal music that plays when you talk to the king. Another notable feature of the game is music that doesn\'t tax the ears. Every small detail seems to warm up the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all of this the writing has to be good, and it is. Besides the fact that Daggert can use proper grammar, he also has the ability to give some very good descriptions of what is going on. The dialogue is done well and isn\'t tedious or boring. This makes for a game that focuses on trying to create an atmosphere rather than flat-out game play. Still Ezanya doesn\'t falter there either. Very little separates the first level of the caves from you typical dungeon crawl to-day. There are pre-programmed monsters, which is excusable, but there are also a supple amount of programmed dwarves and dragons for you to fight, especially as you progress, the monster/object ratio seems to favour the objects more and more which allows the game to become more interesting by keeping things fresh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game, is not flawless however, the building of the levels seemed to lack proper testing as there were many times (Dwarven Outpost) where I had run out of ammo with very little health and had to hurry back to the pub to get some more. I suppose I did run a little haphazardly though a lot of it but only had to cheat only three times. Once for a slider puzzle(not a good one either) and twice for health. Overall this game is a step above the other games of 1991 and even now. If you\'re going to play only one 1991 game from ZZT, avoid Town and play Ezanya.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"file-screen c col\"><img src=\"/assets/images/featured/ezanya2-2.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"file-screen c col\"><img src=\"/assets/images/featured/ezanya3-2.gif\"></div>','','2016-04-05',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(24,'Featured Game: Burglar!','Commodore','Featured Game','Burglar! is a game that is fun from the first board to the last. You play as Luke Steel, an aspiring burglar looking for a good time. Baglarr and Sons is the organisation that supports your criminal activities and they assign you places to rob and items to steal. Each robbery requires figuring out different ways of breaking in and avoiding detection. The amount of liberties you have in this game is what makes the gameplay really fun. First you must select three items from a collection of tools for use in the robbery. Some tools are required, some only allow you to steal more from the place you are robbing. Figuring out the best combination of items to maximise the amount of goods you can steal is a enjoyable test of perception. During the robbery you can basically grab anything of worth that isn\'t nailed down or too heavy. You also have to prepare for the unexpected, like noisy and restless children. There\'s plenty of tension as you sneak around and work against the forces that try to thwart you. Frantically running around and touching everything while a cleaning lady is slowly getting closer was something that actually got my heart racing. The varity of the missions is good ranging from your casual petty theft to breaking in to the city\'s own police station. Also part of the action is a pickpocket free for all where you try and pinch as many billfolds as possible within a period of time. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe story starts off seeming secondary to the fun of going around robbing places, but later as you begin to get yourself in trouble you uncover the misdeeds of the company\'s very own leader. The character you play handles this in a very singular way, by breaking in to the Boss\'s office. Luke Steel himself as a character is an impulsive one. Picking the pockets of everyone, kneeing the guard in the crotch repeatedly, and generally being a bad-ass who doesn\'t care who he steps on to get to the top. He never doubts why he is stealing or stops to wonder where it will lead him. Getting caught or killed is always on his mind, but he knows that that will not, in the end, be the results of his deeds. On top of the good characterisation and story, the writing and humour is spot on. Numerous references to Drac0 and Knightt combined with humour that everyone can understand makes for a game that is both fresh and familiar. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe graphics in Burglar! are entirely on par with the rest of the game. The street is shown at an impressive 2/3 perspective and the cutscenes are well drawn with plenty of objects used for small details like cigars, cigarettes and drinks. The colours contrast very well and the backgrounds are bright and provide plenty of eyecandy. The mood set by dark scenes and drained expressions makes you feel for your character and makes you want him to succeed though the dark times of his experiences. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBurglar! stands out as one of the best games ZZT has to offer. It\'s fun, original, and addictive. The graphics are detailed and atmospheric. The music needs to be released on CD. The game needs to be downloaded and experienced.

Your quest is to find the Minfannon, a jewel which will enable your society to control the tyrant king\'s mind, and enable Princess Salmonella to ascend to her rightful place on the throne.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOf course, it\'s never that easy, is it? The Minfannon is located in a volcano beyond Dragon Woods, near your hometown of Coaster. So, off you go to buy some magic (ammo), torches, health, and other such like, and begin your quest. Along the way you will meet with such perils as a group of druids performing a sacrifice, a stubborn troll who won\'t allow you to pass his bridge, a vampire named Cracula inspired by Zenith\'s Geography teacher, and ultimately, a dragon guarding the Minfannon itself.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGameplay is based primarily on \"find objects or information, find out what they\'re for, and get new objects or information in the process,\" but there\'s also a little exploration to do, and a few well-programmed shootouts (not to mention a turn-based RPG battle at the end). Effort is put into tried-and-true tricks of the trade (try saying that ten times fast). The jokes in general are funny and the whole game has a very lighthearted atmosphere, in spite of the perils of Lindor\'s quest.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe graphics are cute, as Zenith\'s style is wont to be, and in general are quite aesthetically pleasing. I am particularly impressed by his scenes in nature (which dominate the game) with trees and rivers, and such like. The programming is very sound, though I did encounter one or two small bugs, and the only really annoying ZZT clich? you\'ll find (apart from an entire board of cameos, which is actually really interesting from a historical perspective) is a small one of those darned invisomazes. Well, at \r\nleast it isn\'t a whole board.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere\'s only a couple of noteworthy problems with the game; the music is nothing spectacular, and quite a few of the sound effects are shaky. There\'s also a little bit too much walking around to do, which can become tedious.

The graphics are almost exclusively for playable boards; art boards are only used at the beginning and conclusion of the game, which gives it a very free-flowing feel.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSimple pick-up-an-object-and-find-a-use-for-it gameplay is used; many of the objects\' uses are rather ... illogical, but hey, this is a drug trip we\'re talking about here.

This has the effect of making the writing not only very interesting, but also hilarious. It\'s nothing that JohnWWells might consider spectacular in terms of narrative technique ... but how can one not feel amused when faced with the message, \"you approach a decapitated man, his limbs strewn all over th\'place, a vine tied securely around his neck. he has BLO0D\", or meeting Master Bates, who has suffered the grievous misfortune of \"pulling a boner\"?<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut beyond all the silly jokes,  and references to Harvey Danger and how much he \"rocks ass\", as the game draws to a close another side of the author himself is revealed; one of sadness and emptiness.

This is a tutorial outlining things any aspiring ZZT programmer should avoid. As the name implies, ZZT Syndromes is a parade of those horrible, horrible afflictions common to ZZT games at the, erm, \"less professional\" end of the spectrum. Barjesse obviously believes in the idea of learning through example, so he proceeds to put the player through that which must not be. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe file itself, following the (literally) flashy introduction screen, is split into two parts, characterised by a fork in a path. One road leads the observer to bear witness to Syndromes deemed \"Fatal\" while the other leads to those pertaining to the label \"Goofy\". The difference between these two is a simple one- Fatal Syndromes are those that will, more often than not, cause a player to delete the game out of frustration, while Goofy Syndromes are that which renders a game, while not unplayable, rather annoying to progress through. Yes, you too can witness firsthand the horror of the \"Not Enough Health\" Syndrome! The annoyance of the \"Broken Board Link Syndrome\"! The tedium of the \"Ping-Pong Path Syndrome\" and the downright stupidity of the \"Poor Man With A Big Dog Syndrome\"! All and so much more are contained herein for your personal delection, you lucky kid. Lucky, lucky child. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIf the above seem similar to the stuff from Wong Chung Bang\'s \"ZZT Crime\", that\'s because ZZT Crime is basically Syndromes with a few bits added and changed. Play that as well, there\'s no reason why you shouldn\'t; but I recommend playing this first simply for chronological order (Syndromes was made in 1996 or thereabouts, while Crime is dated c. 2000.). <br><br>\r\n\r\nAll this, and it has a guy who just says \"Hi!\" <br><br>\r\n\r\nAlso recommended; <br><br>\r\n\r\nZZT Crime (Wong Chung Bang) <br>\r\nZZT Help (Matt Williams) <br>\r\nSemi-Cool Things You Can Do With ZZT (Dudeworks) <br>\r\nZZT Encyclopaedia (Chronos30)','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(28,'Featured Game: The Mercenary','Flaming O','Featured Game','ZZT has its limits, to be honest. Yet they games that are considered remarkable are the games that seem to know no limits. Wong Chung Bang\'s The Mercenary are one of these few elite. What sets this game apart from others it that it may be the most re-playable game in the lifespan of ZZT. You may find yourself playing this game a dozen times, each time with a different path. You start out your journey placed with a pivotal decision.  You must decide from three items are placed before you: a rope, a gauntlet, and a lockpick. Your choice on which of the three \"relics\", as they are called in the game, you take with you molds the quest ahead of you. To explore new areas, rocks must be crushed, crevasses must be crossed, and locked doors must be opened. All of those tasks require a certain item complete the action, yet it depends on which one you have that determines your continuing journey. But don\'t fret over this early decision; you will be able to acess the other two relics, along with a bonus one, after beating the game\'s unique and challenging bosses.   <br><br>\r\n\r\nYet there\'s much more to this quest than passing barriers. You confront a variety of enemies, such as statues, mummies, and fireballs, all of which are killed in a specific way. A system of upgrading weapons from touch attack swords to long range attack guns make this possible. These upgrades, along with the essential health, ammunition, and torches to light the way, can be puchaced with gems found throughout the game.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWong Chung\'s genius doesn\'t end there. He provides the player with a system of experience, which is obtained through killing enemies and discovering items. This system sets a limit on the number of heath, torches, and ammo you can hold, adding more challenge to the game and an rpg-ish feel.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe game is one of few first-rate ZZT games that does without a developing plot. Yet it need not have one, for it is a game of exploration, not narration.  His bright colored graphics also set proper mood for the contrasting enviroments you will traverse through.

Nobody really took any notice of it. It was a demo amongst hundereds of demos, and nobody really knew much about its author, Mr. J.W. Wells, other than that he liked to frequent the forums with random stuff about operas and sorcery that seemed more out of place to your average preteen ZZTer than craNKGod in a sperm bank. I did manage to find the time to play it though, and I\'m glad I did. It didn\'t look all that special, but the gameplay and writing was far above my personal expectations of a modern ZZT game - which are already quite high - and two thoughts entered my head. The first was that the game had the potential to be brilliant, and the second that the game would never ever be finished. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen news came that Funk [<a href=\"http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/?p=database&title=Indiana+Jones+and+the+Lost+Crusaders\">\"Indiana Jones and the Lost Crusaders\"</a>] was going to be doing the art for ESP, it only added to my pessimism. Not because Funk wasn\'t very good at art - far from it - but because the game now had a label that had doomed all previous games under it to failure. A genre that even IF couldn\'t pull off to any great effect back when it had some of the best ZZTers in the world in its name. It was now a \'joint\' project. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen news came that the second disc had corrupted and that Funk had given up, I stopped following ESP. I thought it would have been futile to continue it. Wells hadn\'t given up, however; some time later, I heard that Nadir [<a href=\"http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/?p=database&title=Dragon+Woods\">\"Dragon Woods\"</a>, <a href=\"http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/?p=database&title=Dragon+Woods\">\"Code Red:SE\"</a>] and Rob_P [<a href=\"http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/?p=database&title=\"Interstellar+Police:+Escape from Stal\' Prison\">\"Interstellar Police: Escape from Stal\' Prison\"</a>] were added as replacements, and the game was finally released at the end of March, 2003.[1] I deliberately stayed away from beta testing because I wanted to enjoy the game in its completeness, and write a fair and unbiased review. I had very high expectations of a game with such big names behind it, despite the actual game being structured and written by a relative newcomer.  Not only did ESP meet those expectations, but it surpassed them in almost every way. <br><br>\r\n\r\nESP is about a bunch of, well, Evil Sorcerers, who plan to take over government by using hypnosis to sway public opinion. It\'s a bit more deep than that, really, and it\'s not all boring political satire or geek RPG magic rubbish either. In fact, it\'s nothing like that at all. The plot is quite long and keeps the game interesting, and needs to be played to be fully experienced. \r\n\r\n<u>Gameplay:</u> <br>\r\nFirst things first.  Size.  Now some people might fool you into believing that size isn\'t everything, and in some cases that is true, but not in ZZT. I\'ve rarely played a game over 300kb that was crap, and ESP is almost three times that size. Luckily the size is backed up by quality, as you can tell by the number of boards per file. To explain, the game is four files, but the number of boards in each file is pretty small, about the number you would expect in a one or two file game. That doesn\'t make the game short by any means; it took me three hours to play through the entire thing [2]. It just shows that so many flags were set and so much code written in such a small space that wells needed to make more worlds simply to avoid the dreaded runtime errors (Which you may still get if you run this game in windows on an old computer). If you\'re tired of 30kb ZZT games with no real meaning, this is the game for you. The /text file/ is bigger than a third of the ZZT games on this archive. This alone speaks volumes. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe game itself is split into six chapters, though only five are playable in one game. The end chapter is chosen by the player (I\'ll get to that soon enough). One of the most delightful things about ESP is that Wells picks up on a fundamental thing a lot of people tend to miss when playing games of this size - there are many audiences to cater to. There are three types of people that will play ESP. Firstly, the people like me, who are pretty bad at action sequences and find them somewhat dull. We prefer puzzles over the shift key. Then there are people who like action and puzzles to clear their mind, and give him a bit of a distraction. Finally there are the people who will just play the game for action, and lay smackdown to the enter key whenever they even smell a dialogue box. Luckily, ESP caters for the first two examples. Granted, it does little to appease the last example, but this type of gamer would be better of playing mindless action games like Arena. <br><br>\r\n\r\nSo how do you cater for both action kids and adventure gamers? Simple! You ask them. When you get to the first action scene in the game (I won\'t ruin anything), you are given the option to cancel the time limit, kill the enemies, get more health, or go it alone. Unfortunately for people like me, you can\'t skip it completely, and you can still die, but action sequences do tend to become easier when the game kills all the bad guys for you. The game even becomes non-linear for a little while, a rarity for adventure games, when you choose between action and adventure for a whole chapter. The outcome of these chapters doesn\'t affect the #endgame though, which is mildly disappointing. There\'s no Code Red multiple endings here, despite the game being set up perfectly for it. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile this alone is reason enough for me to breathe a sigh of relief that I don\'t have to sit through the engines [3] (nice and original and bug free as they are, some of us just /don\'t like them/) it would have been nice if the game had been a little more subtle about gameplay choices. While help is welcome on single boards, the choice at the end of chapter 4 was a little to black and white for me. I think Wells could have approached it with a bit more style and avoided interrupting the flow of the game. Perhaps there could have been a choice driven conversation, and choices picked determined if they player wanted to fight or use puzzles. Or perhaps, like Lucasgames\' \"Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis\" point-and-click adventure, have boards where you can solve puzzles by smashing things up or thinking things through. A minor gripe, but still something that seems a little unprofessional compared to the rest of the game. At least this way you know for certain what path you\'ll take, though. <br><br>\r\n\r\nChoice and non-linearity aside, I haven\'t actually answered the question you all came hear to find out about. \'What\'s the bloody game like?\' You could have downloaded it and been half way through the first chapter by now, but you\'re obviously either Wells or one of the artists looking at what I\'ve said about your game. Or you value my opinion, misguided fools. Anyway, the game is mostly a mix of dialogue & cut scenes and inventory-based puzzle solving. Both are very enjoyable and reasonably well balanced. One more Gameplay chapter would have been nice, just to space out the game a little, as the ending seems to hit you like knightt on a catapult. You play two agents during the game, Cleatle, a \'concerned\' scientist, and Burns, a member of the \r\nparty who happens to be a Sunday school teacher and a ex secret service agent. Cleatle\'s missions are geared towards puzzle solving. None of his missions contain engines or action sequences - Apart from a rather original and easy \'RPG\' engine - and only a few time limits. Burns\' missions are geared towards action, and choosing her chapter at the end will allow you to play the majority of action boards in ESP.  She also has more engines and time limits. <br><br>\r\n\r\nInventory gaming is simple, and those who have never played an inventory game before will know what to do straight away.  For those that haven\'t, Wells explains, reminding users to unset any flags they set, as the game uses quite a few of them each file. For this reason, editing probably isn\'t a good idea either. Inventory gaming basically involves picking things up and using them with other things/people to achieve your goal. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of this section of the game is a little lacking.  I\'m pretty bad at adventure games but I only had to look at the help file once - to solve a maths puzzle that I knew I wouldn\'t understand. The inclusion of a very detailed help file that will only give you the help you need was a very good idea, and it saved me from getting very annoyed with the game. Some games have links to websites or authors\' emails, but this way as long as I have the game, I have the help file, too. It makes it easier to abuse, however, and that will ruin the game entirely. It\'s hardly Wells\' fault if people can\'t control themselves, though. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe games puzzles are logical and straightforward; there are no ridiculous scenarios like using a set of keys on parrots or anything insane like that - just normal puzzles that make sense. On a whole, this makes the game easier than more outlandish inventory games like p0p, but also more likeable and less frustrating as well. You CAN die in the inventory parts of the game, normally a fatal gameplay design for adventure games, but it\'s very hard to do.  You only die for doing very stupid things that will obviously kill you. It\'s advisable to save anytime you are going to try something you aren\'t certain will work. This is basic good advice for any ZZT game, and, luckily, whenever there is a higher-than-normal chance of you dying, Wells warns you beforehand to save. There are a few impromptu deaths here, and you\'ll normally have to at least press your way through dialogue you\'ve read to get back to the point you died, even if you save when Wells tell you to. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe action sequences are more difficult, even without resorting to \'real\' RPG battles or super difficult bosses. The enemies fire fast and move fast and your health is never super high, so you have to be on your guard if you\'re going to play through all of Burns\' missions without help from the game. I prefer her engines to the actual action sequences, which, while great, don\'t seem to keep up with the quality of the rest of the game. Her engines range from quite difficult to very easy. One of her engines isn\'t skippable, but it\'s so easy that you\'ll barely notice anyway.  I still would have liked the option, though. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe only real problem I have with the gameplay itself is that there wasn\'t enough conversation. While there was plenty of dialogue in itself, there wasn\'t enough \'user lead\' conversations. Many adventures use question asking interfaces on people to find clues or mainly just to add to the game and find out more about people. It would have been nice if I could have said more than what the game wanted me to say. Cleatle doesn\'t seem like the kind of person to get straight to the point about things, and it would have fleshed the game out so much more. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<u>Plot and Writing:</u><br>\r\nFor a game with so much of this, it\'s only fair to give it it\'s own section. There is a lot of dialogue in ESP, and many cut scenes, but they are well worth reading and viewing. The plot is at least half the enjoyment of the game. The plot itself is a little average, but the writing is brilliant. For the first time since Rhygar, I\'ve felt that the characters are more than just smilies and that they actually have a reason to care about them.[4]. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe annoying thing about writing reviews is that I can\'t really tell you much about the way the plot works except that it\'s \'very good.\' It\'s varied, interesting, and funny in most parts. It\'s a good vehicle to carry the gameplay. You never feel like you are doing the same thing twice. It\'s all there if you want to read it, its accessible and straightforward - chapter, cut scene, chapter, cut scene. No suprises there, which is a little unfortunate; the structure of the game is a bit dull. I also get the feeling in parts that Wells tried to dumb himself down a little, adding in occasions notes that people should read everything, when he really shouldn\'t have bothered. If people don\'t read it, and they die, they should go play Town of ZZT or something that doesn\'t have so much effort and emphasis put into the writing. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe only thing I didn\'t like about the game was the ending, which seemed a little immature for Wells, It felt like AKWARE had taken over Wells\' mind. I much preferred the ending he never wrote into the game that\'s scripted in the text file. I may sound pretentious here, but I thought that this ending seemed to fit in more with the rest of the game. Again, I won\'t spoil things, and you\'ll have to make up your own mind about that. I\'m aware that many people, me included, would be hesitant about the quality of a game made by someone who NEVER shuts up about Guilbert and that other guy, and opera, and thinks top hats are the height of fashion. So to warn you, the game does have some elements of that. Most, luckily are in the form of in jokes not crucial to the games comedy factor. There are a few things you wont understand or care about, if you aren\'t either clued up on G&S, understand Latin or English, the later I\'m sure due to Funk adding random English in-jokes (Brass Eye, Eh?) into the games\' files. <br><br>\r\n\r\nSome other things, such as the chair poems, seem a little out of place in ZZT and don\'t really fit the flow of the game. Of course, none of this stops the game from being one of the best games ever created; it just means you might have a few occasions where you think, \'What the..?\'. Luckily, it seems Wells doesn\'t take himself too seriously, an obvious mistake when making a comic adventure game. The very end board is brilliant proof of this. Don\'t think you need to be cultured to like this game. Hell, I love it, and I\'m listening to Avril Lavigne while I write this. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe funniest moments in the game aren\'t usually in the actual big segments of dialogue, though; it\'s too set up and cardboard to be brilliant humor, but there are some real rimshot moments in there. The horse thing and some of the \'aside\' moments when people are talking are just a little too corny for me. Thank God that Wells didn\'t give up and start the whole arguing with the narrator. Chickenwire, this is not. The laugh out loud (or at least snigger) bits in the game come in the form of being a fool. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBecause of the incredible attention to detail, it\'s great running around and trying stuff that you know won\'t work just to see what the game says about it. It\'s real Lucasarts humour, here. Most of them - but not all - can be found in the text file, but play around and try everything; you really can\'t rush around if you want to get the most out of this game. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAll the funniest humour isn\'t the humour that the dialogue boxes make you read. Overall, the writing is some of the best in ZZT. Though it can resort to being cheap and a little cringe-worthy, Wells has always tried a little to hard to be a Victorian Englishman in my book, and even in games comes off a little elitist, but this is only in very few cases that can easily be shrugged off compared to the writing as a whole. There\'s so much of it, though I think there should have been even more, especially in game. It all seems very formulaic. It would have been nice to go \'off the rails\' a bit and talk to things and see things that don\'t have anything to do with the game. Red herrings not only make the game more fun, but make it harder as well. Flags permitting, of course. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<u>Graphics and Sound:</u>\r\nThe graphics are where Wells steps out of the arena, and Funk, Nadir, and Rob_P take his place. The first world, drawn by Funk, has some of the best \'People art\', with the characters looking funny but realistic, well-shaded, and with good proportion - everything you would expect from Funk, had you played one of his ZZTV channels in the past, and everything you would expect from a game of this style. His game boards aren\'t quite as inspiring, a bit ugly in places with too little shading, though there are some really nice boards, such as the top-down view of the alleyway in Chapter One and the Scope view on Brickles in Chapter Two. He does tend to make the sorcerers looks a little overweight, though. <br><br>\r\n\r\nNadir does a much better job of game boards, though I was expecting more of a style change than what I saw. The cut scenes were obviously different, but the game boards generally stayed the same, though a little more detailed than Funk\'s. However, Nadir has the tendency to get a little overexcited, and he put a few too many objects and colors than most human eyes can cope with. The overhead screen on Chapter Four is a little hard to navigate round, though generally nice to look at, even if you can\'t always tell what it is. Having worked with Rob_P, his style for disc three was a little more apparent than the others. There\'s little empty space that isn\'t taken up by random blocks, and, unlike Funk\'s rooms, his rooms don\'t take up the whole board - they only use the space they need. His character art is nice, especially with the picture of Burn\'s and Octinar looking quite drac0-ish. It has a very \'classic-IF\' flavour to it. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnyone thinking that there will be huge style changes will be mistaken. The only really noticeable ones are from disc three to disc four, where Rob\'s dark style is replaced with Nadir\'s semi-trippy board stylings once again. Nadir\'s work is just brighter, and as he replaced Kracken to do the 4th file as well as the 2nd, the game seems to go from light to dark and then light again, which is more noticeable than the other changes. Still, most graphical changes are only noticeable if you are really looking, and if you already know the other artists quite well, or if you are being pedantic. Like me. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe good thing about ESP is that you won\'t really be looking at the art because the game doesn\'t <i>need</i> eye candy to pull you in. It helps it a lot, and the game would have been far less fun without the help of the artists, but ESP is the kind of game where you only really notice the art when looking back at it. You\'re too busy focusing on the task at hand than taking in how pretty the shading is. All three artists have done an amazing job here though, both with graphics and with design. They really add another dimension to the game - one that should not be ignored. <br><br>\r\n\r\nSound is never something I consider very highly in a ZZT game; anything less than a MIDI file isn\'t enough to be immersive. I sat through it, though. It\'s used to a very original effect in Chapter Two, with the player having to get into a hall before the music ends (there is good reason for this). Wells went and wrote lyrics for the songs as well. Not really my thing, but a nice touch. I still would have preferred to keep the music off though. It adds very little to the game. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<u>Overall:</u>\r\nHad ESP been released in the late nineties, when many people were screaming about Teen Priest, Gem Hunter and, for some unknown reason, SPRG, it wouldn\'t have got the attention it has now. But now not only is it a brilliant game that I believe surpasses all of the games mentioned above, it also serves as a beacon to all ZZTers. It\'s as if Wells has stood looking over everyone who plays modern ZZT games and is shouting, \'Look what you can do with a little effort!\' Though he\'d probably more likely start blithering on about office chairs and hats, mind you. Nevertheless, I\'d far prefer 4 or 5 ESP-quality games a year than 100 or 200 piles of crap that get submitted. I\'d like to see Wells iron out the problems that I\'ve mentioned here and take a few weeks to make a sort of \'Version 1.1.\' If he added one more chapter, it would make the game seem a lot more balanced and perhaps make the ending seem a little less sudden. I\'d love it to incorporate the ending in the text file as well, to make the game really non-linear with multiple endings, but we can\'t have everything. If we did, though, I\'d certainly rate this game the joint best game I\'ve ever played. <br><br>\r\n\r\nESP is a game that has been written from the heart, with everyone involved pouring everything they have into its creation. For Wells, it will be his only ZZT game, for Funk and the rest of the artists, probably the last non-ZZTV art they will ever draw (though don\'t hold me to that). You can see every board was planned, designed and drawn exactly the way it was intended, and the beta testing is simply amazing - Terryn\'s review mentioned only two typing errors in the entire game; I only found one. It\'s a very polished game that wasn\'t rushed or made to please anyone but the people that worked on it, and it\'s easily one of the best ZZT games ever made. Don\'t let this go unplayed; it\'s too good to be ignored. They just don\'t make them like this anymore. <br><br>\r\n\r\nESP is for:<br> \r\n+ Adventure gamers who enjoy any point-and click-adventures and games like <a href=\"http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/?p=database&title=Kudzu\">\"Kudzu\"</a> and <a href=\"http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/?p=database&title=p0p\">\"p0p.\"</a><br>\r\n+ People who like games to be varied, but also enjoy the choice of whether or not to do sequences they may find difficult. <br>\r\n+ Anyone with a good sense of humour. <br>\r\n+ People who like Inventory games but usually find them too difficult or aimless to play. <br><br>\r\n\r\nESP is not for: <br>\r\n+ People who don\'t want to spend at least 90 minutes playing a ZZT game. <br>\r\n+ People who can\'t stand having to read huge amounts of text and dialogue boxes. <br>\r\n+ Those who want non-stop action and RPG battles. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>96%</b> - The second highest score I\'ve ever given a ZZT game! <br><br>\r\n\r\n[1] You can read the rest of the games story (And a LOT more) in the games text file. <br>\r\n[2] Though bear in mind that I\'m Fishfood, and I am bad at everything, including inventory games.

But this is no ordinary restaurant; it\'s BJ\'s Fast Food Restaurant, the very first fast food ever. Set in the 50\'s, Burger Joint captures the atmosphere of the era without even leaving the restaurant. The music, some taken from Grease, some from 50\'s bands, is scattered all throughout the game and succeeds in signaling events, creating a mood, and by playing music for different characters; it further develops the characters and story. There\'s no lack of music, either. Madguy has been known for good music over his career. and this game may well be the capstone. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBurger Joint takes place entirely within the restaurant. Even the title screen is a picture of the restaurant. Gameplay varies, involving doing things asked of you, which is not that hard, or improvising ways of solving problems that occur either to the people or the machines of the restaurant. The problems themselves merely involve touching objects, but the relationship objects have to each other and patrons of the restaurant must be remembered in order to solve a particular puzzle. Actions must also be performed within a certain time limit, such as cleaning the place up before the first customer arrives. <br><br>\r\n\r\nGraphics are hard to judge with only one scene to work with, but for this game, all you need in terms of graphics are visuals that aren\'t ugly and objects that can easily be identified. The colours chosen work well, and nothing is visually distracting, which means you can concentrate on having fun. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe writing is one of the game\'s strongest points. The characters are well developed and the humour draws not from random jokes, but character driven narrative. Interactions between strong figures in the story allow for jokes that don\'t seem \"out of the blue\". The actual story is secondary to the way the characters interact. Sure there is a beginning, a climax, and a conclusion, but what\'s more important is that your character survived the day. When you feel like you want a little smiling ASCII character to succeed in life you\'re either a loser, or you\'re playing a really good game. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhilst your time while playing the game is sometimes spent frantically touching everything possible, the humour, story, and your curiosity to see what will happen next, will make you play this game from beginning to end. As far as replay value goes, the humour is the only thing that would make you come back to it; still, it\'s one of those games you download and add to your permanent collection.','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(31,'Featured Game: Kudzu 2.1','Nadir','Featured Game','An odd one to review, this. As the observant among you may have noticed, there\'s two versions of Kudzu available on z2. Despite their terming as v1 and v2, they\'re not sequels- but the second offers more closure as to the plot behind what seems, at first, to be a bold but confusing mixture of images and often intriguing words. The first version was made by Cly5m shortly before a two-year long visit to Estonia in 1998 (missionary work, if I recall correctly), and the second was made shortly after his return; after which he wandered off somewhere or other. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut what of the plot, I hear you cry! Well, it would be a disservice to give too much away as half the fun is finding out. After a parachute jump, you land off-course atop a mysterious red building. You don\'t know where you are, but you reason that there must be a telephone somewhere around, so you go in search of one, only to find the building and its environs inhabited by living water, possessed vases and battling holograms; and then there\'s the small matter of that rampart structure made out of multicoloured stone and what look to be intestines... <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe graphics in this game are, in my opinion, its selling point. Or it would be if this stuff were to be actually bought and sold with money. Cly5m uses the same bold, geometric graphic and colour technique used in his previous games (Crunchy and Turmoil), creating a world filled with angular, cuboidal buildings and deceptively simple shading that add to its dreamlike structure and general atmosphere. The gameplay is not that of your typical ZZT game (run, shoot, RPG battle, cinema, shoot, cinema etc.), instead placing emphasis almost entirely upon looking around- what action there is is over quickly, or involves the player torturing small animals (the game allows you to kill or break much of your surroundings). This type of \'touch and observe\' gameplay went on to influence games such as *p0p*, Bizanloo, Edible Vomit and Winter, either directly or no- as did the idea of the imaginary world as a whole. The influence upon future games is important! <br><br>\r\n\r\nDo I recommend it? Most certainly, you lugubrious-eyed ragamuffin, so full of sorrow and innocence! But if you want the full feel to it, you should download both and play the first version through, wait a short while and then play the second one- this will go some way to recalling the sheer \"wtf\" factor of the first time around and its abrupt ending, followed by a full explanation the second time around. <br><br>\r\n\r\nGo forth and play Kudzu, you stupids =( <br><br>\r\n\r\n-- <br><br>\r\n\r\nthis reveiw was writed by nadar doant steal or els','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(32,'Featured Game: Run-On 2.4','Flaming O','Featured Game','With most games today, after playing it long enough, there will be nothing new to extract from it. You\'ll find all the secret items and characters, find the hidden levels, and know where everything is located at. Yet a noteworthy exception is Wil\'s Run-On. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you started the game as an embryo in the womb, you\'d still be playing a different game at the Pearly Gates. Wil accomplishes this almost god-like feat by using complete randomness. And to skip doing an entire section on the beneficial (yet sometimes overrated) replay value, I\'m going to give you number crunchers a little equation: Randomness = Infinite replay value. Terrain is randomly generated as you progress through levels, which means you have to clear forest, shoot breakables, and run to the other side of the screen. It\'s like putting your CD player on random; you know what you\'re going to get, but the order it will come in will play itself out through the progression of the game. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut what\'s the running for? Well, the answer is this: evil. Your character, upon an abrupt revelation, is being pursued by evil and must constantly outrun it by running in specified directions, yet after a length of time, you will be \"pulled\" in the opposite direction, simulating the evil catching up with the player. You have to hustle, for the only alternative is death. Along with evil, you have an array of enemies, either pre-programmed or amusingly original, such as lions, tigers, bears, newbies, a drunk, cactuses, and an insane taxi driver. You have to be quick with your gun to ward off these adversities. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWil also puts the player through a string of contrasting lands and worlds. They range from a shoot-and-run, to a side-scroller, to a flag based board. Wil takes the random duengon concept, and builds on it further, with delightful results. You\'ll find your attempt to escape from pursuit will take you to a pub, the clouds, a multicolored realm, and more. The worlds are brightly portrayed in Wil\'s bold graphics. His use of the ZZT colors has the ability to evoke even the grittyness of an alleyway or the sun beating down on you in the desert. In fact, part of the fun in Run-On is seeing what strange location you will enter next and what you are expected to accomplish to exit it. The 15 different locations to pass through makes the entertainment value of the game top notch. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe ending of the game is rather open ended, yet this is a benefit of the game. For it is not the destination that matters, but the journey. The ending is not as much of a conclusion to the plot as it is a revelation. The ending places a very familar image in relation to the game, and the comparison of the two subjects is very deep. It is much more powerful than a clear, ironed out resolution, it compells the player to sit there, staring at the screen, and think it over for a few seconds, for me a few minutes. And in a age of gaming where constant action is repititious and attention spans are at a low for some, these few moments are golden. <br><br>\r\n\r\nFor some icing on this ascii cake, the game also contains a mini game by Kkarios, DGN Ultimate, which is also randomly generated. But \"mini\" is hardly the word to describe it. With 100 levels total, expect this game to supply an additional hour of enjoyment. <br><br>\r\n\r\nYou\'d be missing out on a lot of what makes a great ZZT game magnificent if you do not download Run-On. But I have some basic instructions for you to avoid that: download Run-On, press \"P\", play, repeat. You can thank youself later for it.','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(33,'Featured Game: Warlock\'s Domain','Commodore','Featured Game','Imagine a game with epic scope contained within one castle. Imagine a game where your character\'s heroic qualities are undermined by other characters\' single-minded determination. Add a plot with wonderful twists, and gameplay that never gets boring and you\'ve got Warlock Domain. Alan Chan\'s first published game shows that he knows what\'s up in ZZT. Warlock Domain features all the aspects of a game made by a veteran ZZTer with a touch of rookie flavour. It\'s also a prequel of sorts to Alan\'s sadly unfinished Htrae saga, which is highlighted in a short but glorious demo: Htrae I : The Crimson Omen. <br><br>\r\n\r\nYou start the game with basic adventurer knowledge: Princess Daisy was kidnapped by the Warlock Daimon, all rescue attempts have failed. If Daimon marries the princess, he will take over the kingdom. You can\'t let this happen. With that you begin in front of Castle Shadow, Daimon\'s lair. Alan\'s subtle humour is apparent from the start as you try and talk your way past skeleton guard guarding the gate. This humour is what allows the game to flow so well. Jokes don\'t feel like they\'re jammed in to force a laugh, rather they are used purposely to develop the characters better. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAs soon as you enter the castle you\'ve got loads to do. A lot of the castle is open for you to walk through and explore. Each room is vastly varied and there isn\'t any space wasted. Puzzles present themselves immediately but the answers are not available right away. In some cases it\'s a \"find the right item\" sort of puzzle, this doesn\'t mean you don\'t have to think though. The other puzzles are original, fun and never annoying. The security system that guards the chalice, and the stuck switch are good examples. You\'re always on your toes in this game. Never are you bogged down with the tedious adventure thought process of \"I need this so I can get that to go there and get that to save blah blah blah.\" Instead you\'ve got mostly free reign over a majority of the castle. Can\'t go that way? That\'s okay. You\'ve got plenty of other places to explore. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOf course as you explore the castle, you must fight its inhabitants. The game doesn\'t falter here at all. Almost every fight is varied. There are the skeletons that you shoot with your arrows, the enchanted lions you kill with your sword (rouge-style), one of the bosses you defeat using a magic staff, in the cave there are pre-fab monsters(!), and then of course RPG battles. The RPG battles happen at a quick pace and are intense sometimes. It\'s a very good system, comparable to the one in Rhygar, and is used very well in the game. Some of the story even develops in the battles. Alan does a good job of switching it up. Combat is never tedious or boring. It happens in brief spurts which keeps the adventure going at a brisk pace. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAlan Chan\'s artistic abilities are well highlighted in Warlock Domain. While simplistic it shows that a great deal of effort was put in to designing the castle. Still Alan shines through this simplistic facade with some great effects. Daimon\'s taunting visage at the entrance of the castle, four skeleton guards merging to form Skeletor, the battle with Molloch, and the animations of monsters in the RPG battles all showcase both great drawing combined with great programming. The cutscenes, which don\'t show up until the end of the game, are few but look great. One of them features great animation as well. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMusic is the game\'s only weakness. It\'s not terrible, it actually adds to the game, but you\'ll probably be running for the \"B\" key when the ending sequence starts up. We hear a few Final Fantasy tunes in there and they help to create a good feeling while also giving a nod to the series. Overall I\'d rather have the music there rather than silence. The sound effects prove to be easier for Alan and there are a bunch of nice ones here. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWarlock Domain is my personal favourite ZZT game. It\'s fun and well written with strong characters and a great story. It\'s a shame the Haetre games never were completed. But we have Warlock Domain to satisfy our ZZT fantasy needs.

It\'s an adventure RPG, nearly 360kb in one ZZT file. It has a plot, which is actually slightly superfluous but serves nicely anyway. You are Rook, a nobleman exiled from the town of Gwin; after the death of your father, the mayor, your mother attempted to take over but spent the town\'s money badly- leading to a revolution leaving her stoned to death and you without a place to call home. However, you soon find yourself in another town, Bespin, and under an assumed identity you settle in a house you share with a friend called Dulcis. All seems well, until one day Aprithian assassins begin to show up around town for reasons unknown, and while running an errand for Jara you discover that Dulcis is not all that he seems to be... </br></br>For 1995, the graphics in this game are well done- plain by today\'s standards, but quite sufficent. There isn\'t much music (apparently the author can write it but doesn\'t like PC speaker sound much, and who can blame him), but what there is is quite decent; for some reason I especially liked the little beat played at the start of the game during the Mission:Enigma ripoff sequence. To this day it rings true in my mind! Gameplay is a defining factor of the game, too- it actually plays in the classic ZZT game format (ie. pre-programmed enemies, the occasional big boss object shootout), but does it in a distinctly medieval fantasy way (ruffians are assassins, lions are trolls, tigers are demons), and not all the enemies are pre-programmed.</br></br>Like any true RPG, what makes Sivion interesting is how 90% of the game is made up of side-quests which somehow tie into the bigger picture (ie. do x to get to y, and be rewarded with z). On your travels you\'ll save a man\'s fortunes from a malevolent djinn, defeat an evil Chthulu-style cult and steal from a bank vault in order to pay back a loan shark. All good family fun! Pretty much the first third of the game involves trying to get a poisoned needle, for exchange for strawberries from trolls, during which time you traverse mines and magic mazes and solve riddles to achieve what you require. Even after confronting the biggest boss of the game, don\'t be fooled into thinking you\'ve won; even after this, you must infiltrate a castle, journey across a desert and other such excitements. The sprawling nature of the quests you undertake does lead to a disjointed feel to the game, but it\'s mostly fun (not included; those goddamned darkened, invisible mazes)- and isn\'t that the point of a game?</br></br>The one major downer I have on this game are the regular plugs for the MegaZeux version, which is apparently way cooler than the ZZT version with a more involved plot, better developed characters, more game etc. Don\'t bother looking for it because it doesn\'t exist, past a tiny little five screen demo made in MZX v1. So forget that, just be content with what DOES exist. Bottom line; if you can run it, play it- if you can\'t, go get a new computer you stupid cheapskate.</br></br>\r\n(ps. for those of you who can\'t run Fred! 2 due to its being even huger than Sivion, the password is BARNEY.

Little Square Things is a extremely in-depth puzzle game that has infinite possibilities so far untapped. In the game you (a demigod deciding their fate) must guide the little square things through perilous traps and sticky situations to their ultimate goal, standing atop a cyan fake. Only until all the fakes are covered at the same time may you continue. Each key press you make affects every little square thing on the board, but not all the square things are created equal. The colour of the square thing decides how it will react to your key stroke. A white one will follow your move precisely whilst a black one will go the opposite of your move. Blue ones don\'t move unless pushed by other square things, and green ones shift their orientation to the cursor keys randomly. There are plenty of other types as well and each will keep you guessing and trying and swearing.<br><br>Gameplay consists of avoiding having any of the square things destroyed and ultimately getting them all to their goal. In your way are bullets, lava pits, and viruses. Keeping track of all the little square things on the board and what the next move will do to them is a good way to start, but not always the answer. Sometimes you have to race the clock as a bullet slowly ricochets its way around the board towards a helpless little square thing. Cyan square things don\'t stop moving until they hit an object and can lead to some very panicked situations at times. The tension is always high, and even if after a few tries you\'ve resolved to sit and think for a while, the tension will still be there when you attempt your new approach. It\'s almost like brain surgery.<br><br>Aside from the original gameplay, the way you progress through the levels is equally original and adds greatly to the amount of times that you can play the game. The levels are represented by a pyramid shaped map on the top left of the screen. Each time you beat a level, you progress further down pyramid. You get a choice of left or right and depending on which, the outcome of the game could be different. This means you only play through 7 of the 28 levels and easily (to lazy to figure out what math to use) over 50 different paths to take through them.<br><br>The game could have ended after the 7 levels and most people would be happy, but craNK adds yet another element, bosses. Here you try and race others demigod to prove that you are the supreme being. The two bosses are tseng and craNKGod himself. Beat them and you have beaten the game, but you still you\'ve got a lot more to do if you want to prove you are the master. Go back and start again!<br><br>Little Square Things is one of the most addictive ZZT game I have played. It you enjoy the game as much as I did, you download the editor and try and create your own levels.

The resulting game is like nothing before, or anything since.<br /><br />From the TXT file: \'...winter is a game based on atmosphere, instinct and intelligence. In some ways (whether good or bad), winter takes these tenets to an extreme...The result of this is that most puzzles must be figured out through other means -- through sight, sound, and intuition.\'<br /><br />Winter could technically be considered a \'trippy\' game. However it surpasses the usual weird fare and instead concentrates on creating a complex world that makes sense in its own way. Indeed the world created seems intimidating, but I\'ve yet to find a way to die, and many puzzles can be attempted multiple times without the need to restore and start over. Colours are used with great skill, defining each section of the game brilliantly. Interactions with objects are illustrated rather than described, and several times you need to use auditory clues to solve problems. The three sections that revolve around the Ice Palace can be played in any order, and the final puzzle at the end ties the entire game up wonderfully.<br /><br />The story is minimal, and appropriately so. You\'re in school, you start to day dream, and you find yourself standing in front of a large palace. Your goal, as stated, is to \'delve deeper\', however you soon find your task revolves around recovering three purple keys which you obtain after the completion of each area. Immediately the palace confuses you. Soon however, its inner working become clear and understandable. Understanding the palace soon gives you access to the different worlds, and the journey continues. The three worlds, as titled in the editor are: The Underground Forest, The Night Mesa, and The Mechanical Caverns.<br /><br />Each section seems meticulously planned out, with a wide variety of puzzles that never makes you think the same way twice. The forest has a variety of key puzzles combined with a puzzle that utilises board linking. The caverns has a new twist on the standard teleporter puzzle and a need logic puzzle. The mesa has a well designed (and tough!) bomb puzzle. Also, in the palace, is a nice, albeit easy, slider puzzle that involves touching an object that shifts the orientation of the sliders.<br /><br />Without much of a story, you could say that this is a puzzle game that keeps you playing though atmosphere rather than plot development. The rather ambiguous ending is expected and leaves you cringing for a sequel, however I don\'t think a sequel was ever planned. The idea that the main character has even more of this insanity left to figure out though, makes it seem like the world created is endless, rather than contained to the palace and its domains. Being thick in atmosphere is one thing, another is to keep it varied. Winter does this well. It\'s as thematically varied as A Dwarvish Mead Dream and keeps the same fresh pace without long sections of fighting. And of course the music is excellent, as it should be. A game like this with poor or no music would just not have the same effect.<br /><br />Winter is a great game for puzzle fans of all types. Only a few puzzles are daunting and all of them are original in some way. There are small puzzles, and large, multiple board puzzles. Even with the amount of puzzles in the game, there is still a great feeling of exploration and discovery, something that lacks in a lot of puzzle oriented games. Overall a masterpiece of originality that should be played by anyone looking to see how atmosphere can be achieved in ZZT.<br /><br />If you enjoy Winter, I suggest playing myth\'s 24hozzt game, Nightplanet.','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(37,'Featured Game: Ned the Knight','Zenith Nadir','Featured Game','So you\'re looking for something a bit different? You found Chrono Wars too wordy, Rhygar too serious, Burger Joint too short, Gem Hunter SE too pedantic? If so, you\'re a moron because those games are all great. But even so, you could do worse than take a look at Ned the Knight. In this game, you play the titular Ned, who begins the game as a knight-in-training living in the year 1000AD. After receiving a message from the king, you learn that you must undertake three tasks in order to become a fully-fledged Knight- you must retrieve a lost royal ring from the castle sewers, find and unlock a hidden room, and slay a dragon. A simple enough premise, perhaps- but it\'s just the start to a whole lot of trouble, and an adventure filled with odd bipedal little reptiles called goobers.<br /><br />Although the game is set with a definite level layout (ie. complete a certain task to move onto another, repeat as necessary), its geography is all interlinking and backwardly accessible- that is, the castle leads out to the town, outside the town is the forest, the forest leads to a cave through which there is a beach and arena, and so on. But I\'m getting ahead of myself, and I\'m giving away things you probably should discover on your own so I\'ll speak of specifics. The graphics in this game are a treat- they\'re simple but bold and atmospheric, and give a definite cartoony feel to the game, although the first few boards feel somewhat basic. Wherever you are, be it a town, a forest or mountains, you really do feel convinced by the graphics- they have a unique charm unmatched in any ZZT game before or since (except maybe *p0p*). Special mention must go to the big bosses you\'ll encounter- although ZZT\'s limitations stop them from moving around, they are all animated in such a way you feel they\'re somehow more than a couple of objects tied to solids and a few invisible walls throwing stars at you. Extra special mention goes to Zlabfrinz the Goober King, the last boss in the game and an amazing piece of programming.<br /><br />Speaking of whom, the one negative point I have regarding this game is that final puzzle where you have to beat the goobers in a certain order. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. Well, no, I managed it once, but that was a long, long time ago. And that board gives you a runtime error! Other than that mishap, the gameplay is diverse and engaging- mostly it involves shooting arrows or hitting stuff with your sword, or beating memory puzzles and finding secrets and items/advice needed to continue onwards. All very simple, usual RPG kinda things, but again, done in an entertaining, well-humoured manner.<br /><br />The music in this game is noteworthy, too. As well as incidental music, when each board is first visited a little bit of background music will play as way of introduction. This is probably the nearest ZZT will ever get to background music, and it\'s strangely effective. The actual music is pretty listenable, so I\'d keep your speaker sound on for this one.

Yet even without STK, Ryan Riegel\'s Legend of Brandonia is an excellent adventure game with a great story that takes you to all sorts of weird and excellent places.<br /><br />You play Alex, a knight of Brandonia, serving under King Brandon. You start out just after escorting the king to the castle, returing from a mission. You get to wander the castle and talk to your wife, and it\'s not long before you learn about the contest.<br /><br />Every forty years, the dragon lays its eggs. When this happens a race is held in Brandonia to be the first one back with an undamaged egg. Alex decides to join the race, but before the race begins, Alex learns about his father\'s death. He goes to investigate and discovers that a man named Acro stole Alex\'s father\'s teleportation device. Acro plans to use the device to win the race. Alex tries to tell the king, but the race begins and Acro is long gone. So the adventure begins...<br /><br />Legend of Brandonia is a long game, 256k, that is actually the first part of a game that was never finished. The game play is typical, shooting at enemies, but rarely gets tedious. All of the enemies are objects, no prefab lions and tigers. There are puzzles, but nothing daunting. All around, Legend of Brandonia is a fairly easy game. There are a few difficult spots, like the cave and the fight on the dock, but in general the challenge is moderate. The programming is quite tight, with good use of zap/restore, allowing characters to progress different parts of the story at different times, and some good effects including a ship coming into port.<br /><br />The only music in the game is on the title, but it is excellent.<sup>1</sup> Throughout the game there are short chimes and sounds to mark when something has been done and some of the sounds come directly from ZZT, like the unlocking a door sound effect.<br /><br />Legend of Brandonia is an epic game with a well written story that will keep you playing to the end. It\'s a shame Ryan Riegel never stayed around to do the second part, it would have been brilliant. Still this game stands well on its own, and should be played, along with Warlock Domain, by anyone even considering doing a fantasy game in ZZT.

Inspired by this, Zenith Nadir went on to create the classic ZZT action game, Lebensraum.<br /><br />Lebensraum is responsible for inspiring and influencing the next generation of ZZT action shooters, bringing us such classics as <a href=\"http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/?p=database&search=i3.zip\">Infestation 3</a>, etc. In Lebensraum, you play Jim Cowvitz, a hard man of action who has been sent into the fortress of Lebensraum to discover the Nazis\' plans, helping to speed up the end of World War II, which has dragged on for too long. Naturally, as with all hard men of action, you get captured shortly after getting to the bottom of it all, and take up residence in a POW camp. Naturally, as with all hard men of action, you manage to get your hands on a particularly sharp piece of rock, with which you take out the guard and steal his gun. Heh heh. Time to kick some Nazi butt.<br /><br />What makes Lebensraum special is that when Zenith decided to make an action Wolfenstein style game, he didn\'t just make a bunch of crappy objects and paste it together with nice art. The work he has done on this game is very obvious, as it literally oozes with quality. Let\'s take a look at some of the features that Lesbensraum pioneered:<br /><br />As you start the game, you are given a choice between four different difficulty levels. No, those were not put there just to look nice, there is a noticeable change in the ease of play. For instance, when you start the game on its easiest level, then open the door, you find two SA guards and some health. When playing on the hardest difficulty level, you will find no less than five guards waiting for you, and no first aid kits. Which brings us to another unique point. In a dose of realism, you cannot see the contents of a room, or what lies beyond a corner, until you go in, whereat you will find death, life, or an assortment of the two. The guards, captains, and officers are all sophisticated as necessary in their AI, ranging from dispatched with easily to mildly amusing to aggravatingly difficult. And the dogs will give you nightmares for the next few nights to come. Of course, you won\'t have limitless health and ammunition. The maximum amount of ammo is 99, health 100, so it is necessary to strategize. However, your health is easy to watch through the fact that on the bottom of every screen is a status bar displaying your condition, be it 100%, Good, or Poor.<br /><br />All these innovative elements combine to form Lebensraum, the fun and definitive ZZT action game, with loads of replayability. This is a game that deserves to be played and studied before you attempt to make a game of this genre, and I highly recommend it to all aspiring game authors.','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(40,'Featured Game: Banana Quest','Homz','Featured Game','After two months of doubtless very hard work, WiL, a relatively unknown ZZTer at the time, released Banana Quest. He later became one of the most acclaimed game authors of all time, ranked highly in countless 24hozzts, ranked bottom-most in others, became known as the greatest musician ever to grace ZZT, and, during his best years, produced some of the finest games to be found, including Run-On, The Rose, and Largo Abraxis, among others. Among all these games, though, Banana Quest is my very favorite, and is, I think, my favorite ZZT game ever made.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nPerhaps it\'s the rather whimsical insanity, perhaps the sheer fun and novelty value, perhaps the clever cheerfulness and hopelessly optimistic attitude which could only come from a time long passed over by the commune. Perhaps it\'s the theme song, or, even, the fact that, beside the original ZZT games and Code Red, it\'s one of the very first ZZT games I ever played, those few years ago when I first discovered ZZT and Z2.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nBut that\'s quite enough sentimental meandering. What reason have _I_ to play this game, you ask, and so shall your question be answered!<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nBanana Quest concerns the adventures of our hero, Bov Boy (seriously, don\'t ask), who resides peacefully on a quiet, lush, tropical island, until the mysterious scalawag MR. SCRUTHERS kidnaps his girlfriend, Chelsea, and trundles off to The Hills. Obviously, he realizes, he must pursue them quickly, making chase with the motorboat conveniently located on the island. But, alas, things will not be so easy, for he discovers that the MAN WITH THE HAND HELD MONKEY IS BLOCKING HIS WAY, and will not pass until the monkey is appeased with a set number of bananas. So our hero gets to the task, fighting against the odds, sweeping the Mayor\'s kitchen, staring down potatoes, and diving deep into the reaches of the Bigg Mitt to retrieve the Mystical Red Banana before he finally meets up with Mr. Scruthers in the climatic ending.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThe game is considerably boosted by WiL\'s strong yet deceptively simple graphics style, which completely complements the game, remaining consistently fantastic, and providing suitably insane visuals for the Man With the Hand-Held Monkey and Banana Isle, while still leaving room for the menace seen in Mr. Scruther\'s eyes. The music of course, is classic WiL, and exudes charm and warmth, adding to the overall ambience of the game.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nIn terms of gameplay, the game is fantastic, and bears certain traits of the item-hunting genre tseng invented with his Gem Hunter games without ever seeming unoriginal or copied. It is extremely varying and fresh, never seeming repetitive or tiring. Overall, I personally found the game pretty hard (particularly the avocado transmogrifier engine, which I was stuck at for something close to a year, but merely requires a bit of common sense and persistence to complete), and once you get into the second file, there are some sticky parts which can make the game unwinnable and force you to enter your password in again and start that section over, but, besides one other slight programming error in the password entry (which shouldn\'t affect you unless you end the first file with a yellow banana still in your possession) which, from ZZT\'s editor, is easily fixed anyways, the gameplay is nearly flawless fun. On top of this, there\'s a clever little Sierra-style score system which adds an extra challenge, providing one point each for touching objects, talking to people, or performing tasks that are unnecessary to complete the game.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nBanana Quest is a fun, fantastic game that has rarely been rivaled in gameplay value and it leaves me with almost a sense of regret to have finally finished this charming gem. This is an often passed over, yet excellent ZZT game that you should definitely not miss the chance to play.<BR /><BR />','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(41,'Featured Game: Dungeon Master\'s Gallery','Commodore','Featured Game','Dungeon Master Gallery could easily be the benchmark for dungeon crawl games in ZZT. The story is purposely vague, and appropriately, the game is very linear, with each board comprising a floor of the level, and all the levels descending and increasing in difficulty.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThe game uses arrows(shooting) as your mode of dispatching foes, and being conservative with your shots is a must, especially if you plan on beating the last boss, who is difficult and well programmed, disappearing and ambushing you for different directions. Most enemies will only take a shot to kill, but some tougher, \"unique\" monsters will present themselves. Each level is dark, and requires torches, which are found around on the walls. All the items can be bought from the treasure you loot. Buying items is required, but in general, most of your ammo and torch needs will be met by scrounging the dungeon, provided you work quickly and conserve. There are some pre-programmed enemies, but only STK variations of ruffians, the smartest of the built-ins, so they will keep you on your toes.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThe levels are varied and there are a number of characters that will help you on your way, sell you things, and generally add colour to the game. Figuring out how these characters work might not happen your first time through, providing an ample excuse to replay the game. There are plenty of interactive objects and some side quests, and nearly everything that looks touchable is.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nGraphically the game looks good, with a variety of styles not limited to the standard look of \"3D\" walls, and each new area is soaked in atmosphere, appropriate monsters, and interesting little bits of side story to keep things interesting. The final areas is where this is most apparent. The title screen is pretty as well.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nDo you dare? Does the darkness call you? It\'d better, especially to those with an interest in making any sort of dungeon game. The surface simplicity combined with hidden complexity makes this a game to slice apart and discover what makes it tick. If you enjoy slogging through blood, battling past evil monsters, and generally kicking ass as the all important, totally generic hero, this is the game for you.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nWant more gore?

An original review for this landmark game would be most welcome.</I><BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nAura is the second major release of Dr. Dos\', and depending on your perspective on community games like Mooseka Richtlinen mit einer Eisenfaust, may be remembered as his best. It is an action/strategy game hybrid with influences from eastern philosophy, Ikaruga, and of course, ADOM.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nIn an alternate plane where every being, except of course karmics such as yourself, has an aura of either blue, green, or red, imbalance has occurred and the aurae are struggling against one another. You\'re out to change all that, even if it means destroying everything in the universe. Dr. Dos refers to these as the \'extinction\' endings, comprising three of seven possible conclusions to the game (not counting death), one of the games\' most recommending features.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you\'d just like to have one aura dominate, and then face the boss of that particular aura and lay down some good ol\' fashioned karmic whoop-ass, using your unique ability to change aurae to meet that of your opponents. And you\'re going to be doing that a lot.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nSo you run around changing your aura as you meet your opponents. It sounds simple enough, but the levels ascend in difficulty reasonably evenly, and there are one or two that took me four or five save/die/restore attempts to complete. Others are a cakewalk, however. The enemies vary in strength and intelligence, while each aura maintains its own distinct characteristics (red creatures won\'t even move toward you much if at all, but they hurt a lot if you do contact them - but the blue ones are the true nasties).<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nOne problem with the game is that at points it can get tedious. I would have been interested had Dos included some slightly less action-oriented puzzles - buttons that change the aura of opponents, or open gates, or using objects, or similar linear puzzles, in the vein of the development that craNKGod introduced into Little Square Things. That would have been neat. Some music or sound for the game would also have been nice (said MadTom, who was asked to do just that).<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nGraphics are one of Dos\' self-confessed weaknesses, but what the game lacks in an aesthetic sense is made up for in reasonably in-depth level design and a somewhat addictive, though appropriately simple, premise. I can\'t, for reasons obvious, comment on the title screen and menu.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nAura is not an easy game. You are not going to beat it, regardless of your choice of ending, without saving/dying/restoring at least a few times. There are several tricks and traps, some obvious and predictable, others quite nasty. You are likely to learn a few strategies ... which aura is best for the very first steps of each level?<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThe Ultimate Karmic God ending in particular is reasonably (but not incredibly) difficult to get. The only advice I will offer you is to have a good stockpile of health. Actually, that applies to just about every level of the game ... good thing health bonuses are reasonably abundant.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nAll in all, the game is one of the best uploads to the site this year, appropriately also being the very last one uploaded. Dr. Dos\' skill as a ZZTer puts him easily within the range of Quantum P., Commodore, and other present-day whizkids of the ZZTing scene, and I\'m very much looking forward to his next release.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nGood job, Dos!','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(43,'Featured Game: Frost 1; Power','MadTom','Featured Game','This particular Featured Game will not come as much of a surprise to anyone active in the community. The game marking the return of ZZTing legend Zenith Nadir to full-game ZZTing after a hiatus of three years, <I>Frost 1; Power</I>, is an astonishing powerhouse of a cinema game that will be a lasting testament to his perhaps unequalled skill.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThe action of this first part of <I>Frost</I>, after a short and spooky teaser in the Xal Highlands, takes place on the planet Ilititoa. We join our heroine Penny Sha?well in a Gian highschool, reading <I>Speeduck</I> and about to begin her swordplay lessons; all is therefore well in the world of anthropomorphic bushy-tailed canids. Later that afternoon, however, an unfortunate mishap involving unintentionally blasting the living shit out of a school bully means she is forced to undergo the decidedly unpleasant punishment of exile from her homeland, so she makes her way South to Alsace, leaving her friends, parents, and younger brother Mist behind.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nEquipped with her mother\'s sword, for which competence is now so necessary, and slaying such dreaded foes as polliwogs and bloodflies, Penny is forced to make a detour to a haunted swamp. There, she meets ... or rather gets her ass saved by ... the mysterious swamp witch Henna Sullrune, student of the late Silver Blood, with whom she continues her journey ...<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nAs the screenshots shown here imply, the main strength of this cinema game is its graphics, in my mind pretty much unprecedented in a full game. Zenith\'s graphical competence was always improving (compare, for example, subsequent versions of Chickenwire), but he\'s in his element, here. The characters and the setting (forest and swamp) are drawn with meticulous attention to details such as weather, with Zenith\'s trademark skylines permeating throughout. The mood of the game is well set by its graphics, and the whole thing is actually complete eye candy.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThe gameplay involved here is nothing fantastically original, but it works; there\'s a nice sword-practice engine at the start, and the rest of the game is either fight or flight from the numerous foes who seem rather hellbent on being a serious impediment to Penny\'s journey. The writing itself is detailed (and rather lengthy, but fortunately interesting enough to keep the player reading) and clever, with occasional authorial interjections such as \"I AM CONSUMED WITH MISPLACED GUILT\", which have received mixed reactions from reviewers; personally, I rather like them. They prevent the game from getting too melancholy, too soon, which is a risk it could otherwise have seriously run.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThe music, unfortunately, sucks.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThose of you interested in ancient history (see <A HREF=\"http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/?p=database&search=ultraw.zip\">Ultra Whack</A>, for example) will be well aware that the development of the world and the characters in Frost has been going on for a long time, resulting in what seems a very cohesive and well-planned setting. Granted, that makes for a lot of \"exposition\" (word borrowed from John W. Wells), but with purdy art and dialogue and the occasional quip, that isn\'t really so bad.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nFrost 1; Power is a new entry on my list of favourite ZZT games (yes, I do keep a written list), and I would definitely recommend it for download.

A cinematically-inclined comedy using Zaphod`, aka Deathwinter, the Mooseka Z2 administration, and the Weekend of ZZT as its bases, <I>MRWAIF</I> is a very well-written, lighthearted, well-drawn <strike>by Nadir</strike> comedy that has hooked some rave reviews on Z2 and given Dos his much-deserved place in the limelight.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nAs Zaphod`, while chatting to Dr. Dos one day over AIM in a stained shirt, the shredded remains of your will to live are burnt to ashes as you are informed that your worst enemy, Mooseka, is now the unquestioned head administrator of Z2. The naturally following anxiety attack, marked by a conveniently transcribed panicky scream ... \"haaaaaaaaaaaaa\" ... causes you to black out. Thus begins a haze of suicidal activity with the expected GODEDRP clich?s of his daddy\'s shotgun and a family pack of aspirin, to the background music of <A HREF=\"http://www.nin.com/\">Nine Inch Nails\'</A> <i>Hurt</I>.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nUpon awakening near the Wikkit gate in a platform detached from time and space, and exploring a bit, the discovery of a quarter on the ground prompts a bizarre discrepancy between the laws of Newton and Murphy, and you begin a gravitational tailspin into another area of the plane, whereupon you meet other banned members of Z2. Apparently, your having fallen from the sky fulfills a prophecy that they shall successfully overthrow Mooseka and have Z2 destroyed ... with your assistance, of course. Discovering your ability to turn invisible by grinning like a Cheshire cat lends some hope to the expedition, and after a brief meeting, and an unfortunate accident involving Boxtop and a bushy-tailed canid, you and your new friends set out for Z2 to stop the Weekend of ZZT in its tracks and expose Mooseka for the malevolent, destructive dictator he is.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThe thing that stands out most in <I>MRWAIF</I> is the strength of Dr. Dos\' writing. Reliant as it may be on the derision of community members (most of whom, Zaphod` included, apparently played the game and loved it), it is in places very, very funny and creative. We\'re not talking just a set of quotes pasted around a banal adventure, though; Dos has made a reasonably elaborate plot for his characters to follow. Most of the humour is in one-liner or slapstick forms rather than in long, elaborate jokes, which engages the player\'s interest effectively. A community member not familiar with the various catchphrases and furry tendencies of some of the characters would not get as much out of the game as a long-standing community member, but the game is fortunately not <i>over</i>-reliant on inside jokes, and even newcomers should find it an entertaining cinema game. My favourite scene is probably a tie between the invasion of the Z2 building, and Knightt\'s death scene.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nThe artwork is not Dr. Dos\', but was commissioned from Zenith Nadir. Unfortunately, Zenith never got around to actually finishing the artwork, and as a result there are some glaring bare boards with Dos\' text instructions as to what is supposed to be drawn. It is a shame that Dos didn\'t have a go at his own graphical work, but it turned out all right in the end; what Zenith has submitted is, as is to be expected, very good and fitting with the tenor of the game - I personally find the way he draws Zaphod`, with the understanded facial features, hilarious.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nA cameo game like this one strikes me as much more creative than, for example, classic cameo romps like <I>Sim #darkdigital</I>, and I think it\'s a step in the right direction for an increasingly tight-knit community in which everyone seems to know everyone else. It would be easy to dismiss <I>MRWAIF</I> as just a flash in the pan exploiting catchphrases and references to make its point, or as a cruel and unprovoked cheapshot against community scapegoats, but it deserves more than that; it\'s very, very funny, and well-drawn (to a point). It\'s a real shame it\'s technically incomplete, and that Dos didn\'t try to do the graphics himself, but otherwise it\'s highly recommended; I\'ve yet to speak with anyone in the community who claims they don\'t like it, and even Eurakarte disliked <I>Frost</I>.<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\nGood work, Dr. Dos!<BR /><BR />\r\n\r\n<I>This review is nominally adapted from MadTom\'s original MTP review, which can be found </I><A HREF=\"http://zzt.the-underdogs.org/mtp/awards/june04.html\">here</A>.<BR /><BR />','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(45,'Featured Game: Death','Commodore','Featured Game','A fine example of a ZZT shooter filled with atmosphere and depth, _Death_ combines the nonsensical and the grim with the grit of classic ZZT game play. The game puts you in the shoes of a soldier who has awoken in a strange land after being used for experimental drug testing in the enemy\'s prison camp. You quickly learn that the ruler of the realm, and the being that you are destined to battle, is called the Tatvatt. The game has you fight your way past demons and zombies through over thirty floors of the Tatvatt\'s castle before finally confronting the evil god himself.\r\n<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\nA large game, clocking in at 320k, _Death_ keeps the action fresh throughout. Each floor is a well designed level loaded with traps and treasure. The dark boards are especially effective using a cramped layout so that no matter where you stand there is always a point of reference. The enemies are almost exclusively programed objects with distinct behavior and they often jump you after picking up an object or opening a door. Durable zombies will tax your ammo supply and force you into corners. Demons come in two flavors and are the main shooting enemy. Rats are surprisingly resilient and devious. One enemy throws \"parts of its own body\" that become creatures unto themselves. In ZZT terms this means that it shoots bears. The final boss may annoy those that can not stand stars, but he doesn\'t take too many shots to kill. Saving often is a must. The places where enemies end up doing the most damage usually surprise you. The game never ceases to keep you on your toes. The puzzles (what few there are) are a nice distraction but aren\'t particularly special and by no means the main attraction.\r\n<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\nAesthetically this game holds its own, though you may tire of the abundance of dark grey and red. A lot of what holds the graphics together is how well each floor is designed. Line walls are used heavily in certain areas, but creatively. Small details help aid the graphics such as decaying trees with poisonous fruit and murky pools. The opening boards sets the mood perfectly and the minimalist title screen adds mystery. The end consists of\r\ntwo quality art boards. Though a far cry from a dynamic score, the sounds do a great deal in helping promote the atmosphere and almost everyone you talk to has a theme that plays when you first talk to them.\r\n<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\nDarren Hewer\'s previous full length game Dr. Zeebo\'s Mystical Quest is similar in many respects, especially in its layout, but _Death_ is far more refined and more devoted to the shooting concept where Dr Zeebo was more interested in mixing puzzles into the equation. The game serves as a solid example of quality game play and design, and the game has a good \"finished\" feel to it. It\'s virtually bug free save the exploding arrows.

Sonic256\'s only release, the game follows the ZZT staple \"wake up and save the world\" plot mixing plenty of humour and some clever programming tricks. The game opens with you waking up in a cave and getting a quest to kill a mean dude. You then roam around an open field area killing some pre-fab enemies and\r\ncollecting goods to prepare for your dive into a cave and fight with a boss. After you are teleported to a spaceship hovering over the world and from there on you can either prevent or cause the Earth\'s destruction. The ending is different depending on how much health and ammo you have.\r\n<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\nGame play is simple and uses ZZT\'s built in enemies as fodder, but this is a short game and it does not require much effort to progress the plot or make something interesting happen. Indeed the charm of this game (past its well structured design) is the humour and choices you can make. Do you bribe the computer? or kick it? Make a pass at the evil leader? Well\r\nwritten dialogue combined with a sharp wit makes this game very enjoyable. Though there are a few pop references, they are just as humourous if taken as non-sequitur. The boss in the middle of the game is a good fight as he spews enemies that change into gems and ammo after you hit him with a shot. The game\'s only puzzles, outside of making the correct menu choice, are good ones yet don\'t require a lot of effort.\r\n<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\nThe game looks its age, but the graphics are clean and there is a good number of musical pieces that really set the mood well. The title screen is a neat little animation and you can already tell what sort of game you are going to play just by looking at it. It does not succumb to any syndromes and from what I could tell the game is bug free if you don\'t count a door that doesn\'t #lock. (You shouldn\'t have touched it twice anyways.) The STK in the game is used well for the time, though a lot of areas in the field lack texture, in the end it doesn\'t matter. There is a simplistic looking city cut scene at the end that serves its purpose very well.\r\n<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\nThis game is a featured game because it does everything right.

Innovative engines and graphical touches liven up this fine game while the atmosphere drips with feeling and draws you in.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe adventure starts on top of a tree. Apparently you have just eaten a shroom known as a Pepper Bolette and now are in the land of the unconscious. Your quest is to wake up, and to do so you must find some purple keys. To complete your quest you must learn to use the backpack. Operating it is done using ?-m, which links you to the inventory board. Initially the backpack is confusing, but it\'s not difficult to navigate. From it you will select items that you need at appropriate times, and choose which weapon you want to use. Now familiarised with the system, you are thrust into a cave and begin your adventure.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSaving is something you should become used to in this difficult game. Since initially you must pay for health (which is too expensive), losing life in places is as good as dying. Sent unarmed into the world, your first job is to find a weapon. This is no easy task. As soon as you emerge from the cave there are a total of three different areas you can immediately access, though entering the wrong area without proper armament or item is usually suicide. Much of the game follows this mold. Poking around aimlessly is key to winning, but once you find out where to go, restore and try to get there as effectively as possible.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMonsters are nasty, and if you don\'t have a gun, melee combat is not always wise. Early on, and even later, a good strategy is to avoid enemies altogether, though this is not always possible. Once you get to a location where a character will fill your health and ammo for free, things get a lot smoother. Hunting out items is the key to the game. Some are useful, some are essential, but most all of them are hidden or require some fighting to obtain. Just remember, don\'t explore while you have a purple key; it\'s a waste to have to backtrack to a key especially if you dodged more enemies than you killed on the way there.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe enemy designs are sinister, and clever. Frogs lick at you from a distance with their tongues, and rats circle around as you try and shoot them. On top of that, they are fast. The game instructs you to play at a higher speed, but should you find yourself swamped, don\'t hesitate to turn it down a notch. The graphics are quite unique and impressive in many places. Objects are used to animate pounding rain, water dripping off of trees and dead leaves falling from branches. Each area is colourful and diverse, with a distinct feel. Sprawling map locations complete the effect of detailed areas. The programming is top notch. Aside from graphical effects there are neat touches like the frogs actually spitting a tongue at you, or an actual centipede made of objects. The large frog is a highlight where you can get eaten by it or blow it up. The inventory system works well and is a welcome change from menu styled inventory systems of the past, though because duplicator noise is omnipresent, I advise playing with the sound off.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe characters are rather crazy. Their facial expressions are drawn next to their dialogues, and every one, minor or otherwise, is distinct. There are several in-jokes and probably references only the author and his friends would get, but the zany atmosphere of locations like the hotel in the volcano and the mushroom village makes up for things you do not understand. After all you did eat a mushroom, you expect sense?<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe main drawback of the game is its severe difficulty level. Gems are in low supply and you should not expect to recoup your losses buying heath after traveling in an area. Health and ammo are expensive which is a pain when enemies are difficult to kill. It could easily be called unfair. A couple of cheats is nothing you should be ashamed about, especially to get to some of the more impressive parts of the game. Despite the early hangups and limited resources, Pepper Bolette is a hugely creative game.','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(48,'Featured Game: Eli\'s House','Commodore','Featured Game','It\'s time to recognise some real new talent in ZZT. Gingermuffins has already done great things with contests and the Mel Gibson game Sugartits. Here it all comes together in this excellent game. A shortened version of a project originally entitled Vinegar Gulf, Eli\'s House does not feel like a game that has been pared down. It\'s absolutely huge and you are bound to miss plenty of things the first play though. The sense of exploration achieved is comparable to Warlock Domain and Kudzu. Each feature of the world is captivating from the story to the graphics and it makes exploring exciting and interesting.<br><br>\r\n\r\nYou start the game navigating a hedge maze in an attempt to gain access to a mansion. Your hero\'s origins are vague, as are his reasons for entering the house. Eventually you meet some other people who are trying to explore the house, and together you work to solve the mystery of the house and its elusive owner. The characters are well defined and mysterious, revealing more and more about who they are as the game progresses which rewards game play. Much of the house is open to exploration and figuring out how to open that next door is much of the charm. Eli\'s House will have you shooting things occasionally, but not much, and the game leans heavily into the adventure category. Puzzles involve remembering who wants what item, or getting clues as to secrets from people or objects. The game requires a bit of thought, but that\'s not to say it doesn\'t involve quick reflexes. Several of the obstacles to overcome require thinking on your toes, the sewer area being a fine example. Health is limited which means you must be careful, but the experience is not frustratingly difficult and actually makes the game more engaging and addictive.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGraphically, this is gin at his best. The design of the mansion is varied and colours are used well. There are lots of interesting rooms that all have their own feel and style, which when combined in the game leads to a very immersive experience. Objects are used well graphically. Subtle animations and the occasional cut scene rounds out a diversely illustrated game. The music is effective, and the pleasant, mood-setting tunes are short and sweet. All of the above considered, the polish of this game is one of its most impressive features.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe open ended quality of the first file is underused in the second, but it is just as large and twice as difficult. Things also get a little more weird. Traps here are devious and it\'s important to save often here. The Virtual Reality room is spooky. Later there is a sort of RPG fight, then you climb the windmill and move on to beat the game. The final sequences are exciting and satisfyingly climactic.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few areas in this game, though you are not required to visit some of them to complete the game. Playing this game you get the great feeling that you will never see everything. Packed with fun puzzles that challenge you mind and your reflexes, Eli\'s House is one of the best games to come around in a long time. A must for fans of adventure games. For examples of a finely finished game, balancing game play, story, and graphics, the aspiring ZZTer will want to take this one to heart.','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(49,'Featured Game: Smiley Guy & Toxic Terminator','qrleon','Featured Game','Al Payne only released two ZZT games, but they are very good ones.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Smiley Guy</b> was one of the six winners of the Epic\'s \"ZZT\'s Revenge\" contest (along with Ezanya). Unlike those other five, Smiley Guy employs a lot of object enemies and gives the player more support through health and hint kiosks. Although the writing and dialogue may occasionally come off as rigid, the quality and level of detail put into the game itself is very heartwarming. Not to mention the setting (a \"living lab\") is atypical of ZZT games and well illustrated with plenty of line and object tiles, as opposed to just being a bunch of square rooms with yellow borders. It contains a lot of maze puzzles, occasionally warranting a change in program speed, but hey, it\'s a game. (And it\'s better than the usual invis-o-maze crap.) One could say that this is the first ZZT game to not play exactly like Town of ZZT.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Toxic Terminator</b>, Smiley Guy\'s followup, was made the following year, and it continues the same general design (weird locations, maze puzzles, hint system) over a longer adventure. Released two years before the STK colour set was made public, Payne drew up several interesting screens that still look pretty cool to this day. My only real gripe with it is a dark maze that you\'re told to navigate without any torches. There were descriptive clues as you bumped into certain walls ... maybe I\'m just dumb, but it didn\'t make any sense to me.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBesides that one gripe, Smiley Guy & Toxic Terminator are good quality, upper-tier stuff somehwhat reminiscent of various computer adventure and puzzle games from the mid-to-late 80\'s. There\'s really not much else to say about them since they speak for themselves very well. Definitely try them if you haven\'t before!','','1970-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(50,'Game of the Month Review: Burger Joint','bongo','Featured Game','Burger Joint is, in my opinion, one of the most innovative games released for ZZT in rather a long time. Matt Dabrowski (Madguy) has thus far put out two really quite incredible games, the futuristic RPG epic War-Torn and now the undefinable Burger Joint.<br><br>\\\"But bongo,\\\" you stammer. \\\"What\'s so damn innovative about Burger Joint?\\\" For starters, the game takes place on one board, in one day. (Well, not exactly one board, but all the boards are alike, so for all intents and purposes one board.) Quite a change from today\'s modern overblown RPG epics spanning three ZZT worlds that eventually have to be cancelled due to runtime errors. (No, I\'m not bitter.) Madguy\'s game manages to pack a hell of a lot into one board, and every single bit of it gets used during the game. To top it all off, it\'s all really, really funny. There\'s never a moment where you wince at a bad joke, or where you fantasize about beating Madguy over the head with a socket wrench. The jokes all work, and the gameplay is surprisingly pretty balanced, the puzzles escalating in difficulty as you go along. It\'s quite an enjoyable game to play.<br><br>The plot revolves around young Johnny, a kid going to work for the first fast-food restaurant in the 50\'s. (Not historically accurate, but cool nonetheless.) He basically has to survive one day. Seems easy, right? You\'re wrong. Really weird stuff happens during the day, including but not limited to the murder of a restaurant competitor, a jock intent on pulverizing you and a terrorist invasion. And there\'s even a romantic subplot happening in the wings. The characters all have defined personalities (especially Roy, who is heavily involved in probably the funniest scene of the game), and weird running jokes are hidden throughout all of the various objects of the restaurant.<br><br>The graphics are quite good, especially for a one-board game. But what really makes the game shine is the sound. 50\'s pop hits are cannibalized and turned into PC speaker tunes, various original themes help to add to the story, and there\'s even a Grease parody. If you play this game with the sound turned off, may God have mercy on your soul.<br><br>At any rate, get this game. It\'ll give you a good laugh, and also make you damned glad that you downloaded it.<br><br>-bongo','','1998-07-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(51,'Game of the Month Review: Chrono Wars 9','bongo','Featured Game','Some consider this game to be the pinnacle of the CW series, me among them. The earlier flaws of the series (come on, you all must have hated that damn get-through-the-shifting-maze-in-9-seconds-or-so part in CW 1 too) are pretty much done away with, and the challenge is quite well balanced. The game also has probably the longest playing time of the series and is also the first to feature player switching, allowing for a huge cast, each with their own special abilities - and making getting the right combination to solve the puzzles an exceptionally sticky wicket. \r\n\r\nThe plot doesn\'t figure in as heavily with this installment as in the others, aside from a few encounters as you climb the Alliance Tower. But this isn\'t much of a flaw; you\'ll be too damn busy trying to get up to the top to read about the time theorems and evil doings of Mr. C. \r\n\r\nThe puzzles are, of course, the main part of any CW game. CW9 doesn\'t skimp on them whatsoever, and the new twist of character selection is added. Although some of the characters really don\'t do too much (*cough* Asher 2 *cough*), the others have rather a nice variety of skills. And midway through the game, there\'s an RPG battle where your character selections become rather vital to winning the fight. I personally prefer this fight to the one in CW10 for some reason, I have no clue why. \r\n\r\nThe graphics don\'t skimp either. They\'re all quite amazingly well done, with lots of little blinking and flashing bits and details, and it really looks like a Tower of Technology. \r\n\r\nThe game\'s main flaw is that the character selection routine is really, really annoying, since you have to trudge all the way back to the foyer to switch out party members. Chronos fixes this annoyance in CW10, but here, it\'s still damned bothersome. And you\'d better like saving a lot- a lot of the puzzles are amazingly tricky, or are set up so that you won\'t know it\'s a puzzle until you walk into it (here I am thinking of the security camera in the prison.) Still, the challenge is a lot more even here than the previous games. \r\n\r\nIn short, this is the shining gem of the CW series.

But I talked to Abbott about it, and he agreed that it deserved the honors, so here we are. \r\n\r\nWhat\'s so great about pop? tuc himself billed it as his kudzu-esque game, a title which it rather richly deserves. Pop is all about atmosphere, and it delivers in spades. The game feels like Alice in Wonderland on acid, with garish guava-groves, a delicious meal with uuros maluuros, brightly designed hallways and a stampeding statue. tuc\'s excellent sense of humor also shines through rather often... from the definition of parakeet in the dictionary to the guy who says 50 things to the brilliant ending, possibly the best ever to grace a ZZT game. The puzzles are also quite well-done... I was stumped for rather a long time for how to proceed past the statue. But the puzzle difficulty is in an inverse ration to how far into the game you are, so it\'s a lot harder to start than finish, which tucan may have intended as a metaphor or not. \r\n\r\nThe game does have a few flaws... the aforementioned easiness of the later puzzles, for one, and the bugs that were present in the version that I played (tho\' I understand that he\'s fixed those.) The fun of playing, however, far eclipses my nitpicky gripes. \r\n\r\nAnd to those concerned with replay over all: even if you do manage to beat the game, however, the real meat of the thing only comes once you\'ve found all 8 of the gems in the game, which are quite well hidden (and there are a thousand temptations taunting you to spend them, so you\'ve got to be careful!) \r\n\r\nFlaws aside, pop is simply brilliant. It\'s quite rare that a game like this appears, and top honors are well deserved by tucan, one of the greatest ZZT miracle workers of all time. \r\n\r\n-bongo','','1998-09-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(53,'Game of the Month Review: Ned the Knight','bongo','Featured Game','This is one of those games that should be right up there with or past Mission: Enigma as the be-all end-all of ZZT games, but never really gets the attention it deserves.

The plot isn\'t the major factor of this game, however... the nice graphics, fun gameplay and impressive programming are what really shine here. The humor is always fairly sharp in every situation, and the whole thing has the feel of an animated cartoon. \r\n\r\nThe graphics are excellent, with bright colors and lots of little details, a welcome change from the overblended graphics of today. The music is nicely done, with a trademark Snake Brother theme, and several well-done melodies. The programming is simply amazing, with lots of falling trees, axes, and a great sword-style combat engine. The boss fights are all impressively done, and not just simple \'shoot the insanely fast little smiley who shoots stars\' types. I gaped when I first saw the crocodile with an animated tail, and was impressed with the timing and precision it required to take him down with a series of ricochets. \r\n\r\nAs it stands, I have still not finished this game.

Thanx. ^_^<br><br>The second zzt.archive Game of the Month of 1999 will be the Buck Russel Demo by Almighty Cow. Surprisingly this game has never before been the Game of the Month, so I chose it now. Buck Russel is, in case you don\'t know (which I doubt), about a cop from the 70s called... guess what... Buck Russel. He and his partner Stone are getting involved in drugs business and many more. So far for the very small plot summary.<br><br>Why did I choose this game? That\'s because, firstly, the graphics are brilliant, with everything worked out into detail. Of course, you can\'t judge a game on its graphics alone. What other features does the game have? The gameplay is the answer. While playing Buck Russel I really got involved with plot and the characters. The characters were worked out fine, too, which makes the game a lot more playable, too. Those guys reminded me of the characters from the PC game Interstate \'76. A lot of action will get you involved with the game as well, I\'m sure of that. However, there are some minor bugs in the game and one part in the dock may seem a little hard, but this just can\'t spoil the fun. I know the Cow hates PC speaker music himself (he once told me), so that explains the lack and quality of sound fx and music in the game.

This is actually the only ZZT game (with the exception of Blue Magus\' Blind Remix and Madguy\'s Wartorn) that is actually thrilling, exciting and even scary in a way.

Most of the graphics consist of the inside of the Gene Inc Research Labs. The inside-the-building graphics are simple, but still professionally done. There are a few cut scene graphics that look pretty good, too. Fishfood has used a lot of dark colors, which really add to the atmosphere of the game. Hmm, combining graphics with the atmosphere - very well done, again. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMost of the game\'s programming is simple. The only actual programming the game has is the RPG battle, which is nice, but nothing special. Still, it provides a good change of game play in this game that is mainly an interactive movie. <br><br>\r\n\r\nI kinda missed some good, scary music. Oh well. The sound effects were okay, though. =) The game had quite a lot of spelling errors, which might be a little disturbing. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOverall, Dark Soul is a very good game that you should definitely download. If the rest of the series is going to be as good as the first part this is certainly something you should look forward, too. I also was a beta-tester for this game and I guess I should hereby thank Fishfood for letting me test it.

I decided not to make Koopo the Lemming Game of the Month, because it was released by Hydra (Koopo never released it for some reason). I didn\'t know what Koopo would think of that, so I decided to make the other great sidescroller of this month GotM: Scooter! <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn Scooter, you control a small female guinea pig. She has to climb, move, dig, (etc...) her way to various levels. Not much of a plot, but for some reason, sidescroller never really have a developed plot. Most of the time, this doesn\'t matter really, since you\'ll probably have fun enough anyway. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe controls of Scooter may seem a little difficult when you first play the game, but you\'ll get used to them pretty soon. There are various buttons: switching directions, tunnelling, digging, producing a clump of dirt and jumping. Also, beware of the red exclamation mark button... the suicide button. =)<br><br>\r\n\r\nScooter is game that\'s rather doable, even though it still provides you with some good challenges. The game is similar to the ZZT hit Zem! (and Zem! 2, of course) and it also bears some minor resemblances to Koopo the Lemming. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe graphics of Scooter are pretty good, but not all that special. The decent graphics make the game look rather professional, which is a good thing, of course. You will also find a few art boards of our guinea pig friend herself, which looks pretty cool and funny. Scooter, you rule! =) <br><br>\r\n\r\nI haven\'t heard many people talking about the release of Scooter yet, so I hope this Game of the Month review will draw the attention of this Lame Game production, brought to us by gerbil, which is most likely to provide you with some good side scrolling fun.','','2000-04-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(70,'Game of the Month Review: Last Momentum','Hydra','Featured Game','The year is 3955 and speedracing is the most popular form of entertainment on earth. NIL and WIRE are two companies who are both into the building of racing ships. You are Trent Carwell, son of a WIRE-employee. Adolfus Speede, 83-year old head of NIL, has now only goal left: to put WIRE out of business! He has challenged WIRE to a momemtum-speeder race. The pilot is to survive some of NIL\'s most dangerous tracks. And gues... that pilot is you. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThis game can be called a racing-game, I guess, but it is very different from games such as Speed Racer X (EdC) or Rush (Shyam Natarajan). The player controls a cart which can only move left or right. The goal is to avoid obstacles which move towards you. When the timer reaches zero, you have completed the track. Yet, you also have a \"momentum\" meter (score). This decreases automatically while racing, and when hit, it decreases even more! When it reaches zero, you\'ll die. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe game is built up of different \"zones\": atmosphere, forest, volcano, and later on also cybercity. Each zone contains five tracks and an ending boss. As you progress along the tracks of a zone, they get more and more difficult; you\'ll encounter more obstacles, and it takes longer before the timer reaches zero. By winning money, you can also use bonuses to get extra momentum.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLast Momemtum is a pretty original game. I believe it\'s the first of its kind; though this \"avoid-by-moving-left-and-right\" engine has been used *many* times before, no full game was based on it yet. The difficulty of the game is between easy and hard; the first few levels of a zone are way easy, but the last level and the boss can take a couple tries. The graphics of the game itself are rather simple, but decent, and the graphics of the intros and cutscenes are really beautiful (Hey, we\'re talking about CoolZx here!). Overall I can only say that this game belongs in your collection! ','','2000-05-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(71,'Game of the Month Review: Life of a Player 2','Hydra','Featured Game','IMO only two quite cool ZZT games were released this month. The first one is Rolie, by a new ZZTer Lil\' Peebrain. The second one is the sequel to Life of a Player by RingWorm and Oddjob. My choice for the Game of the Month fell on the latter. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLife of a Player 2 starts when Romeo, the \"hero\" of the game is invited to a millenium party in Mexico. After this a lot of things go wrong, as you would have probably expected :). Romeo will need all of his player skills to save himself from a lot of painful situations. This time, there\'s also some mini-games included in the game, of which my favorite is absolutely the barkeeper-game; in this game you\'ll need to mix a lot of drinks, and this is a nice test for your knowledge of alcoholic cocktails :). <br><br>\r\n\r\nThis game\'s strongest point is obviously the humor. Tons of little jokes and funny situations are tucked in. Some of them (those jokes about Mexico) I didn\'t really understand though, but you probably need to be an American to do understand them (But hey, a lot of the jokes in games by Hercules and me no-one understand and can understand either :). The player battles, a parody on the scot-battles in Life of a Scotter are really cool too, though it\'s a shame there are only two of them.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLife of a Player, originally meant as a parody on Life of a Scotter by Hercules and me has grown to be far more than just a rip-off as stated on the title screen. The really funny humor, nice graphics and player battles make this one a perfect Game of the Month! ','','2000-06-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(72,'Game of the Month Review: A Dwarvish Mead Dream','Hydra','Featured Game','A lot of people have probably played the demo of A Dwarvish Mead Dream, which did well in the IF Annual ZZT Excellence Awards and the Hoodian Awards in 1999. Finally, the game is complete and it\'s a big shiny gem, indeed. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThere were two worlds... the dreamworld and reality. One day, long ago, reality attacked dreamworld, slaughtering its peaceful inhabitants. One of the few survivors was Radux the Dwarf, the guardian of the dreamworld. He seeks for help in reality... <br><br>\r\n\r\nYou are Glenn, a young Dwarf. One day, you come upon a small tavern. A Dwarf clad in red beckons you. You sit and he offers you a goblet of mead. Then you drift away into a dream... you end up in the dreamworld. It appears that you are a dream, just like Radux. The difference between you and him is that he was born in the dreamworld and you were not. You can freely travel between reality and the dreamworld. This is where the action-packed adveture starts. <br><br>\r\n\r\nA Dwarvish Mead Dream is an RPG with several types of gameplay. A very important part of it, is the dungeon- exploring. Fans of dungeon-games are most likely to love this game, if only for that part. Other parts of the game include a spiffy battle-engine, other cool engines and normal RPG-ish parts. <br><br>\r\n\r\nADMD features very good graphics, as we pretty much have come to expect from coolzx, the winner of the Summer 2000 IF24AHOZ contest. It\'s the combination of kick-ass graphics and a wide variety in gameplay what makes this game a shining pearl and very, very fine experience. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, A Dwarvish Mead Dream is coolzx\'s best game released so far. And yes, he has released quite a lot of \'em (and good ones, too :D). I\'d like to compliment coolzx on this great game. For those you who haven\'t tried it out yet, I recommend you to do so. ','','2000-07-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(73,'Game of the Month Review: LOME: The Legend of Matt','Knightt','Featured Game','RPG/Adventures seem to be the most common game style. Ever since the success of bongo\'s masterpiece, Rhygar, many have tried to follow, and no one has yet made a game of the genre as great. L.O.M.E. doesn\'t quite match that classic, but it\'s a breath of fresh air to a suffocating ZZT community.<br> <br>\r\n\r\nL.O.M.E. starts out as a plot about a mysterious jewel of great power and a young adventurer, stranded on an island, seeking the father who he had never met. The storyline throws some info at the player as the quest begins and then seems to slow down a bit, as traveling the island becomes a major portion of the pie. The battle system is somewhat flawed, yes, because the player can run away from enemies without the fight meter restarting (a countdown using the \"gems\" label), but to buy things in the game, score must be obtained from defeated enemies, so there\'s basically no choice but to have a few battles. Not too much fanciness; pre-programmed enemies will leap out at the player at the count of 0, but not too many, nor too little. The gameplay is all about exploration; roaming the land for secrets, or just the freedom of journeying (while some areas in the game do require the player to finish certain tasks before accessing). Therefore, L.O.M.E. also gives non-textual reasons to venture the game through. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOkay, okay, the graphics aren\'t GREAT. The visuals are fine, yeah, but not exactly beautiful. Still, it\'s not tedious to tell what things are, and no parts of the game are worse than average, art-wise. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHe did everything himself. The music (which isn\'t bad), the graphics, the story-telling, hell, the ENTIRE ZZT WORLD, minus the STK toolkits used. Just two bits of advice; try to understand the plot from the start to the surprising and amazingly-done finish, and don\'t let Leamas\'s lack of good English harm the enjoyment. Thanks for helping the community, Sejr. ','','2000-08-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(74,'Game of the Month Review: Rup Pig','Hercules','Featured Game','Only few good games have been released this month. In my opinion, the only good ones were Tut\'s Tombs Legends Disc 2 (by Ringworm), Possessed (by Jojoisjo) and Rup Pig (by Mrs Claus). My choice fell on Rup Pig, a strangely compelling story of a half human, half pig, called Rup. <br><br>\r\n\r\nRup was born in a big hospital in Boston, where he surprised both the doctors and his mother. What the heck was *that*? Rup Pig\'s mother died the day after. At the age of 9, Rup Pig moved to a small town in Maine, called Unity. His only friend was a girl named Sally Dort. When Sally and Rup Pig escaped from school and went onto a train, Sally accidentally fell out of the train. From this moment, Rup Pig\'s weird adventures start... <br><br>\r\n\r\nMrs Claus did extremely well in the IF 24 artistic hours of ZZT and his graphical talent is shown in this game. The entire game features lush graphics and artwork, with the exception of one intentionally newbie-ish-made board (which he should have left out, in my opinion). Some of the colouring is pretty amazing, too. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAs for gameplay, Rup Pig offers some enemy-battling, one little mini-game and some item-hunting. The sound effects and music of the game are alright, but nothing really special. The length of the game is a definite plus - it\'s quite a lot of boards and it\'s 214k. <br><br>\r\n\r\nRup Pig focuses on a strange sense of humor, a sense of humor that I\'d almost call \"DirrCo humor\". It features some dirty jokes and just random funny stuff. You may not find everything amusing, but I\'m pretty sure you\'ll find at least some parts amusing. The game itself makes little sense, which only adds to the humor part, but it makes enough sense to be understood. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOveral, Rup Pig is a nifty game that has a few shortcomings, but a lot of good points, too. It\'s certainly worth the download.

This year, he surprised us with good games like Bloodlines, Operation: Obrian, and now disc one of New Earth Operations. Other candidates for this month\'s GOTM were Gems and Pipes by Jojoisjo and Psyche by Zenith. Before I explain why my choise fell on NEO, I\'ll give you a short summary of the plot of this game... <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the 21th century, more and more research goes in the manipulating of genes. The USA founds the GRD (Genetic Research and Development). Other countries founded similar organisations. Among them was China, of which their organisation found a cure for AIDS... This quickly made China the most powerful country in the world. The USA fell into a long recession. To enlarge to market in the hope of fixing this, they combined several cities into one large Macropolis; the New Earth Operations (N.E.O.) bill. The USA became the genetic capitol of the world again. A special forced unit called the G.E.C. was created to prevent the USA from the rebelling forces in Russia. Later on, the E.R.G. was formed by an Asian company. This company could equal the strength of the G.E.C... This game tells the two different stories of two diffent people; a G.E.C. soldier called Ace, and a man who is captive of the E.R.G. called Blade. To be honest, I don\'t really get the plot of he part with Blade, but that\'s probably since this is only disc 1 of the game... <br><br>\r\n\r\nAN.E.O. Disc 1 is actually a relatively short game; both the storylines have only 5 playable boards in it. Both they have a different way of playing; Blade\'s part is a side-scroller, while Ace\'s part centers around action (shooting soldiers).<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat makes N.E.O. a really awesome game is it\'s atmosphere. Chase has managed to make a richly detailed setting for this game, with which he proves to be a great plot-writer. The graphics are also good, they fit perfectly with the game. The only thing which is a shame about the entire game is that it is a little easy (except for the 3D shoot-out board in Ace\'s part), and can be completed in a quite short time. Other than that, this is a kicking game, and a recommendation for anybody to download.

Only few games were released this month (most of the recently uploaded games have been finished in September) and ChickenWire v1.5 was in my opinion the best of this month\'s few releases. <br><br>\r\n\r\nChickenWire v1.5 is, as you could have guessed from the game\'s title, an update of the original released quite a long time ago. I already enjoyed the original, but the update has several neat improvements. <br><br>\r\n\r\nZenith himself describes this game as the Rangest of ZZT (Rangest being a MegaZeux game by Darren Hewer). The game also resembles Darkness (another MegaZeux game by Darren Hewer). If you haven\'t played any of the mentioned MZX titles; this game is a seemingly incoherent bunch of very odd, yet intriguing boards linked together. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIf it\'s incoherent, then why is it a good game? Well, this game wasn\'t meant to be coherent in any way. Coherence is of no importance in this piece of silly Zenith humor. The game is full of references (a lot of them being ZZT community references) and several of them require some involvement in the scene to understand them. If you aren\'t really involved in the scene, the jokes are probably not as funny to you, but if you get what is being said, this game can be damned hilarious at some points. <br><br>\r\n\r\nChickenWire doesn\'t feature much graphics, but what\'s there looks really good. It also has a few nifty tunes by Viovis. As for programming: ChickenWire features some tricks used in all sorts of random ways. The main part of this game is, of course, the silly humor and random things spread around the small ZZT world. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you are up for some good laughter and enjoy a good bit of weird humor, then download this game. If, however, you are looking for a serious and coherent game, you got the wrong thing here. Anyway, thumbs up for this cool update of ChickenWire, released under Lame Game. ','','2000-11-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(77,'Game of the Month Review: Voyage of Four','Hydra','Featured Game','This month, a couple of really good ZZT games have actually been released. Chronos presented the 13th chapter of the Chrono Wars saga, Eurakarte made the small puzzle game \"Mr Shapiro cares not for Snakes\", MeBo and I finished the sequel to King\'s Quest ZZT and WiL finished his interactive movie/RPG Voyage of Four. My choice for the GOTM fell on the last game. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Voyage of Four deals with the actions of four characters and the worlds they inhabit. I will not give away more about it; the storyline in this game is awesome, and you should play the game yourself to see it. In the user reviews of this game, it was said (most noticeably by Lemmer) that this game\'s storyline was ripped off Final Fantasy. Well, I don\'t agree with that. Maybe some elements in the beginning resemble FF; but the rest of the game certainly doesn\'t. Instead, WiL has made a really thrilling plot, filled with subplots, and the characters in his game actually are actually profound; my personal attempts at doing such a thing have always been in vain (Sacrifice, Forbidden Tolerance). <br><br>\r\n\r\nLike said before Voyage of Four is an interactive movie. And that\'s precisely the fact which leaves me musing about how truly perfect the game could have been... Now the whole game is over in 1.5 ZZT files... Imagine a long epic RPG spreading multiple chapters with this game\'s storyline... What I\'m saying is this; if this game would have been a normal ZZT game (in which the player actually can do things) instead of a movie, it could have been the next Rhygar! Oh well, guess I\'ve never been a real interactive movie-lover like some other ZZTers :). <br><br>\r\n\r\nSome RPG battles were also tucked in; they are nice, even though sometimes they can be a little bit tedious (djinn battle). Last, but certainly not least, Voyage of Four has some awesome music (which I\'ve come to expect from the creator of #play) and ditto graphics/visual effects. Overall, I think WiL\'s first serious ZZT game is a damn great one, and I\'m looking forward to his future games. Keep up the good work!

However, there have been a few good releases among them. Most noticeably \"Driving\" (by Slamice), \"Donny\'s Little Feast\" (by Tony C), \"Who Wants to be on a Gameshow Demo\" (by BroKen) and of course, \"New Demo\" (by Bucket) which won the contest this month.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Who Wants to be on a Gameshow Demo\" is a neat little game, but I feel it wasn\'t that special to win GOTM and \"Driving\" is definitely a fun game, but it\'s not that original as you might think it is and I personally got bored of it after a few boards. \"Donny\'s Little Feast\" is an enjoyable oldskool ZZT game with classic action and adventure. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"New Demo\" closely resembles Draco\'s ZZT style, both in art as in the dialogues. Bucket has obviously been inspired by the author of the Teen Priest series, and I can\'t say it turned out bad.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBucket has apparent artistical talents and is especially good at drawing people in ZZT, as this game shows. The in-game graphics are good, although nothing too special.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs for the story, it\'s rather random and somewhat crazy. You\'ll notice as you play along. Maybe it\'s the randomness that makes it enjoyable. Okay, this concept has been done before, but it proves to at least somewhat humorous.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAlas, this game has its down-sides as well. It\'s a demo and has not been beta-tested well. It\'s still rather buggy and has some annoying passage-linking errors.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOverall, I do suggest checking this game out, if you liked games like the Teen Priest series, Edible Vomit, and Rup Pig. Don\'t expect anything truly amazing, though, since this game may be promising, but it\'s not as great as it could have been.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe\'ve seen some good games this month, but nothing oustanding, so let\'s hope next month will have some great releases.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs for \"New Demo\", I have two more things to say. \"SNAGGIT!\" and watch out for bucket, as he showed he has promising ZZT skills.','','2001-03-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(79,'Game of the Month Review: Within v1.9','Hydra','Featured Game','Well, even though lots of nice ZZT games have been released this month (Stupid RPG Disc 2 SSCE, Spork Man 2 Demo, Regeneer Caverns, Within v1.9, Stupid RPG Third Flavor Demo, just to name a few), they were all either demos or remakes, which means no actually new and cool full games have been released... The only exception were a couple of random dungeon games, but to be honest, I\'m getting a bit tired of those games (as long as they don\'t bring something new, like Run-on did last month). I was doubting for quite some time which game had to become GOTM; should it be the Stupid RPG Third Flavor Demo or Within v1.9? My choice fell on the latter, even though I normally never make remakes GOTM...<br><br>\r\n\r\nWithin, made by Wayward, is a game which was originally made during the Fall 24 hours of ZZT of 1999 (of which the topic was fantasy). Personally I think that neither I, nor the judges back then, gave this game the score that it deserved. Now, a completely spiffed up version has been released... <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe plot/storyline is what really matters in this game. The story deals with Thomas, a typical day-dreamer, and his friends Alicia and Thomas. The storyline gives you the \'Matrix-feeling\'; while playing you\'re constantly doubting if what you\'re seeing is \'real\' or not. I\'m not giving away more details about the storyline here, because that would really ruin the fun. You should just play it for yourself, believe me, you\'ll like it! The only thing I don\'t like, and would have done otherwise if I had made the game, is the ending... I can\'t explain why, because that would mean giving away too much of the plot, but anybody who wants to know, feel free to mail me (click on my name below to send mail).<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis game has (not counting the simply horrible-looking title screen) some really great graphics, which was what the original 24HoZ game lacked... As said before the storyline is awesome, and overall it\'s just a generally cool game to play. It is, however, a game that the die-hard action fans probably won\'t like, since playing mostly comes down to reading long dialogs... Overall, I can only recommend you to check this one out! <br><br>','','2001-02-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(80,'Game of the Month Review: Run-On','Hydra','Featured Game','For the second time in a row the game of the month goes out to WiL; the ZZTer who is probably going to proclaim the title \'ZZTer of the year 2000\'. Not too many good games were released this month. The only really high qualty ones were, in my opinion, Robert Pragt\'s \"Interstellar Police\" and the game we are talking about here: \"Run-on\". Let\'s hope 2001 will bring us more good ZZT games!<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe storyline behind Run-on is actually kind of trivial: You assume the role of a guy who is hanging around in his yard, when suddenly he is filled with fear. A great darkness has overtaken this world, and is now chasing you. When it\'ll reach you, you are dead meat, so you only know one thing to do: to run, and to keep running on. Darkness is simulated in the game by the left wall of the screen. At the right wall of the screen, terrain is generated, so that you get the feeling that the screen \'scrolls\' towards the right. <br><br>\r\n\r\nRun-on is a game in the genre that has its origin in this year: randomly generated games. It all started when LowerVP released the first episode of the game \'Dungeon Guru Nostalgia\', somewhere during the first months of the year I believe. LowerVP and various others like CoolZx have been releasing randomly generated dungeon-games since then. Personally, I think WiL\'s contribution to the genre is a damn great one, possibly even the best. What makes Run-on so great is that it actually takes a really long time before it starts to get boring. Other random games tend to bore relatively quickly. (A good example, sorry CoolZx, is the 24HoZ game \'The Pits of Pythor - this one takes you through 30(!) more or less identical levels). Run-on, on the other hand, offers variation to the player. It offers four types of worlds, each with their own type of play: regular run-to-the-right, dark boards, boards scrolling in 4 directions and even a randomly generated side-scroller are challenges you will be offered... This all shows that next to being a damn good musician, WiL is a damn good programmer too. <br><br>\r\n\r\nEven though it is fun to play, Run-on is not a game to play in one afternoon. It\'s just way too long for that. The thing which is best to do is to play this game for a while, then save it, and continue later on... This way you actually have a game which is enjoyable for a couple of days!<br><br>\r\n\r\nLast, and in this case probably least too; the graphics of this game are pretty nice. Graphics are an issue that most random games greatly lack in and of course the randomly generated terrain itself cannot be made really beatiful, but the rest of the screen is often forgotten... not in WiL\'s game luckily. Overall, I really think that you should take a look at this masterpiece of programming. ','','2001-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(81,'Game of the Month Review: Los Refritos 9','Hercules','Featured Game','March 2001 was mainly dominated by three big ZZT releasals, those being \"Deceiving Guidance\" (by me and Hydra), \"Purposedly Produced Dynamic Visualties II\" (by Viovis) and \"Los Refritos 9\" (by Chuck). Easy enough -- I cannot make my own game GOTM. =) However, the race between PPDVII and Los Refritos 9 was a close one and my choice fell on LR9, by Chuck. Before starting the real review on LR9, I\'d like to congratulate Viovis on his piece of ZZT art, PPDVII. Well, let\'s proceed to the review.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLos Refritos is Chuck\'s well-known ZZT series about the ZZT scene and that\'s mainly the IRC (Internet Relay Chat -- see www.mirc.com for info) ZZT scene. Chuck released part 1-8 a while ago and they never were a big success, although they were still decent. Los Refritos 9, however, is different. And different means better, here. LR9 turned out to be a game that was well-received by the community. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile part 1-8 were mainly cinemas about arguements and events in the IRC ZZT scene, part 9 offers a coherent plot along with it. This makes it more worthwhile and playable for ZZTers who do not know much about the scene itself, unlike the previous parts in the series.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI won\'t reveal much of the plot here, as it\'d spoil the fun (mainly because the game consists of cinemas for a large part). What you can expect is an appearance of people like Blazer, Tseng, Lemmer, FishFood, Chuck, Zamros, Master Walnut and more. They\'re all back. You\'ll venture into the worlds of the IRC servers Austnet and Espernet, with channels like #darkdigital, #sledgehammer, #loungeact and #asd.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPeople who know the ZZT scene well and have met most of (or all of) the people in LR9 are most likely to find this game much more enjoyable than others. I\'m not saying you won\'t like it if you\'re not involved in the scene, but if you understand what some things are about, the game is most likely to appeal a lot more to you.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs for graphics, LR9 offers you decent visuals done by Chuck and Blazer. The game is using a font (which, by the way, I was never too fond of, but that doesn\'t really matter), too. You won\'t find outstanding graphics, but they are definitely not bad.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs far as gameplay goes, the game offers quite some variation, which the previous LR episodes lacked. The variation includes cinemas, playable boards, action boards, battles and puzzles. An enjoyable mix, though the action boards where you have to shoot enemies are a bit tedious.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOverall, LR9 is longer than the older episodes, offers a wider variety in gameplay, has less pointless newbie-bashing, has a neat plot and is defintely the shining gem of the series so far. Some of the scene-references are funny, deep and sugar- sweet and the 3rd file (the aftermath) is excellent.

My choice fell on the latter. Stupid RPG, even though it is a remake (and people must know my attitude to remakes by now :), is a really good game which really \"adds\" something to the original game, and therefore deserves a honorable mention here before I start with the actual review of Four.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFour, made by Jojoisjo - who I consider one of the most talented members of Lame Game - is a game I\'ve never seen before in ZZT. The storyline of the whole game is wrapped in mist - In the beginning you get the feeling that there isn\'t a story at all, but gradually you begin to disover what\'s happening, the entire thing stays unclear till the end, though.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLike I said before I\'ve never seen this type of game done in ZZT. Then, what kind of game is this? Well, this is an adventure game, only totally different from most adventure games; This is a first person game. Not like the (mostly not too-good) 3D games we\'ve seen - but more like old PC games like Sierra\'s \"Rise of the Dragon\". Every screen is a different location where several things can be done - looking at things, using items, etc... This is all controlled by a cursor, moved around by using the keyboard as usual, but (and that\'s also something new!) after some practice it works even better when using the mouse (and the speed set a bit faster). The entire game is very much item-based - that means a lot of picking up/using items. All items which the player has in position are shown in the right half of the screen, a handy feature because the \"?+i\"-typing in the usual adventure to see your inventory can get really annoying. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe graphics of the scenes in the game are a bit on the mediocre side, I must say. I\'m personally not too happy with the fact that the screen looks so dark too. Some improvements of the graphics wouldn\'t be uncoming in this game\'s planned sequel. There\'s also not too much music, which is too bad because Jojo is really good at composing. Aside from these two flaws, Four makes a really great game. The originality and gameplay have made this one a competor for game of the year. So everybody, download it if you haven\'t already!

The biggest game of the three, \"Today is Monday\" won.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis game has a big history, as voighdt explains in the accompanying text file. It all started back in 1998 and voighdt was thinking on an amusing joke concept that he called \"Today is Monday\" -- a small, weird game to be released on let\'s say, thursday. However, voighdt figured it would be a better idea to not let it be another Red Aureole joke game (Bomb ZZT, anyone?) and make this into a big, real game.<br><br>\r\n\r\n4 was supposed to be part of a trilogy, which also included \"k.r.l.f.n.t.e.\" and \"Around the World in Seven Days\". voighdt now indeed this game to be a mix of adventure, humor and mystery. A lot more happened in this game\'s history and at some point, it was supposed to be a joint-project with Viovis. However, this never really worked out and work was abandoned. In the year 2000, voighdt thought that he needed to release some of the stuff he worked on for the past few years and started working on this game again, this time only focussing on the first day, monday. Having done some research on the origins of the week-days, monday had to do something with \"moon\". \"Today is Monday\" now contained spiced up parts from the original \"Today is Monday\" (which was abandoned), \"k.r.l.f.n.t.e.\" and \"SiK 2\" (abandoned project by voighdt and Viovis). In May 2001, it first saw daylight.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe game starts out with amazingly intriguing piece of text. I quote some of it: \"today was your 1st day alive and your last day to die. monday was the day i never knew you.\" and \"dead like a monday. dead like today\". The full text definitely sets the mood.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis game is mainly based on interesting, mysterious writing and artistical concepts. Viovis\' influence in voighdt is clearly noticeable, especially in the art-only boards. The game has a mysterious, moody tone, but comic relief there is a plenty.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe graphics of this game are quite okay and sometimes rather trippy in a Viovis-kind of way. voighdt shows he has definite talent and the only thing that bugged me here were the board linking errors.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis game is interesting enough and even if you\'re not a fan of this style, you might want to check it out just for the heck of it.

June 2001. Many have viewed this month as thin and disappointing (especially since some popular releases were due this month, such as a new game by Wayward, one by the old and current IF groups, and something by myself), but 25 people cared enough to vote on what became the Top 3 candidates for GotM in June 2001... in third place was Viovis\'s \"The Motivational Speaker\", a fun, storytelling game (like usual Viovis style) about... well... a motivational speaker. Somewhat short, but fun enough. Second was bucket\'s (March 2001 GotM winner, with \"New Demo\") \"Resident Evil\", a game that would\'ve made a fantastic demo, but served as a decent complete game. RE takes the virus/zombie aspects of the popular game series and transfers it to ZZT, with great graphics and fairly good gameplay, but was annoying at times (ammo reloading, zombies taking away too much health).<br><br>\r\n\r\nAlso, I\'d like to point out \"The Kane Project 2\", which got 2 votes... of course, Master Raze (the author) isn\'t the most popular of programmers, and there was little hype from anywhere about the game from himself, so he has something to be proud of. A little too much cursing there, m\' friend, but it got the votes it deserved anyway... once again proving that if a game is truly good, it will prevail. <br><br>\r\n\r\n... But, hey, enough with that. Let\'s get on to this month\'s winner (which I would\'ve picked myself, just like last month\'s; rock on, community!)... _God_\'s \"NO!\"!<br><br>\r\n\r\n_God_ has had several releases in the past, but the most impressive one was \"RPG Demo\", which got him into Random Inc. I was pretty happy with what I got, there, but then he sent me a copy of \"NO!\", with the first few levels done... and I knew I was getting a programmer with the potential of being one of the top 15 around. \"NO!\" blends traditional ZZT arena fighting, RPG battling (and this engine\'s actually GOOD, folks... plenty of magic attacks, as well as a sword technique and a bomb move), Atari\'s Breakout (much like pong, with the major difference being that instead of going against an opponent, the player has to hit differently colored blocks), and the random dungeon scheme... and somehow manages to make it all fun. Eight levels of fun, plus a boss at the end which won\'t fall by touching him (... or it) many times or trying to shoot his brains out (... Well, he\'ll tell you how to defeat him, but it\'s still somewhat challenging and fun anyway). The only real downfalls are that it\'s a bit short (which is forgiven, since it\'s fun enough to be replayed a decent number of times), plus it has some bugs that sometimes appear, though the most I had to do about that was try \"?+dark\" to find a passage. Don\'t worry about it, folks, the small errors don\'t really harm the game.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAre there some bugs? Yeah. Should you care? No, dammit, just use \"+zap\". This is one of the better games of the year, and the best action game released so far this year (okay, there\'s little choice for that second one... but this game\'s good, anyway!). Let\'s remember why people play ZZT; to have fun. Simple as that. And this game, while being as simple as that, also does pack that fun. ','','2001-07-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(85,'Game of the Month Review: Stupid RPG: Third Flavor','Wayward','Featured Game','July is almost always the month where zzters finally get in gear and release some really good games. This month was no exception. That being said, some notable releases include the very surreal Red Isle by Oof, the widely popular ZZT Sports by Fishfood, and two long awaited titles by two very well established zzters, Operation: Obrian 2 by Chase Bramlage and Stupid RPG: Third Flavor by Knightt.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile all of these games were good in their own right, be it through humor or graphics or music or whatnot, none of the games released this month can touch Stupid RPG: Third Flavor. This is due to the fact that the game has all of these qualities, and delivers them in an incredibly well-wrapped package. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThough the story of the game isn\'t as well written as other games in the series, Knightt sets out to entertain the reader, and he does a very fine job of this. I found myself laughing from the very beginning, as the little Metroid spoof really had nothing to do with the game, but set the mood incredibly well. The comedy contines to spew from almost everything you touch, and it is everything you expect to hear from knightt. Yes, the misadventures of Jed, Razor, and Fagnuts may use many of the same jokes that we have heard from other Stupid RPG games and from the ZZT community in general, but it is still very funny.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOutside of one or two boards that made me wince and made my eyes want to vomit, the graphics in this game are solid, and give a nice complimentary atmosphere for the comedic tone of the game.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe music, written by JacobH, is beautiful. It is truly one of my favorite zzt musical scores of all time, right up there with Freedom and Business Bob Update in my book. Knightt does a very good job of putting the right piece of music in the right place, though the music played after killing enemies makes me want to destroy my PC Speaker, but that\'s just me :)<br><br>\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is definitely one of the best games this year. It combines many little elements that are much harder to get right than one might think to make an outstanding zzt experience. This game will not please everyone; no game ever will, but it is certainly well worth the download. ','','2001-08-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(86,'Game of the Month Review: Anthropoid','Knightt','Featured Game','Ah... August usually isn\'t a kind month for ZZT, and, as usual, there were some decent games released, but for the most part there was little to talk about. Having just returned from vacation and unconvinced that a game this month deserved a GotM, Hercules approved to let me decide this month\'s honors. We did, however, seem to agree that this month\'s best games were Nuero\'s \"Anthropoid\" and Dsone\'s \"Lemming Hunter\" Demo.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI was rather impressed with \"Lemming Hunter\", but since I feel it\'s better to reward a complete game than a demo, and because they both had roughly the same level of quality (however, Nuero\'s game offered more of it), my choice was with \"Anthropoid\". \"Lemming Hunter\" continues the trend of lemmings-esque (C\'mon, you know those cute lil\' guys that remind me of the Kennedy family) ZZT efforts, and does it quite well... while some may say it\'s \"no-frills\", the programming is done well in my view, and will entertain some (as I was). <br><br>\r\n\r\nNow, we go to \"Anthropoid\". A three file game of the Adventure/RPG genre, Anthro mixes good, easy humor with enemy types similiar in name to Pokemon\'s (\"Rainer\", \"Lava Flamer\", \"Thunderator\")... and the journeying of the game feels somewhat like Pokemon, as well. Of course, the difference between Anthro and Pokemon is that Pokemon\'s way overrated and it sucks (... we already knew that, right?); Anthro\'s good, though it may not be a classic (thanks to varying game environments and a storyline that gradually picks up). <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe problem with this game is that the third file is way repetitive and is filled with bugs; however, at the same time, it has an amusing enough plot to keep it enjoyable. Not everyone will be impressed (though I was), but it\'s the best option August has brought us.

So I, Kracken, am here instead as his cheap replacement for this month\'s dealings.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTwo muchly worthy mentions this month would have to be Infestation 3 by the illustrious Coolzx and Mazi-Oog by the beauteous WiL; two games of high standard that would have, with little doubt, probably won the award in lesser GotM\'ing months. I3 features 20+ rounds of gun-toting action with some of the most adorably drawn bloodthirsty monsters I\'ve ever seen; Coolzx\'s graphical ability is awesome. Mazi-Oog is a intriguing game belonging to a hybridized genre of action, puzzle and strategy; and while being one of the most user-friendly ZZT\'ing games I\'ve seen to date (the helpfile is most shiny), also successfully shows off WiL\'s formidable abilities in programming and in making an entertaining game.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut enough of that.\r\nWhat I am reviewing today folks, is GotM and Tseng\'s (possibly) final ZZT game, The Misadventures of Mega Job: The Epic Tag Team, which I shall henceforth refer to as \'Mega-job\' for simplicity\'s sake. Mega-job, which I also had the fortune of beta-testing, could be called a game about the finer things in life; but is mostly a tale about 2 oddball part time wrestler crime-fighters residing in the corruption-filled pandemonium of Beefville. The plotline entails the? well, the Misadventures of El Janito: The Mexican Stereotype, who is quite small and Beef the slightly annoyed, who is slightly annoyed. El Janito has powers of summon, and can call upon many illegal immigrants to hurt stuff on his behalf in dire circumstance, whilst Beef wields the formidable powers of instant Spam fabrication. Yellow/Red and Blue spandex respectively, of course. <br><br>\r\n\r\nEnlisted to the scene by the effervescent pyrotechnical goddess of wrestling, they start out their careers in the decrepit warehouse that is the Job Cave, an area that serves as a figurative pit stop for the rest of the game. You play the game as Beef and soon find out that all major gangs in the vicinity have erupted into violence and that the mayor\'s daughter, Libby the helpless gal, has also been kidnapped. With this, the mismatched heroes spring into the fray, and from here you must deal with the SSKKKM, Muslim Mafia, Average Pink Band and the Dark Order of Earls before you can rescue Beef\'s stalkee- erm, beloved.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe game is mainly action-based, but also has boss mini-games and elements of \'lock and key\' puzzles woven throughout it. Between scenarios, Mega Job makes use of a cunning City Map engine to navigate. Aside from its above average graphics (come now, they aren\'t THAT bad, Tseng), what stands out about Mega Job is its stunning game play. Not only are the mini-games and general action within the game entertaining, but the game is also quite amusing, as its intention and perhaps most of all, notably fulfills its quota of hysterical people running around. In other words, Mega Job succeeds because it\'s not only a fun game, but also because Tseng is quite an amusing bastard.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs aforementioned, this is also possibly Tseng\'s last ZZT game <i>(yeah, but he\'s been saying that for the past four games - Funk)</i>; which gives you even more reason to play it, for you may never see a game of this uniqueness and quality ever again. It\'s more than a worthy download, and I think I speak for many of us when I say that I am saddened if it is indeed his final game.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt is my advice that you download and play it, or teeth shall be gnashed at my end. Yes, that is a threat! ','','2001-10-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(88,'Game of the Month Review: Thief 3','Funk','Featured Game','Sadly, this review has been corrupted.

The completed version of WiL\'s final game, Pipeline 99, was probably a better reason out of many poorer excuses for why I took my sweet time writing GOTM - (must-play-one-more-level) - I mean; in taking the simple idea of getting a ball into a cup, WiL makes use of an innovative point-and-click engine interface to create a unique puzzle game, which was as challenging as it was inescapably addictive.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWarriors of Seven, a Random Incorporated release, is yet another to receive praises this month. As the first in a series of serious-minded RPGs by Knightt, it sets the atmosphere of the game quite well, weaving a suspenseful plot in the introduction of memorable characters, and whetting an anticipation for what is to come in the next game. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOf course, there can only be one winner. Through the conductance of various needless tests on animals in a cold, dank and smelly laboratory, scientists found that the results invariably correlated with Zanno\'s sci-fi adventure \'Nothing Constructive\'. Generally speaking, I don\'t really like Sci-Fi games; but Nothing Constructive effectively tossed most of my preconceptions from the 3032nd floor window and onto the superfluously rich citizens below. Serves them right, really.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOne of the more remarkable features of the game is the storyline; budding authors take note, it\'s definitely one of the most exceptionally written ZZT games I\'ve played. Permission to lapse into an English essay here. The storyline is non- linear and used to great effect in creating suspense and atmosphere, as narrative within the game generally forebodes ensuing events. Upon starting the game, the player is greeted with an introduction that is actually an epilogue in disguise, depicting the consequences of the adventure that is to follow. The characterisation is second-to-none; from Doctor Steve, a somewhat matrix-inspired persona, to Doom the enigmatic Chinese communist to Zanno himself, the characters are unique and oddly multi-faceted, escaping the narrow one-dimension \'clich?\' character plane that many ZZT game characters seem to become entrapped in. Zanno\'s creation of believable, yet still entertaining and at times amusing, worlds (such as a crime-tainted and decadent Earth) provide a story-realistic backdrop; you could almost be there, if you sat close enough to the monitor. Mind you, I have dibs on the starting the next nuclear war if they declare Ebonics to be the universal language of Earth.<br><br>\r\n\r\nZanno makes an unorthodox decision to star in his own game; hence, his life is in your grimy talons as you weave him through streams of bullets and allow him to consume profuse amounts of hard liquor. The game starts Zanno in what looks like a painful situation. Punnily surrounded by Feds and Doom with violent weaponry, he recounts the tale leading up to his dire circumstance; this is where the game starts, with Zanno working menial tasks at the Intergalactic Postal service. Soon after taking out Morris the senselessly happy \"diligent assbolt :D\" with his shiny phase gun, a package arrives delivered by a Fed. The story spirals from this single event; in killing Morris, Zanno inadvertently causes a chain of unfortunate events that is touted as \'Nothing Constructive\'.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe difficulty level of \'Nothing Constructive\' is relatively high, in my dubious opinion. I found that one of the final boss duels proved nigh near impossible to win. Arguably, this only makes the game more satisfying to complete. The graphics in the game are pleasing to the eye and appropriate to setting, the usage of grids and metallic colour schemes adds a futuristic edge to the game. Zanno\'s attention to detail is fairly evident; being utterly anal, I liked various small touches to the game like the occasional sparkling star in the background and the flashing broken \'r\' on Ant\'s bar sign.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut pretentious drivel aside, it would be more than nothing constructive if you miss out on playing this excellent game. Indeed, Chronos has a worthy contender to his throne of Sci-fi delights. <br><br>','','2001-12-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(90,'Game of the Month Review: Little Square Things','Nadir','Featured Game','[Sadly, this review was corrupted... -And it still is, for it tainted by Nadir\'s wretchedness! Uhh, I mean enjoy. - Kracken] <br><br>\r\n\r\nDecember, understandably, is a notoriously slow month for games, while our protagonists molest their turkeys and put little flashing lights into trees to frighten animals and small children. As well as craNKGod\'s Little Square Thingies, the selected GOTM, honourable mentions should go out to Wayward for Apud Le Medius Res, both a community game and a tribute to a friend of his, and Parallel by Boonob and MadTom, which was released in November but got nudged to be elligible for GOTM nomination in December- a novel idea in which the two authors alternate making boards for the game in a random plot fashion with no continuity, but which still came together in a big ball of love juice. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut I digress from the main feature of this sordid piece of writing! Now, I know the more cynical among you will correlate the release of Little Square Thingies, the creation of Z2 and the fact that craNKGod has had a major part to play in its creation. That, of course, is crap. FRANKLY CRANK WOULDNT HAVE GOT GOTM IF WE HADNT HAD SUCH A POOR MONTH FOR GAMES =(((( (yes, I am kidding.). The basic premise of LST is that of a puzzle game; sure, there\'s a plot involving you being in another dimension where you\'re a demi-god guiding the titular square thingies onto cyan tiles, which is superfluous but does actually add to the experience and gives the game a little purpose (TO BASH CRANKGOD\'S SKULL UNTIL HE BLEEDS) which it would otherwise be lacking. Different squares move in different ways; as well as normal squares that move when you tell them to, other types of square rudely move once every two steps, or move in the opposite direction that you tell them to, or even (and at this I AM INDIGNANT) in the direction an arrow states! It is in this world of barbarous non-conformist square that you must cause the <b>DEVOURING OF CYAN TILES FOR THE GOOD OF THE UNIVERSE</b> without having your squares shot, trapped or burnt by lava! <br><br>\r\n\r\nAlthough the graphics of this game are mostly ZZTAE random blending, that is not the point of the exercise. craNK has obviously sat down for a fair few hours and plotted out some of these puzzles. Also good is the old (but mostly unused in ZZT games) non-linear method the game is set out in; although one must only play seven levels to complete the game, the set is such that at the end of every level you are given a choice as to which level to go to next. This ensures a copious volume of the ethereal quantity known to the proletariat as \"replay value\" and is something we all must aspire to in our lives!

The first was Lynx\'s Trapper, a neat idea where you had to encase enemies in boulders to win. A good idea, and not typically something you\'d see. The second was Dsone\'s Lemming Hunter, where you had to run around and trap lemmings in a little cage and hope that they don\'t bounce out thanks to some of the game\'s bugs (er, I mean, \"features\"). <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut alas, the third one took it, a cameo-based seasonal romp called \"A Community X-Mas\", programmed collectively by Leamas and Hercules. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe game features you, the Player, as you visit a big cabin filled to the brim with enough ZZT cameos to make people just a little bit happy. And.. uh, it goes from there, I guess. I mean, it\'s a seasonal cameo game, do you expect some sort of decent plot? Probably not. <br><br>\r\n\r\nActually, enough bashing, more praising. The graphics in this game are incredibly good. You can\'t really go wrong in graphics when you\'ve got Leamas and Herc working on it, I\'ll say that. The ovehead view of the cabin is sweet, and the picture of the butler is also sweet. Then again, I had the sinking feeling that I was going to find JohnWWells slumped over on his chair, a knife in his back, and we all blame the butler, but eh, no such luck. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe game\'s play is generally just you running around, talking to the various ZZTers, and solving puzzles. In other words, typical Hercules gameplay, really. Well, if there\'s anything about this game, it\'s the fact that it can be humorous. Some of the banter that goes on in this game is sort of odd, though, especially given the fact that many of the cameos are rather inaccurate (LEAMAS, I WILL *KILL* YOU). <br><br>\r\n\r\nDo I have any idle complaints about this game?

In terms of plotting and gameplay, \"Burglar!\" is one of the most polished ZZT games I have seen in a long time. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe plotline, which begins simply enough, is proof positive of the first law of ZZT writing: originality isn\'t half as important as execution. The skeleton of the plot is certainly familiar (\"You are a thief. You perpetrate a series of burglaries and discover a conspiracy.\"), but the personality that MadTom injects into the story keeps it clever and fresh. Some games have you attempt to clear your name of a crime you didn\'t commit; this one has you pick the pockets of 40+ people in a matter of minutes to PROVE that you\'re a Fun Lovin\'/Smooth Criminal. There\'s no artifact-repairing, space station- destroying, newbie-bashing tripe here. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is largely inventory-engine based, and implemented very well. The puzzles make logical sense, fit into the story, and are in character (you CAN take everything that isn\'t nailed down - it\'s your job). Building in difficulty and intensity, the problems you face work up to a satisfying tenseness in the final mission. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIs there anything wrong with \"Burglar!\"? Well, there is some \"learning by dying,\" and there ARE a lot of instant deaths - but that\'s all part of the job description. The only other problems of note are some weak spots in the writing, and two unnecessary and downright sadistic safecracking puzzles, which require sharp hearing, a working PC speaker, and a lot of patience. Or the editor. The editor is good, here. Use the editor. Oh, and one puzzle in the final mission is a just a bit picky as to where you should be standing to use a certain object. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut these relatively minor problems shouldn\'t keep you from playing this excellent game - \"Burglar!\", the GOTM for May. <br><br>\r\n\r\n(Good boy, MadTom! Have a biscuit.)

In The Mercenary, however, WCB (for it is he) has managed to include the kind of complex RPG bells and whistles in The Mercenary that most people would think impossible to create in ZZT. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is the usual dungeon-crawler fare - slay monsters, get gems etc. - but WCB has made things a little more complex by including a \'level\' system. Each time the you kill a monster, you\'ll get a little more experience. Getting enough experience allows the player to move up a level, just like in traditional RPGs. The higher the level, the stronger the player\'s character becomes. This allows you to carry more ammo and torches, and increase your maximum health. Further innovation comes from the choice of a \"relic\" at the start of the game. This is a special item that gives the player certain abilities, thus changing the course of the game. The lockpick allows you to enter, um, locked doors, the Gauntlet provides superhuman strength so that you can smash boulders, and the rope allows access to otherwise unattainable areas. Depending on which you pick, the game will proceed in a different direction, thereby adding to the replay value that I hear is so popular with the kids these days. <br><br>\r\n\r\nStructurally, it\'s very similar to Diablo - the player begins in a small town, before proceeding to kill monsters in a series of nearby caves an catacombs, eventually destroying the evil at the heart of the dungeon. This, however, is its biggest flaw; Whilst Diablo\'s simplicity and lack of plot was made compelling by the various weapons and armour that could be found, The Mercenary has no such options, so the player has no real drive to complete the game, except to build up the statistics. That\'s not to say you won\'t find it fun to play, just that the lack of a plot sometimes drags a little. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAside from this, The Mercenary is a well-crafted, excellently programmed and cleverly designed game and certainly worthy of this month\'s GOTM. \r\n','','2002-06-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(96,'Classic Game of the Month Review: Defender of Castle Sin','','Featured Game','','','1999-03-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(97,'Classic Game of the Month Review: Final Fantasy Extreme','Hercules','Featured Game','I decided to make Final Fantasy Extreme the classic of the month, because I\'ve thougth for a long time that it was the best ZZT game out there.

It never got the attention it deserves, so that\'s why I made it Classic Game of the Month.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Third World War raged on planet Earth. An entire generation has been eradicated. The generation of today, one of peace-loving young adults, has built up a new society. Their city, Renessiance, is situated in the rainforests of South America.

The story is well-written and quite original.

It\'s made by CoolZx, who\'s best known for his series of \"Infestation\" games and add-ons. It\'s been released under both the Infinity Incorporated and Reptile House banner.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe game is a classic example of a \"temple\" game. What I mean with that, is that this is a game in which you have the explore a temple filled with tons of traps and dangers. The game lacks a real introduction or something: You just start in the temple and start exploring! \r\n<br><br>\r\nI mainly like this game for its great gameplay. I\'ve always loved games filled with traps like this one. The puzzles are a bit difficult, but that\'s always better than too easy. Added are some above-decent graphics too.

Halogen obviously knows a lot about history, as the story seems \"real\" in some strange way. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe thick plot is the best part of the game. Halogen has managed to write an extremely professional story, which really \"sucks\" you into the game (something otherwise only Rhygar and Chrono Wars can do). The graphics are great too, and Halogen uses a lot of original ways of fading/shading which adds a special atmosphere. The only thing which is a shame is that the third part of the trilogy has never been released, and probably won\'t ever either.

This game was released during the glory days of Damage Incorporated, when a lot of cool ZZTers like Bongo and darkmage were still around.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe game concept itself is amazingly simple: You (Johny) are hired as an employee in a fast food restaurant, and you\'ll have to do all kinds of jobs to make sure the restaurant keeps running, and the customers stay happy! The entire game is played on basically one board (in fact there are more boards, because else the board size would become way to big).br> \r\nThe game plays really neato, and the moment you start, you\'ll keep playing until you\'ve finished it.

However, when Nivek quit ZZT, he announced that all the other members of FFF Interactive were fake. Nivek was actually the only member.

Before Laeraf\'s master left to face Dauyath, drew a drop of each other\'s blood and swore an oath - the Blood Oath. If Laeraf\'s master didn\'t survive, Laeraf had to face Dauyath himself later. And Laeraf\'s master did die - now\'s time for you to face Dauyath yourself... \r\n<br><br>\r\nBlood Oath is a dungeon-exploring game and a good one too. The graphics of the dungeon itself are simple, but the cut-scene graphics are awesome. The story may seem a little weird, but it turns out to be pretty good. The ending of the game came as a complete surprise to me (you\'ll see what I mean if you play the game). \r\n<br><br>\r\nBlood Oath is one of the games that deserves a little more attention.

The game consists of three puzzle mini-games: BoulderXod, TuneXod and QuizXod. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBoulderXod is a Sokoban-like game for ZZT, which means you have to push boulders onto templates in order to finish the levels. If you\'ve ever played Sokoban (or a game similar to it) and liked it, you can be pretty sure you\'ll find this enjoyable, too. \r\n<br><br>\r\nTuneXod is the music puzzler of the game.

Of course, a lil\' tutorial is recommended. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe last mini-game is QuizXod, which exists of a bunch of multiple choice questions.

The king offered a reward for whoever rescues his daughters. Two adventures embarked on the journey, but did not return either. Then... you tried to be more succesful, by entering Castle Shadow yourself, the Warlock Domain...\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe style of this game can be called \"olschool-puzzle-adventure\". You\'ll have to explore a really big castle, and solve tons of puzzles along the way. They are not the type of puzzles of games like Nightmare or Xod, but more the \"pick things up, and doing things which changes things elsewhere\" :) style. Quite enjoyable, and really challenging, I must say.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAlong the way, there\'s also some action, like a couple of RPG battles. The RPG battles aren\'t that special, they are the normal turn-based style, but they\'re not that bad either. The graphics are not that fantastic, they are STK, but all rather simple, kind of like the first episodes of Chrono Wars. Cool things: You can kill most people in the game, even the good guys :), and there\'s a couple of endings! \r\n<br><br>\r\nThis game is a side-story to Htrae, Alan\'s \"larger\" project.

In these games there usually isn\'t a really strong storyline; you simply have to visit a lot of places, find items and kill enemies along the way. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe cool thing about this game is that, even though they are pre-STK, the graphics aren\'t that bad.

Yes. Many people forget that z2 is a site about SuperZZT too, and personally I think that SuperZZT should get more attention than it currently has. The Long Voyage was, apart from the standard SuperZZT game Monster Zoo, the first SuperZZT game that I ever played. It\'s made by Chris Jong, and was released in 1992 during Prodigy\' ZZT club period (for more information about this club check out the feature on the IF page). \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe player of this game, Dave Exmeno, was taking an ocean boat ride together with his girlfriend Penny. Then, someone took you and threw you off the boat! The goal of the game, of course, is to get back to the boat and save your girlfriend. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe thing that makes this game the classic that it is, is pure gameplay. From the moment you strand on the first isle, after you have been thrown from the boat, a flow of small puzzles, shooting parts, exploring and other things often present in the classic type ZZT games, will flood the player. For some reason, this makes the game extremely playable. Furthermore The Long Voyage is also a pretty long game, so it can occupy you for quite some time. The graphics of this game are nice, not fantastic, but certainly better than mediocre... Tossed in are also some cool bits of music and sound effects. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAll in all, I think The Long Voyage is the most fun SuperZZT game I ever played.

Cyber World is a pretty old game, it dates from 1996, made by James Wong. James was known as Multi and Raptor when he made this game, later on he changed that nick to Cygnus, and under that name he has been in a couple of cool companies; the legendary Software Visions, Dynamic Games and Interactive Fantasies. Cyber World was his first released game, and (besides a demo of his MegaZeux game Azeroth), he didn\'t finish any other games after this. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn this game you assume the role of a kid named Josh Swiz. Throughout the game you find out the boss of your father (who works at a company which produces glue) is planning some not-so-nice stuff. You, of course, have to prevent that, together with your friends Chris and Gary. The storyline and other parts of the game bear great resamblence to Code Red, which must have been an inspiration for James Wong (and for many other ZZT authors back in that time). \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe graphics of this game are nice, especially considering that it is already 5 years old; Cygnus has uses lots of Super Tool Kit and fading. Some nice tunes are tucked in too, which is cool. The gameplay is nice too, and overall, the game just gives me a nostalgic feeling.

Sombrero was Dark FLR\'s first game, which was released in late 1998. After Sombrero Dark FLR made another game (Seranade), the first few issues of the magazine ZZTV (now continued by Zenith) and the really neato tool ZZT Piano. After this, he disappeared from the ZZT scene again. Sombrero is probably the best of the two games he made. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn Sombrero you assume the role of a young boy, who\'s living in a small town in the desert. When you were only six yours old, your father was murdered. Your grandfather took over your custody, and since that moment he has raised you. But alas, he gets murdered, too. You swear revenge, and start a journey to find the killer... This turns out to be quite a nice story, with a couple of plot twists along the way too. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe thing that\'s special about this adventure are the battles. Instead of RPG battles like most adventures have, this battles uses \"sombrero battles\". Whenever a conflict between you and somebody else arises, the two of you go throw sombreros at each other to decide who is right. Quite innovative. However, the controls tend to be a bit irresponsive, which makes the fights are really hard (maybe too hard).<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe graphics of this game are really nice too, especially considering this game was released in 1998. A little downpoint of the game is that there\'s no sound and music, but hey, in 1998 there weren\'t any WiLs or Jacob Hammonds around to make great music :). Overall, this is a really cool game which definately deserves the download if you don\'t already have it, or the dust-off if it has been two years since you played it.','','2001-01-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(121,'Classic Game of the Month Review: Freedom','Hercules','Featured Game','Freedom SE, the graphical remake of the original Freedom is a great piece of art and music, which got all recognisition during the 1999 Interactive Fantasies Annual ZZT Excellence Awards and Hoodian Awards.

It is a shame kev-san is only rarely seen around these days.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Those who are about to rock salute you.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nI won\'t easily forget this quote, which is the opening sentence of the game. This leads you to the introduction, of a young man falling down, accompanied by a beautiful text about freedom.<br><br>\r\n\r\nkev-san himself described Freedom as a rock opera, which suits the game well. It\'s full of deep thoughts and beautiful ZZT music (as far as ZZT music can be beautiful).<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe graphical remake is also a good improvement over the original, since Blue Magus has provided the extremely original game with amazing artwork, that is true Anthony Testa style.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFreedom gives you something to think about and something to listen to while thinking about it. In my opinion, it\'s definitely one of the best artistical ZZT games. And by saying that, I don\'t mean to say it has the best graphics remember that art isn\'t all about graphics. The dialogue is as important as the accompannying art and music.<br><br> \r\n\r\nIf you haven\'t given this game a try yet, it may be a good idea to do so once, unless you don\'t like to watch instead of play.','','2001-03-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(122,'Classic Game of the Month Review: PPDV','Hercules','Featured Game','This month, we finally got to see Viovis\' absolute masterpiece, Purposedly Protected (or Produced) Dynamic Visualties II, after a good 2.5 years. In my opinion, it\'s a piece of art by Viovis himself, whom I prefer to refer to as an poetic artist, instead of a programmer. It just lost the GOTM race to Chuck\'s Los Refritos 9, but in celebration of the fact that we finally got to see PPDVII, I have made its predecessor, PPDV, Classic Game of the Month.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPPDV, also known as Purposedly Produced/Protected Dynamic Visualties, was released a few years. Back then, he already released some artistical games that defined a new genre, but PPDV was his biggest work to date. With PPDV, Viovis showed he is a true artist and a master of trippiness. And it\'s the trippiness that made Viovis\' style unique. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat is PPDV like? It\'s mainly a weird, but intersting story told by using art boards and pieces of text. There is no real gameplay -- it\'s looking, and being amazed or tripping or even being confused.<br><br> \r\n\r\nPPDV\'s art is weird and highly trippy. Some of the art boards may not be good-looking, but towards the end Viovis shows some mighty fine examples of his style. <br><br>\r\n\r\nInstead of drinking a cup of coffee in the morning, try playing PPDV for once. It has about the same effect and as Vork once said about PPDVII, PPDV\'s sequel, \"It\'s a good cup of coffee\". <br><br>\r\n\r\nPPDV may not mean as much to new ZZTers as it does to me and some older ZZTers, but it was a marker in Viovis\' history and Viovis has always been one of ZZT\'s most unique authors and one of the very few who defined his own style and had awards named after him. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIt\'s classic, that\'s for sure. However, it is not sure whether or not you\'ll like it. Some people will love it, others might find it too strange for comfort.

Star Troopers is a game made by Spock, who was one of the two main members of the company Starfield Software back in 1997/1998 (The other one was eJECTION13), which was a really great company back then. Star Troopers is probably the best of the two games he created (Star Troopers and Wizard\'s Apprentice).<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn Star Troopers, you assume the role of a young trooper for the Interstellar Union for Senient Races (IUSR). This union, consisting of a couple of races, has recently gone into war with the race of Truk\'l. Your task is to investigate what to Truk\'l are up too, and to unmask the Truk\'l spies that are said to be in the council of the IUSR. This provides a nice search through a couple of planets, during which you get to learn more of the customs, history and the people of these worlds. <br><br>\r\n\r\nStar Troopers is game which was released in a time when the science fiction ZZT game genre was at its peak - back then the famous Chrono Wars saga was also started! Being made by a ZZTer who is not really remembered anymore by most ZZTers (And that\'s a shame), it proves to be a quite enjoyable adventure game.

This version (released in 1999) when Igsel was still in his company Spiritual Tempest, was based on a game created by Salamander Software (in 1984) for a UK-only system called Dragon32. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHow does it work? Well, it\'s rather simple -- you start on one side of a hidden minefield and have to get to the other side. When you take a step, it will say how many mines are surrounding you (sort of like how Minesweeper for Windows works, though you don\'t click on the minefield, but you walk across it). Work your way through all levels, et voila! <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe graphics may be simple, but they\'re effective enough. As I said, this game can be rather addictive. If something turns out to be addictive, you know you\'ve created something good. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMined Out was nominated for a few awards in both the IF Annual ZZT Excellence Awards and the Hoodian Awards (like Best Puzzle Game in both of these awards) by the end of 1999, but didn\'t win any.

Chronos knows how to lay out space, keep secrets secret enough, and make visuals truly support the game and help supply atmosphere, instead of take any away. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHonestly, I enjoy this game as much, if not more, than any entrant of the Chrono Wars series... since this one hasn\'t been talked about much, however, I get the feeling that it\'s been forgotten, which is a huge shame... this game definitely deserves an ending (actually, a few more files before one would be better), even if I have to open it up in the editor and make one myself. Meh. <br><br>\r\n\r\nFor those who miss the days when high quality medieval RPGs were common in the ZZT community (one of those people being myself), this one\'s for you.

Rather, it was a time of experimentation, where people were still searching for the limits of zzt, and trying to see exactly what one could do in an already outdated game creation system. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOut of this era sprang one of the most influential ZZT games of all time, Kudzu. This game truly combines atmosphere, the situation at hand, and its puzzles to perfection. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the opening sequence, the player immediately learns that he knows nothing of his situation. All you know is that there is a parachute beside you and that you want to call home. <br><br>\r\n\r\nFrom there, Cly5m doesn\'t miss a beat, immediately giving the player many things to do. Walking around a strange complex, you do anything from defacing statues to shooting squishy things to breaking urns that clearly state not to break them. The atmosphere of the game is truly wonderful, as cly5m truly sucks the player in. The entire complex is really a joy to walk through (unless you\'re getting shot at by some mean looking guard type people.) <br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this game requires thinking, but you will be able to figure it out if you keep seaching. There isn\'t anything very innovative puzzle-wise, but the layout is marvelous. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat I truly like about this game is that it is so rooted in reality, something that is hardly seen in ZZT nowadays. Yet, while everything is very real, it feels as if everything is very unreal at the same time. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAll in all, you can truly thank this game for ZZT being what it is today. Without this masterpiece there would be no P0P, there would be no Winter... well, at least, not how we know them today. Do not let the graphics fool you, this is definitely one of the best ZZT games ever made.

But first of all, you must talk to the king.\" The english of Young Herc wasn\'t quite what it is today, but the plot is good enough... and still better than many. What truly makes \"Quest for the Immortals\" so great, however, are the high-quality visuals and, most importantly, its simple-yet-addictive gameplay. <br><br>\r\n\r\nFirstly, the graphics. Herc\'s STK abilities weren\'t as good as they are today, but the colors and blends provide a fine atmosphere, and are pleasant to the eye. Secondly, the way the game plays is somewhat like the action genre, mixing easy interaction amongst characters with, of course, early ZZT shooting and item collecting.

In a nutshell, you play the game as Simon Groves; a prepubescent lad who, with his friend Fred, unwittingly shoulders the hefty task of saving the world from the Sigmas. The Sigmas are somewhat self-explanatory, being a horde of megalomaniac aliens shaped like the Grecian Symbols of the same name.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe game begins in Simon\'s room and a dialog reveals to the player the enigma of the \'Blue Moon\' (the plot crux around which the rest of the game moves about), an odd entity that had appeared in the earth\'s stratosphere approximately 6 weeks ago. After a bit of wandering around his house and some abusing of small furr\'d animals, Simon realises that his immediate family, as well as the other of the Coaster residents, are acting quite out character. He takes the obvious action of finding Fred, the only other individual that seems unaffected, and together they decide to get to the bottom of the mystery. From here on in, the scenery changes and plotline advances occur quite rapidly, with even The Kave making a radioactively trippy appearance. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAlthough Blue Moon is of the action genre, it makes use of simple mini-puzzles on each board to advance the player. Later on, it also features a segment of rather neat mini-games which do well in adding variety to game play. The graphics and music within the game are of decent quality (view it within its timeframe, people), and give some insight into Zenith\'s evolution as a programmer and artist. The humour within the game also has his name scrawled all over it in bright crayon marks; Nadir\'s psychopathic wackiness alone proves entertaining enough to keep any cynics at bay. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThough somewhat quaintly endearing (\"HI MOM!\") in parts, I guarantee Blue Moon to be a satisfyingly solid play with a good deal of replaying value. Indeed, it is definitely a worthy CGotM awardee and a rather cute example of one of Nadir\'s classical era games. There is no more to say. Go play it, fools; and be amused!

It\'s time that I stuck my proverbial nose where it doesn\'t belong. I am Mike Renner, known to a great lot of you as Tseng, and a select few of you as \"that fucking asshole, Tseng\". I\'m taking Kracken\'s place for writing Classic Game of the Month, since she\'s ill, and I happened to be online at the time. Insomnia works wonders, I always say. I\'ll STRESS that I am not Kracken. She uses much bigger words than I. <br><br>\r\n\r\nNow, choosing Classic Game of the Month is an easy process for me. I just look at what\'s chosen, then choose something else. Something that deserves it. Most people who will see this game on CGotM will think that it\'s Kracken\'s call, and she\'s giving this to Nadir because they\'re all loveydovey. In truth, she just gave me the reigns to pick what I wanted. It\'s a game that\'s been constantly emulated (I know I\'ve tried it), but never duplicated. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLebensraum was it. <br><br>\r\n\r\nNadir\'s always had a handle on fun ZZT games. I go on record in saying that Dragon Woods was awesome, as was Blue Moon, the Fucking Egg Games (the one thing Testa ever left me with that I still use to this day is that name), and Untitled. Lebensraum is the epitome of the ZZT action game, essentially a game that allows you to run around and shoot without abandon. You are Jim Cowvitz, and you are a prisoner in a Nazi camp. Obviously, you greatly annoyed someone up there and now you\'re in the physical equivilant of listening to Hanson on full blast with about fifty Hanson-hating spectators around you, armed with rotten eggs. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe game drops you right in the middle of a Nazi camp, and obviously, unless you have some sort of deathwish, you have to go escapies. It\'s similar to going to the bathroom, except that you\'re going to make the Nazis wet their pants. So you take what I can only assume to be a machine gun and you begin turning your enemies into a bloody form of swiss cheese. This game would be banned by animal\'s rights activists, since you also get to shoot dogs. Isn\'t this a lovely game? <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe AI of the enemies involved is rather simple and effective, as the enemies often move *just* before your bullet strikes them, which will annoy the hell out of you. There\'s a sufficent ammount of ammunition around to get the job done, and it\'s one hell of a job to get done. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut if all I were to talk about are the intricates of the game\'s fighting, itself, it would get boring. In the game, you don\'t know what\'s behind a door until you actually open it. Once you open it, the details of the room show up. Maybe a rug, a Nazi flag, suits of armor, and, of course, the enemies. This also works for around the corner, and Zenith took a ludicrous amount of detail to do this. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut if you think THAT\'S the gist of the game, you\'re sadly mistakened. Zenith has also taken the time to add secret rooms in all of the levels in the game, hidden from view of the player. It allows more playability of the game, allowing you to play to your heart\'s content, especially with the four different difficulty levels. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIf there\'s one problem with the game, it\'s the fact that Zenith began to run out of memory after finishing the third level, and thus, he had to attach the ending. With a rivet gun. To make it up for everyone, he *laughs evilly* included a little bonus game where I, Tseng, got to kill everyone in #darkdigital. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOkay, so I have a soft spot for the fact that I get to shoot Vampy/Jawatrader. SUE ME.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut all in all, Lebensraum is one of the BEST action games you\'ll ever play, filled with secrets and shooting action, and with four difficulty levels, a novice or an expert can play Lebensraum. It\'s a game that will kick nine hundred different kinds of ass and still have a line of asses around the corner to kick.','','2001-12-01',1,'html',1,NULL,'',''),(131,'Classic Game of the Month Review: Warlord\'s Temple Beta','Zenith','Featured Game','Warlord\'s Temple, by Matt Williams, is an old game which, whether you realise it or not, has influenced your lives in such phantasmagorical ways your small human minds cannot possibly hope to comprehend!

Mysteriously, you come upon all manner of mysteriousness! <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhich explains NOTHING to the poor reader. I apologise.

As such, the castle is full of evil demons and all manner of things with sharp point mandibles that want you suck your soul out and sodomise it repeatedly.

Being a helpful (read: stupid) sort of chap, you hook his brain up to ZZT, turn his mind into a ZZT game and enter it to put things in order. Right.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStill, the game itself is a little more satisfying. Like most AKWare games it\'s fairly nonliner, being split up into five different areas of which you must complete four before entering the final area. Each section varies in difficulty, from the fairly easy restaurant (!) to the far harder \"Right hemisphere\". The game\'s wonderfully imaginative, featuring a logic factory, a crrazy imaginative world and - heh - a literal \'train of thought\' amongst other curious things. All are represented by colourful, well shaded graphics (particularly in the RPG battles).<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is varied and switches between regular bullet-fests, puzzles and RPG battles. It\'s not perfect; it occasionally relies on pre-programmed enemies or (hnngh) boulder-pushing puzzles, and the appearance of the AKWare quiz machine is a wee bit annoying (especially since most of the answers only really made sense at the time, if at all).<br><br>\r\n\r\nDespite these flaws, however, it remains a solidly entertaining little game.

Back then, dinosaurs ruled, Gutenberg had just invented the Bible, and being a terrorist meant threatening to steal your neighbor\'s donkey\'s genitals. Graphics weren\'t exactly Dutchy-keen, and WiLLy VaniLLi was yet to come around to attempt to program paradise... don\'t even bother mentioning the car, all the ZZT world had was the wheel. Despite all that, Sivion manages to use Ms. Ja(ck,n)son\'s colors extremely well; boulders background rooms similar to many-an-IF/Knightt-game, simple-yet-purdy shades show off caves, fields, and humorless desert, and it\'s pretty easy to tell what\'s a house and what\'s a shark (no worries, drac0, you can see \'em just as well stoned and/or drunk!)... while enemies (other than the pre-programmed ones, of course) carry out code smoothly and almost bug-free... throw a few degree symbols at \'em, n\' they\'ll vanish sooner than you can say \"I can\'t believe I actually downloaded a GOOD game, for once...\"! Monthigos also set flags without fault, as well as \"/i\"s in character dialogue. <br><br>\r\n\r\nKeep your eyes peeled, kids, it\'s time to cover storyline! Sivion\'s text is cliched, full of bad jokes (I\'m sure you don\'t mind them, though, since you\'ve read this far), and it annoyingly scrolls at the bottom of the player screen... however, at the same time, it\'s enough to hold interest and attention. Genies, kings, wizards, libraries... nice, but a few owls and crystals that secretly keep the world alive would help. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd, now, the recommendations... if you\'re a Leamas fan (LOME, Thief 3... especially LOME) like me, take a look.

Or, rather - plots, because much like its bigger brother Code Red, Coolness features multiple endings and plotlines (three in total). You\'ll find yourself either fighting the usual \"evil aliens\", saving the local swimming pool from a mad bomber, or getting stranded in a space-station. Each one is packed with puzzles, and although they admittedly aren\'t too difficult, they still provide a bit of a challenge. It\'s not perfect, and there ARE some curiously random bits (a rocket?

As ever, the plot (\"stop the rise of stupidity\") is almost non-existant, and only serves as a flimsy excuse for the game itself. And what a game! Timed missions, shoot-\'em-ups, puzzle solving, platform sections, 3D mazes, RPG battles - the gameplay is wonderfully varied and challenging . Better yet it\'s non-liner, so that whilst you must complete certain sections to complete the game, the order in which you do so is up to you. There are also a few secrets dotted about here and there to encourage replay and exploration. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe jokes are the usual pop-culture stuff, and admittedly most of the subjects (Space Jam, Men In Black) have grown a little old in the intervening years. Still, they should still raise a little chuckle from you every now and again (although some are a little bit too \"hey I\'m crrrrazy!\" for my tastes). <br><br>\r\n\r\nAlthough the graphics swing between \'adequate\' and \'excellent\' (with the boss battles being particularly pretty), the enclosed font polishes up the presentation no end.

Ever since then this game has always been my favorite ZZT game \r\never. In 2008 I decided to download ZZT onto my laptop and start playing again. \r\nEventually, on June 29, 2008, I ended up starting a walkthrough for the game, as \r\nthere seem to be none online so far.\r\n\r\nAs always, if I have made any mistakes in this FAQ, see Section VIII - \r\nAdditional Help for more information.\r\n\r\n*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*\r\nII.

Story\r\n*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in a town called Coaster, located in the kingdom of \r\nCoastilvania. The old king, King Safnax, was a fair ruler, but unfortunately he \r\nended up dying. His heir to the throne, King Asphalt, was completely different \r\nin that he was, basically, a douche. During his reign Coastilvania ended up \r\nfalling into disrepair, and people started to become a lot less well off. Thus, \r\na movement was formed called Coastilvanians Against Tyrannical Saddos (CATS).\r\n\r\nCATS was founded to try to get Asphalt off the throne, but since violent methods \r\nwouldn’t work, they had to find a peaceful way of doing it. However, peaceful \r\nmethods didn’t work either, until one of the CATS members, Hasselhorf Dunchvitz, \r\nfound a mind-controlling gem called the Minfannon, located deep within the \r\nSilurian Volcano. Nobody wanted to get it, though, until a wizard named Lindor \r\nMacWellianson (PhD in magic) got really drunk and said he would go get it. Now, \r\nLindor (i.e. you) has to go get it.\r\n\r\n*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*\r\nIV. How to Play\r\n*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*\r\n\r\nThis game is just like other ZZT games, in which you must investigate things, \r\nshoot stuff, and basically try not to die.\r\n\r\nControls are just basic ZZT controls:\r\n\r\nArrow Keys:                 Move\r\nShift + Arrow Keys:         Shoot\r\nT                           Use torch\r\nS                           Save\r\nQ                           Exit game\r\n\r\nKeys can be used to unlock doors. Keep in mind that you can only have a maximum \r\nof one of a certain color key at any given time (i.e., you can\'t have two Yellow \r\nKeys or Cyan Keys at once).\r\n\r\nGems give you one health point each and are used for currency.\r\n\r\nFor more information press the H button for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*\r\nV. Tips/Hints\r\n*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*\r\n\r\nSave often. That is the number one rule for ZZT games, because you can literally \r\nsave at any time.\r\n\r\nThe number two rule is not to save at a point where you cannot finish, because \r\n\r\nDon’t be afraid to touch things to see what they do. You might make progress on \r\nyour quest! The worst thing that can happen is that you’ll die, but if you \r\nfollow rule #1, that won’t be a problem.\r\n\r\n*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*\r\nVI. Walkthrough\r\n*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*\r\n\r\nFinally, the meat of the guide – the walkthrough!\r\n\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\nPart 0. Before the Game\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\n\r\nAt the start of the game, you have four doors:\r\n\r\n-Upper left (Intro): Tells you the backstory of the game. Note that you can only \r\nenter this door once.\r\n-Lower left (Plug me in): Shows a list of other games by Interactive Fantasies.\r\n-Upper right (Game): Starts the game.\r\n-Lower right (Characters): Shows biographies of each of the main characters.\r\n\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\nPart 1. What Have You Gotten Yourself Into THIS Time?\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\n\r\nYou start the game in your house, having just woken up from a MASSIVE hangover \r\nfrom getting so wasted the night before. The first thing you do (well, after \r\ntaking an Aleve for your killer headache, or whatever they had back in those \r\ntimes) is to get dressed and get some gems and face the world. In the left \r\ndrawer of the dresser is some gems. Touch it twice to get all of the gems inside \r\n(you’ll miss a few if you only touch it once), then touch the right side to get \r\ndressed in a robe and pointy hat. Once you’ve done that, open the door and step \r\nout into Coaster.\r\n\r\nTalk to the teal man if you want, then go downstairs to the blacksmith’s (AKA \r\nthe CATS headquarters). Once in there, talk to Millard, who will tell you what \r\nyou did last night (i.e., threw up all over the place and claimed you would go \r\nget the Minfannon). He’ll then instruct you to get a map from Hasselhorf (the \r\ngray guy on the top right), so get that from him. Last, but not least, is \r\nPrincess Salmonella. Talk to her once for some small talk, talk to her again to \r\nmake her say \"Yeah, whatever\", and then talk to her a third time to get a Red \r\nKey. You’ll need this to enter her tent later on. Keep talking to her if you \r\nwant, until she tells you to shaddup and go get the Minfannon already.\r\n\r\nThe next thing you want to do before leaving Coaster is to get supplies. Go to \r\nthe store (top right) and buy some shot (magic charges) and some torches (see \r\nSection VII – Shoppes for prices). After you’re done there, you’ll see a dark \r\nmagenta guy. Talk to him and give him a gem. He’ll then laugh crazily, because \r\nhe’s a tricky bum who just tricked you. Unfortunately for him, you now have \r\nammo, so shoot him to make him cough up that gem plus two others. Serves him \r\nright!\r\n\r\nWith that, you are now ready to leave Coaster and begin your journey!\r\n\r\nGo west one screen and open the gate, then head west to a screen with a dead \r\ndragon and two burnt poachers (serves them right). You’ll see two eggs in a \r\nnest, so go over and investigate them. Touch the right one and it’ll hatch into \r\na cute baby dragon. Once you’ve done this, go back to the previous screen (going \r\nwest will just take you to a dead-end; this will be remedied later though!) and \r\nthen head south to the next screen, which is Salmonella’s campsite.\r\n\r\nAt the campsite, go through the Red Door and enter the tent. At the southeast \r\ncorner is a dresser. In the left drawer is a bunch of leaves; take them, as \r\nyou’ll need them later (in true RPG fashion). There is nothing else you need \r\nhere, but you can look around and have some fun before leaving.\r\n\r\nGo south from the campsite and cross the bridge, then go north back to the camp \r\narea and touch the flashing square for a bonus of 30 ammo, 5 torches, 8 gems, \r\nand 50 points, then head back to the bridge screen. To the east is a fisherman \r\nwho can sell you fish or give you information. Fish cost 2 gems and give you 10 \r\nhealth points; the information is about the cave to the west.\r\n\r\nGo back to the bridge and go west to the next screen. You’ll see a cave; ignore \r\nthat for now, unless you wanna die! Head west and north to a screen with a \r\nunicorn with a special necklace. Go up to it and it’ll run off. Touch it again \r\nand then give it the leaves you took from Salmonella’s tent (trying to take the \r\nnecklace will get you nowhere, and shooting it will make it kill you). It’ll \r\nmunch on the leaf so you can take the necklace.\r\n\r\nNow that you have the necklace, go back to the cave area and go inside. Head \r\nnorth, north, north through the tunnel. You’ll end up being trapped in the \r\ntunnel, but don’t worry about that; just keep going north! At the next screen, \r\nthere is a scene with five druids and a young girl strapped to a table. Go north \r\nand the druids will then plunge a knife into the poor thing’s heart and kill \r\nher. This is such a horrifying sight, so you try to keep from being seen, but \r\nyou end up sneezing and blowing your cover. The druids have spotted you, and \r\nlook to make you their next lunch. If you have the necklace, it’ll start glowing \r\nand kill the druids; otherwise, game over for you (I told you not to enter \r\nbefore I said it was safe >.>). After the druids are gone, go to the girl’s head \r\nand search her. She’ll have a piece of coal in her pocket, so take it and head \r\nback south. The blockage will be gone, so you can finally exit that creepy cave.\r\n\r\nHead back north to the gate screen and go west to where the baby dragon is. Give \r\nhim the piece of coal. it’ll sneeze and set the forest on fire, removing that \r\nannoying roadblock from the woods. Yay! You can finally enter Dragon Woods! Go \r\nwest and make your way through the trees, then head north to continue your \r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\nPart 2. In the Woods\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\n\r\nOnce you enter the woods, you start getting tired, so you decide to lie down for \r\na rest. Unfortunately for you, you get confronted by a trio of wildmen, who \r\nknock you unconscious and drag you away. Go through the passage to the next \r\nscreen to see yourself tied to a stake. You’ve just become these wildmen’s \r\ndinner! Fortunately, since you’re a wizard, you have a handy-dandy transport \r\nspell that’ll get you out of this. If you have less than 25 ammo (and you \r\nshouldn’t, unless you really took your anger out on that bum), your game will \r\nend; otherwise, the transport spell will work (costing you – you guessed it – 25 \r\nammo). Once you’re free, the wildmen get angry at you and confront you. Go \r\nthrough the door to start your first boss battle!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBOSS BATTLE 1: The Wildmen\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou\'ll start this battle with an extra 200 health points and an extra 100 ammo. \r\nThere are three wildmen here, and each one has a different weakness. They are:\r\n\r\nBlue Wildman: Pushing\r\nMaroon Wildman: Shooting\r\nCyan Wildman: Bombs\r\n\r\nYour first target should be the blue one, as he is the fastest to take out. Once \r\nyou finish him off, target the maroon wildman, making sure not to use up all \r\nyour ammo. Wait until he stays in a column or row for a bit, then start spraying \r\nhim with bullets (about 3 or 4 in a row each time; he\'ll die off pretty quickly \r\nif you\'re accurate enough).\r\n\r\nThe cyan one should be your last target, and this one takes a bit of thinking. \r\nTo kill this one you have to shoot bombs off of him, then set them off. One or \r\ntwo shots are usually enough to knock a bomb loose from him. The best way to go \r\nabout this is to stay on one side of the stake, go to the other side and try to \r\nshoot him quickly, activate the bomb, then go quickly back to the other side and \r\nhope it hits him. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nEND BOSS BATTLE\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOnce that little ordeal is over with, exit the cave. Or, at least, that part of \r\nthe cave. Sorry for getting your hopes up. Light a torch and find your way out \r\nof here. The good news here is, there are no enemies in this cave. The bad news \r\nis, there IS a maze. To escape it, go to the first portal and go Right, Left, \r\nDown, Right, Up, Right, Up, Right, Down. Head east from here to exit the cave. \r\nOnce outside, follow the pathway to the next screen. In this screen, pick up all \r\nthe ammo magazines by the corpses, then continue right into the deepest, darkest \r\npart of the woods.\r\n\r\nIn this part, you’ll need plenty of torches. Fortunately this screen has plenty \r\nof torches. Anyway, follow the path eastward and take the second path north. \r\nFirst, though, go straight north from here to enter a secret room with plenty of \r\ngoodies. When you get close to the open area you’ll be accosted by lions and \r\ntigers that follow you. Go to the southwest corner of this area and shoot at the \r\nenemies until they all die, then proceed into the room. Go north, so that about \r\nthree monsters start chasing you. Kill the rest of them off then collect the \r\ngoodies, including a White Key, then head back out of the room to the main \r\npassageway.\r\n\r\nOpen the White Door and shoot at the centipede until all its components are  \r\ndead. Run QUICKLY to the right to avoid the bears hiding in the walls, then \r\nshoot the ones you see. Collect the three torches and continue QUICKLY going \r\nright (again, more bears in the walls – sneaky bastards) until you reach an \r\nintersection. Take the north path and shoot the gem and the bear behind the gem \r\n(or get the gem AND shoot the bear, but I only recommend this if you have very \r\nfast reflexes), then follow the pathway to another room with several ruffians \r\nand a tiger. Get the first ammo magazine and quickly move back left when the \r\nfirst ruffian chases you, then take him out. Carefully go into the room and coax \r\nthe rest of the enemies to come out so you can kill them, then get the stuff in \r\nhere (including a Red Key) and head back to the intersection.\r\n\r\nGo through the Red Door (the one to the right) and start shooting at the barrage \r\nof enemies coming towards you. Kill them off and continue right (there may be a \r\ntiger left; kill it of course) and get the stuff in there, including a Purple \r\nKey. Go back to the intersection and go through the Purple Door to meet a red \r\nkid, who will ask you a series of questions. The answers, in order, are:\r\n\r\n1. Cantera999\r\n2. Casey McCann\r\n3. What’s stopping it?\r\n4. They’re ALL annoying (Translation: Freebie question for you!)\r\n5. Dobermans\r\n\r\nAfter you pass the boy’s quiz, go down into the room and get the gems, the Blue \r\nKey, and the Golden Exclamation Mark Bonus (100 health, 40 ammo, 10 torches, 8 \r\ngems) and head back out to the beginning of the forest. Go all the way west to \r\nthe last north fork (the first north fork you saw coming in), get rid of the \r\ngem/bear combo, and go through the Blue Door to exit the darkest part of the \r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nIn the next screen you have a bunch of lions. Kill them, because if you don’t, \r\nthey’ll hurt you. Take that, PETA! Justifiable... leocide? Is that it? Should \r\nbe. Anyway, go east out of the woods, then east another screen to a screen with \r\nthe ZZT Bar.\r\n\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\nPart 3. Of Towers and Castles\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\n\r\nThe first thing you can do here is to go into the inn and chat it up with \r\neveryone. One of them, Zenith (the transparent green guy in the upper right) \r\nwill give you a hint (GRYBWCP). Remember this for later. In the inn you can talk \r\nto the barmaid and ask her for directions and buy stuff (ammo, torches, or a \r\ndrink to give you health). You can only buy one drink though, since she seems to \r\ncare about your health (and the welfare of the other patrons). You should stock \r\nup on ammo if you’re low (or really, stock up on ammo anyway; you’ll need it). \r\nSee Section VII – Shoppes for prices.\r\n\r\nThe barmaid will tell you that the Silurian Volcano is just south of here, so \r\nonce you’re done in the bar go south to the next screen. Unfortunately, a troll \r\nblocks the way. Talk to him and he’ll ask you for a million gems (would be \r\ninteresting to see if you could hack a million gems in – but that’s another \r\nstory!), which of course you don’t have. You\'ll ask the troll what else could \r\nmake him let you pass, and he tells you that there’s an evil king named Lord \r\nCracula who kills trolls and lives in the castle to the west. Your job is, \r\nnaturally, to go kill the evil king.\r\n\r\nHead north and go all the way west to the castle. Head inside and proceed until \r\nyou reach an invisible talking wall. The wall will ask you for a password, which \r\nyou don’t know yet, so don’t worry about picking the right one for right now. Go \r\nback to the bar and ask the barmaid if she knows it. Unfortunately, she doesn’t, \r\nbut she says that you can go to the castle in Grapemarket to see if you can find \r\nsomething there.\r\n\r\nGo east and up the hill to reach Grapemarket. You’ll see a traveller walking \r\ntoward you and bleeding. Talk to him and he’ll say something about the tower. \r\nUnfortunately, that’s where you have to go next, so go east to the next screen \r\nand enter the tower and help some grey people or whatever the traveller was \r\nsaying.\r\n\r\nOnce inside, you’ll see a bunch of people in cages. They explain that they have \r\nbeen caught by a tribe of bogeymen and are about to become the bogeymen’s next \r\ndinner. So, you have yet another job – save the people from the bogeymen. Go \r\nnorth to the next room and you’ll see a bunch of bogeymen. This first room is \r\ntough, but there is a fairly easy way to kill them, if you know a trick. The key \r\nis to get rid of one of the doors and shoot at them until they die. To do this, \r\nstart from the first room and go through the rightmost door. Once you get into \r\nthe next room, go left to go through the door by it. Go back up through the \r\nrightmost door to get rid of the rightmost door in the north room. Voila. The \r\nbogeymen (at least the southernmost ones) are easy pickings now. The only way \r\nthey can hurt you is by touching you, and once you shoot them they stop moving \r\n(they must be into S&M or something), so once one comes into your column, shoot \r\nuntil they die. It takes something like 10 shots to kill each of them, so be \r\nsure you have plenty of ammo.\r\n\r\nOnce you take care of a few bogeymen, go north and start shooting the remaining \r\nones south of the oval. Go north of the oval and kill the rest. Once you finish \r\noff the last bogeyman, the east door will open, so go through it. In this room \r\nthere is a button that will open another door, so your task is to find it. Each \r\nroom has a differently colored bed, so I will tell you which is in each dresser \r\nin each room. (*) indicates things you can get.\r\n\r\nColor       Left            Right\r\n\r\nPurple      Nothing         Gem (*)\r\nCyan        Nothing         Bogey photo album\r\nGreen       Nothing         Bogey clothes\r\nBlue        50 ammo (*)     Bogey... stuff...\r\nRed         Nothing         Nothing\r\nYellow      A hedgehog      THE BUTTON (*)\r\n\r\nGet all the good stuff from each dresser without waking the bogeymen (you can \r\nonly wake them up by touching them or shooting them), then once you’re finished \r\npush the button. This will wake all the bogeymen, so just run as fast as you can \r\nout of here. I really mean that. RUN. FAST. Alternatively, you can take out each \r\nbogeyman individually so they can’t kill you, although this will end up wasting \r\nyour ammo, so you should just get out of there while you can. However, you can \r\nkill the two bogeys in the bottom two rooms (the purple and blue rooms) if you \r\nreally wanna kill bogeys, because those two pose the biggest threat to your \r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nOnce you escape the east room, the west door will open, so go in there. There is \r\na hidden lever in here, and since there are no prizes or hidden items in here, \r\nyou can just hit the microwave, since that’s where the lever is. Once you touch \r\nthe microwave, make your way quickly towards the door, so that when the bogeymen \r\ncome, you can easily escape. This will open the north door and give you a health \r\nand ammo bonus, so go through it.\r\n\r\nIn the north room (whereupon entering, you will get a hefty health bonus of \r\n100), there is a podium with a button on it. Press it (no bogeymen will appear, \r\nthankfully) and it will give you the password for the castle (\"Where have the \r\nTeletubbies gone?\"). Go back to the entrance hall of the tower and you’ll see \r\nall the people in the cages go free. Exit the tower, and it will blow up, making \r\nit impossible to go back inside. Not like you need to be in that awful place \r\nanymore anyway. Also, if you want to go back to Coaster, just head south and \r\neast.\r\n\r\nHead back to the castle and talk to the talking wall again and tell it the \r\npassword (\"Where have the Teletubbies gone?\"). It will let you through to the \r\nnext area, a maze of invisible walls. From just outside the maze, go right 3 \r\ntimes, up 2 times, right 4 times, down, right 2 times, up, right 2 times, down, \r\nand right. Here you should be just to the left of the blue guy. Touch him to \r\nmake the invisible walls at the end of the maze disappear, then go left, up, \r\nleft 2 times, down, left, down 3 times, left 2 times, then go down to the next \r\narea.\r\n\r\nIn this maze, starting from just north of the teleporters, go down, right 2 \r\ntimes, up, left 4 times, down, left 7 times, up, down, right 3 times, up, left, \r\nand down to get to the other side. Head south to the next room.\r\n\r\nIn here, you’ll finally find a use for that \"GRYBWCP\" hint. Stand on each square \r\nin the correct order (Green, Red, Yellow, Blue, White, Cyan, Purple) to open the \r\ndoor to the east. In the next room, you’ll meet the evil Lord Cracula, who \r\nstands in the way of completing your quest.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBOSS BATTLE 2: Lord Cracula\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou start this battle with 100 extra health points (which, if you’ve been \r\nplaying well enough – meaning, you’ve saved before losing a bunch of health – \r\nshould give you a ton now). This is a typical shoot-em-up battle, where you just \r\ntry to shoot the evil Lord Cracula. Occasionally Cracula will put out a slime, \r\nbut you can just ignore those. The easiest way to kill him is to trap him along \r\nthe southernmost wall and just shoot at him until he croaks and spits out blue \r\nblood. This battle is quite a bit easier than the one with the wildmen. Note \r\nthat whenever you hit Lord Cracula he’ll say \"Where\'s the mustard?\"\r\n\r\nNote: Be ABSOLUTELY SURE that when you kill Lord Cracula he doesn\'t block your \r\nway out. I’ve killed him right in front of the exit before. Trust me, it can \r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nEND BOSS BATTLE\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHead back out to the main room of the castle. Yes, you do have to go through the \r\nmazes again, but it should be a lot easier now. Starting from just below the \r\nsecond maze, go up, right, down, right 4 times, up, right 4 times, down, left 2 \r\ntimes, and up to get to the invisible wall maze. From the rightmost opening go \r\nup 2 times, right 2 times, up 3 times, left, up, left 4 times, down 2 times, and \r\nthen just head right and out of the castle.\r\n\r\nGo back to the troll at the bridge and let him know the good news. He\'ll let you \r\npass, so go south to the next screen. Head all the way south and then go west \r\nthrough the door to continue your journey.\r\n\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\nPart 4. Hot Hot Hot!\r\n*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r\n\r\nAfter several hours you finally reach your destination: the Silurian Volcano. \r\nYou look around for a secondary canal (since you\'re not climbing that thing in a \r\nmillion years), and you find it. Once you get inside, head north to a screen \r\nwith a sign. It starts to get very hot in here now, so you should probably get \r\nsome clothing to protect you from the heat. However, you’re not quite deep \r\nenough to be bothered by the heat yet, so ignore the northern path for now and \r\ngo west into the volcano.\r\n\r\nThe first room has many enemies and several twists and turns. To get through \r\nthis you can either just barge through (you can do this if you have enough \r\nhealth – remember, try not to use up too much ammo!), or you can do it the hard \r\nway: through shooting all the enemies to hell. To keep safe, you can stay on one \r\nside of the corner and shoot at everything that comes to you before continuing \r\nonward. In the middle of the board there are two yellow squares. The right one \r\ncontains a Yellow Key, and the left one contains a Yellow Door. Get the key and \r\nopen the door, then touch the wall to the left to get a bonus of 60 health, 40 \r\nammo, and 100 points. Note that towards the westernmost part of the volcano, \r\nthere are sharks in the water – you CANNOT kill these, unfortunately, but if you \r\nhave enough health you should be able to get by without coming too close to \r\ndying.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve killed all of the enemies in this area, go back to the previous \r\nscreen and north to the Temple of Obsideon and enter one of the three doors. A \r\ndwarf approaches you and asks you to go on another quest (gahhhh). He asks you \r\nto get rid of a pesky dragon that’s been killing dwarves for months, and to kill \r\nit you need to go through the volcano. Of course, since the Minfannon is in that \r\nway as well, and since you need protective armor to get through there, you have \r\nno choice but to help the poor dwarves.\r\n\r\nSo, your next task is to get some supplies. In the northeast part of the board \r\nis a vendor with pretty high prices. Fortunately though, you can give him 20 \r\npoints for a gem. Since you don\'t need points anymore you can spend all of your \r\npoints on gems, then spend your gems on ammo and health if you need it (you \r\nshouldn’t need health, hopefully). See Section VII – Shoppes for prices. In the \r\nsouthwest quadrant is a spell scroll where you can learn spells. Stock up on \r\nammo and learn all of the spells you can.\r\n\r\nProtection spell (40 MP)\r\nShort-Range Transport Spell (25 MP)\r\nFire & Ice (60 MP)\r\nAura Disruptor (80 MP)\r\nBarney Attack (100 MP)\r\n\r\nYour main priority here is to get the protection spell, since without it you \r\ncan’t progress any further into the volcano than you already have. Get that and \r\nany other spell you can/want, then head back into the volcano. In the furthest \r\nroom in the volcano you should see a bunch of arrows and blocks. Move the two \r\nhorizontal arrows in the second row two spaces to the left and let the arrows do \r\ntheir thing to free up the Red Key. Go west and north and open the red door, \r\nthen head north to the next room. In here you’ll meet a dragon. Of course, you \r\nhave to fight it.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFINAL BOSS: Dragon\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHere it is, the last boss of the game! Unlike the others, this is a turn-based \r\nRPG battle, so unfortunately this is completely luck-based. However, you can \r\nstill save between turns, so if you’re ahead, go ahead and save and if you get \r\nbehind, don’t be afraid to go back to that point. We won’t tell! >.>\r\n\r\nBoth you and the dragon have 19 HP to start the battle. \r\n\r\nThe dragon has three attacks:\r\n\r\nBreathe Fire (2 HP) – Basic dragon attack\r\nEarthquake (3 HP) – A rock comes down and tries to spear you\r\nIron Lion (4 HP) – A lion comes and tries to attack you\r\n\r\nYou have several attack options yourself:\r\n\r\nAttack (0 ammo, 1 HP) – Basic attack\r\nThrow rock (0 ammo, 2 HP) – Throws a rock at the dragon; note that you can only \r\ndo this if you’ve caught a rock after the dragon casts Earthquake\r\nShort-range transport spell (20 ammo, 3 HP) - Transports you to the other side \r\nof the dragon so you can shoot it\r\n*Fire & Ice (30 ammo, 3 HP) – Casts an ice spell on the dragon\r\n*Aura Disruptor (40 ammo, 4 HP) – Casts an aura spell on the dragon\r\n*Barney Attack (70 ammo, 5 HP) – Summons Barney to terrorize the dragon (isn’t \r\nthis technically a violation of the Geneva Convention?)\r\n\r\n(Note: Spells marked with an asterisk (*) denote spells that you have to learn \r\nback at the Temple of Obsideon.)\r\n\r\nThis battle is a typical turn-based RPG, in which you and the dragon alternate \r\nturns. It should go without saying that to beat this boss you have to take off \r\nall of its HP before it does the same to you.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nEND BOSS BATTLE\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHaving defeated the dragon, you reach the LightningDwarf village. There you \r\nfinally find the Minfannon! Pick it up to complete your quest. As you head out, \r\nthough, a guy appears at the north part of the room. It turns out to be the \r\nauthor of the game, Zenith. He transports you back to Coaster, where you watch \r\nthe ending scenes to the game.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have beaten Dragon Woods!

On the west side, one space north \r\nof the middle vertical bridge, the ‘water’ nearby is made of \r\nbreakables. Shoot it and touch the boulder-like thingy. Shoot the \r\nexposed fountain. Go north.\r\n\r\nThis guy turns invisible, shots a few bullets, then shoots a star. \r\nLuckily, you can shoot him more or less constantly and he won’t move \r\nif you hit him fast enough (which is quite slowly).

The hyper mode can be access if you load editor, and then the game file so you\'ll be on the starting board.  Next you open up the debut by pressing [?] and type +hyper.  Exit out and follow the title\'s instructions.\r\n\r\nBut before I start this walkthrough, here are some tips.\r\n\r\n- always talk to people more then once.\r\n- it pays to know who and where can you get your resources.\r\n- trying any random thing could give you bonus points.\r\n- reserve ammo, even if it means leaving extras behind.\r\n- it\'s best to wait before going any further in some places.\r\n- item swoop from backpack wisely.\r\n- HYPER: speed is the key.  if your mouse works, it will prove very useful.\r\n- HYPER: touching features might reveal a challenge token.  Remember you must put one token up to pick up another one.\r\n- Just have fun.  I know I have when I made this...kinda =/.\r\n\r\nThe beginning.\r\n\r\nTalking to william in the beginning will help you a bit about learning the world\'s features, such as the backpack engine.  When you jump down the hole, go down and you\'ll run into a bundle of torches.  The enemies down here are the bigrats, so melee attack them by touching them.  A example of getting bonus point, go where the exit is and go to the bottom left corner where a gem is trapped.  Touch the wall on the left three time to free the gem and get bonus points.\r\nIn hyper mode, there\'s a Red Timer on the bottom left corner set to 20 sec.  When it runs out, a crackle of thunder will sound and the bigrats will become HUGE and offer few points.  There\'s a bonus here to.  If you manage to fly through the tunnels and kill all the yellow rats, you\'ll get 20 gems, and points, and the rats stay small.\r\n\r\nYllimpse\r\n--PLACES\r\n- Weapon & Armory\r\n- ArseDemon Cave\r\n- Living Labrith\r\n- Thorny Thickets\r\n- Cyan Cat Cave\r\n- Consious Gate\r\n--USEFUL ITEMS NEEDED\r\n- purple keys\r\n- rifle cannon\r\n- HYPER:silencer\r\n\r\nAt this point, you should buy you some bombs, two is all you need for this game...I think, unless I miss something.  The ArseDemon Cave is optional to go into, it\'s just that the two boards(the cave entrence and the interior) has bonuses.  The woman under the tree wants you to kill the sharks which is no easy task and requires a lot of shells.  To kill the sharks, you need a rifle cannon.  Another bonus here is that you have a single boulder on the screen.  What\'s it for?  The tip is that the ArseDemon is very dangerous if a couple deside to exit the cave through it\'s entrance so...\r\n\r\nInside, there are a few arse biter, but still prove quite deathly.  Gems littered the floor, and there\'s a box of torches, and a life up(resets your health to 200) on the lower right.  In the hyper mode, a lot more arse biters are here...but the smaller, and rich with pts.  You\'ll get bonus if you clear all yellow ones before time expires.  - Two tokens are here.\r\n\r\nHead for the thorny thickets(a token is here too) and into the cave to the right.  Collect as many hearts as you can here while heading towards the top.  You need them.  Melees doesn\'t work with the cyan cats here so you need a gun.  The cats are evil, you shot one or one dies, a larger version will materialize anywhere, or IN YOUR FACE.  I hope you collected some hearts.  Take a shortcut out of the cave though the tunnel on the upper left, and head down and break the breakable.  HYPER:  There\'s shilloads of arsedemons about and you sure as heck don\'t want to freak with the pussycats too.  Getting a Silencer ready is the safest.\r\n\r\nRAINY WOODS part 1\r\n\r\n--PLACES\r\n- Rainy Wood Village\r\n- Mole Cave\r\n- Rifle Isle\r\n- Jesus Fish\r\n--USEFUL ITEMS NEEDED\r\n- waterdisk\r\n- translater\r\n- heat specs\r\n- grappling hook\r\n- a bomb\r\n\r\n- two token are here...\r\n- a purple key have sunkin into the marsh.\r\n\r\nJust lovely...Oh, the game...uh...Okey, you could go down to the village but you\'ll find out that you\'ll will need a translater to understand the seeming inanimate mushroom objects.  When you come back with one, find the one name Og.  He\'s your source of free health and bullet, and hints.\r\nThe bonus lies in the problem they are having in the village.\r\nMore tips can be found from Hiru\'Yaro\'s book which a former hunter is holding.  That will be the guy in yellow to the right of the warp.  Sometime, it won\'t work on your computer, XP user and such, so open the help file included in this game on a notepad.  This has info and tips on how to defeat enemies.\r\n\r\nOkey, now your choice now is to head for the foggy forest.\r\n\r\nFOGGY FOREST\r\n\r\n--PLACES\r\n- Mermaid\'s House\r\n- BIGA$$ FOGG\r\n--USEFUL ITEMS NEEDED\r\n- compass\r\n- heat specs\r\n- true specs\r\n- bomb\r\n- lots of ammo\r\n\r\n- one token is here...\r\n- biga$$ fogg has a purple key\r\n\r\nYou\'ll need plenty of ammo to scrap with the foggs.  They are immune to melees otherwise.  There are two thick fog patches on top and bottom from the Biga$$ fogg\'s entrance that are hard to maneuvor through...if you don\'t have a compass that will reveal the path through it.  You can find the compass at the very upper right of the rainy woods.  Heat specs will reveal enemies location at all times, and works with both foggs and bratz.\r\nThe mermaid here will give you a translator if you talk to her the second time.  HYPER:  The kid has something purple and shiny that need loosening up from him.\r\n\r\nThe Fogg boss likes to lap up stuff and can be it\'s own undoing.  If you get eaten, step back and shoot out the mouth.  It\'ll vomit you back up.  Get to the ! symbol to use one of your bombs, and set it at the opening of it\'s mouth.  You\'ll love what will happen\'s next.\r\n\r\nYour choices of places now is the Living Labrith, or Molten Degree.\r\n\r\nMOLTEN DEGREE\r\n\r\n--PLACES\r\n- <strike>Hamburglar\'s Hideout</strike>\r\n- Hiru\'Yaro\'s Hideout\r\n- Hell Hotell\r\n--USEFUL ITEMS NEEDED\r\n- rock ice\r\n- grappling hook\r\n\r\n- token behind the hell hotell\r\n- free purple key at yaro\'s place\r\n\r\nOnless you want to die a crispy death, you should have rockice at hand.  Just avoid the lavaworm, and head for the hotell.  There, you\'ll see nicholas cage singing \"My name is Jonas!!\"...okey I\'ll stop.  The guys on the floor that\'s flashing needs something from the snackbar so go to it and give it to him, her, or whatever.  Another will flash, so repeat two more times.  The last will give you a water disk.  HYPER:  Talk to Zeph for a boost.  He has no life, and that\'s why he\'s here.\r\n\r\nThe trick with the items.  Get the waterdisk first, and go to your backpack and ready your rockice, so you\'ll have one item.  THEN help the salaman upstairs.  You will have the grappling hook and rockice at hand.  It\'s the best way to travel around MD.\r\n\r\nHiru\'Yaro is a nice dragon and will give you the key freely.  But your goal is to get his glasses.  Careful not to end the conversation or you won\'t get it.  Say that you want his glasses, and then insult him with \"neuga please.\" and the fight comence.  Hide behind rock when he throws stars, and time the hits when he gets close.  Always keep moving.  The easiest way to take him down is to use a gun(you\'re a lame bastard if you do).\r\n\r\nLIVING LABRITH\r\n\r\n--PLACES\r\n- Dead Tree\r\n- Boulder\r\n--USEFUL ITEMS NEEDED\r\n- power arm\r\n\r\n- a purple key is ... I forgot where =b\r\n\r\nYour goal here is to release the water by pushing the boulder over.  But you\'ll need a device that pumps your arm up.  If you listen to Og about where he lost his item, you\'ll know exactly where.  To escape the labrith, shot the dead hyperpede on the board you\'ve came in.\r\n\r\nRAINY WOODS part 2\r\n\r\nIf your trip through molten degree was successful, then you have what you need to get the other purple key.  I can tell you now that you\'ll need ammo for this trip.  Get the waterdisk and move toward a mass of water to inter it.  Blast anything that gets too close, expecially the ray runner which can and will end your game in a flash.  To get the rifle cannon on the isle, you need a grappling hook to latch on a root.\r\nSearch the rising land paths to find the purple key.\r\n\r\nYou should have all four keys(or five in hyper mode) to return to consiousness at this point.  If you don\'t then I suck at giving game hints, and need to go back yllimpse.\r\n\r\nA Small Spoilers.\r\n- get the key to the thickets and leave the gun there.  Get enough gems to get a half armor, or keep rolling which ever suits you.  Go where Hiru\'Yaro lives and kick his aiyaz.  You\'ll get HUGE POINTS for owning him without a weapon on.\r\n\r\nWell, that\'s all I have for you so good luck, and have fun at ZZT.','','1970-01-01',1,'text',1,NULL,'',''),(154,'Pop Walkthrough','Foxman','Walkthrough','POP\r\n\r\nProgramming errors:\r\nIn the board `i want my mummy,\' edit the programming of the top head\r\nin the\r\nsecond column from the right.

Go north, then west. In this side-\r\nscroller, jump onto the right part of the M, then the \r\nright part of the L, then the left part of the E. Move to \r\nthe right part of the E, then jump up and right eight \r\ntimes, then move right one space. Get the red key and go \r\neast. Unlock the doors and flip the switches.

Go east.\r\n\r\nAhh! Californian raisins! You can either take these guys \r\non yourself or radio in for backup. I recommend doing it \r\nyourself - the backup basically sprays the entire screen \r\nwith bullets, so you’ll lose a lot of health. The small \r\nraisins take four hits each and the big one takes ten. \r\nTake out the big one and the little ones die too, but \r\ntake out all the little ones first and the big one can’t \r\ndie.\r\n\r\nGet the purple key, go south and get the clay. Go north \r\nthen west twice. Unlock both doors and enter the grey \r\npassage. \r\n\r\nFirst, take out the things on the bottom. The things on \r\nthe sides will start throwing stars, so shoot them. Shoot \r\nthe green thing before it makes too many lasers. Here, \r\nDON’T SHOOT ALL THE RAISINS! If you do, The boss goes \r\nberserk and charges at you FAR too fast for you to shoot \r\nit.

Wait for the blue guy to leave and replace the \r\ntarget with another piece of the bomb. Wait for the blue \r\nguy to leave, then go east twice. Read the book on the \r\nright and wait until they come out of the painting. Read \r\nthe book on the right. Run over and switch the face with \r\nthe last part of the bomb. Go south.\r\n\r\nEnd of split in walkthrough. Watch the scene and enter \r\nthe red passage, then the blue passage.\r\n\r\nNuclear Reactors and Bombs Don’t Mix:\r\n\r\nEnter the red passage, then the grey passage.

Take the alarm \r\nclock and smack it on the clay. Now, wrap the whole thing \r\ninto the gym sock. There’s your thermonuke. Happy?\r\n\r\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and ran into \r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\nTouch the item tallyer and pick ‘IT’S OPERATION \r\nTIME!!!!!’. Follow the instructions on the paper I just \r\ntranslated for you. In case you were wondering, if you \r\ndidn’t have all the items that weren’t directly used in \r\nthe making of the nuke, and if you didn’t save Lloyd, \r\nthen some or all of the items would have been destroyed. \r\nEnter the red passage, then the grey passage.\r\n\r\nGo south, west and enter the dark brown passage.\r\n\r\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

Miss out the boulder nearest to the \r\nboulder the bullet will hit first for now. Rotate the gun \r\ntwice and shoot. As soon as the bullet first ricochets, \r\nquickly move the boulder it just hit to the place where \r\nthe boulder you omitted should go. If you don’t get hit \r\nby the bullet, it should hit the target. Enter the blue \r\npassage.\r\n\r\nSAVE! This 3D maze is a nightmare! You’re very lucky I’ve \r\ngot the directions. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll ignore \r\nthe corners. Go left at the T-junction. Take the second \r\nright turn. Take the fourth left turn. Go right at the T-\r\njunction. Take the first left turn, then the first right \r\nturn. Go left at the T-junction. Enter the green passage.\r\n\r\nSave here, like the scroll says. Set the fans as shown in \r\nthe diagram:\r\n\r\n\r\n  P         P\r\n\r\n                          S     M\r\n\r\n  P         P         U\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      M              F\r\n\r\n\r\n                      S   T        U\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   T                            F\r\n                      U\r\n     B                               T\r\n\r\n\r\nP = Preset\r\nS = Set to slow\r\nM = Set to medium\r\nF = Set to fast\r\nT = Set to theory of relativity my butt\r\nU = Leave unset\r\nB = Bullet\r\nT = Target\r\n\r\nPush the bullet right. Talk to AKE and give him your \r\ncheese is the shape of a duck. Plasma launcher? I’m \r\nguessing that’s good. Ask him for a hint for the route \r\nthrough the minefield. Enter the green passage, and it’s \r\ntime to brave the 3D maze again. Once more unto the \r\nbreach, dear friends, once more!\r\n\r\nTake the first right turn. Go left at the T-junction. Go \r\nright at the T-junction. Take the second left turn. Go \r\nleft at the T-junction. Take the second left turn. Go \r\nright at the T-junction. Take the fifth right turn. Go \r\nright at the T-junction. Enter the cyan passage.\r\n\r\nNow, do you remember the directions AKE gave you? No? Oh \r\nwell. Align yourself with the crack in the cliff \r\nhorizontally, then align yourself one square north of it \r\nvertically. Move six squares east, one square north, four \r\nsquares east, two squares north, eight squares east, two \r\nsquares south, five squares east, one square north and \r\nthree squares east. Go east.\r\n\r\nGo through the platform game, touching the arrows to \r\nreverse gravity. There’s no real trick to it, it’s easy, \r\nand writing a walkthrough for it would just waste \r\neveryone’s time. When you reach the end of the cliff on \r\nthe east side of the screen, go east (the blocker should \r\nhave turned into a fake - if it hasn’t, move further east \r\nin the side-scroller). Go towards the portal. You’ll be \r\ntransported somewhere that looks oddly familiar...\r\n\r\nGo east and talk to the Plagiar. Enter the purple \r\npassage. Open the cage door, hit the switch and enter the \r\nbrown passage. Do you remember the Californian raisins \r\nyou fought en route to defeat stale TV specials? You \r\ncould have called this guy as backup. He’ll bounce around \r\nthe screen, spraying bullets everywhere. Shoot him \r\nquickly, but he’ll kill himself in the end. Enter the \r\nblue passage.\r\n\r\nShoot the leftmost and rightmost sections of his nose \r\nthat you can get to through his teeth. He’ll set red \r\nthings on you and his teeth will vanish. Bloody the rest \r\nof his nose and knock out what’s left of his teeth. A \r\nwhite bridge should extent from his nose. Cross it and \r\nenter the nose.\r\n\r\nShoot the centre of the brain three times in quick \r\nsuccession. Brace yourself for a veritable forest of \r\nstars. Cower in fear until its life guage empties. Enter \r\nthe grey passage, then the blue passage.\r\n\r\nIf you pick ‘Yes’ and have 300 points, you get access to \r\nan arena mini-game. Congratulations! You just beat You \r\nvs. Stupidity 2!','','1970-01-01',1,'text',1,NULL,'',''),(163,'File Details','Dr. Dos','Misc','<p>Files uploaded to the Museum of ZZT are categorized by certain details about the content within them.

These can include files such as\r\n    tutorials for ZZT-OOP, toolkits for additional colors, external editors for easier development, or programs to convert music to #play commands to name a few examples. This detail\r\n    also covers ZZT and its clones as they are required to actual play various worlds.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"detail\">\r\n    <a href=\"/zzm-audio\">ZZM Audio</a> - Uploaded files which contain ZZM audio files, a fan created format to share music created in ZZT that can be played in ZZM Players allowing for\r\n    soundtracks to be released and listened to without the use of ZZT itself.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"detail\">\r\n    <a href=\"/featured\">Featured Games</a> - ZZT (and Super ZZT) worlds which stand out among the rest. These worlds showcase the best ZZT has to offer. Featured games are those which have\r\n    received the Feature Game status on z2, or winners of (Classic) Game of the Month awards.

These files are ZIG (ZZT Inspired GCS) worlds which can be played in the ZZT clone, ZIG. ZIG was short lived, and had\r\n    a very limited number of titles released for the platform, but ZIG games were acceptable uploaded on z2, and have thus been grandfathered in to the Museum.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"detail\">\r\n    <a href=\"/contest-worlds\">Contests</a> - Uploaded files which were entries in various ZZTer ran contests.

The only hope of escape is to traverse the forty-five rooms of the game and this time, collect the four \r\npurple keys.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_328.png\' %}\" alt=\"328\">\r\n\r\n<p>The hub format isn\'t actually abandoned, however. Though two of the three paths are locked, the keys are there on the very same screen \r\ngiving the player a chance to open them up after a brief encounter with some lions. For my playthrough, I opted to head east.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_330.png\' %}\" alt=\"330\">\r\n\r\n<p>Following the path leads to a screen with a simple maze containing some centipedes and sliders which much be pushed out of the way to \r\nprogress, as well as a purple key taunting the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_329.png\' %}\" alt=\"329\">\r\n\r\n<p>Heading north in hopes of obtaining the key, instead brings the player to a small section of a larger room, with a series of scrolls \r\nwarning them that touching the alpha is certain death. I touched the alpha. I was instantly killed for it. This is game design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s nothing else you can _do_ with the alpha. You can touch it and die, or ignore it and live.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_331.png\' %}\" alt=\"331\">\r\n\r\n<p>On my second attempt, I opted instead to head into \"The Zapper\", a board where the player is blocked from shooting and instead has to \r\nrely on energizers to make themselves invincible and run into the creatures instead. A lot of what Dungeons does, is tries to make \r\ninteresting scenarios to fight against ZZT\'s default enemies. We\'ll see a lot more like this progressing through the game and \r\nI feel that Dungeons does make very good use of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later on amongst ZZTers, these basic enemies were seen as primitive, and their usage was frowned upon compared to coding your own \r\nenemies instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_333.png\' %}\" alt=\"333\">\r\n\r\n<p>Also of note, is that the lower left corner of the screen contains an invisible maze. I personally never found any fun in mazes like \r\nthis one where there isn\'t any actual danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For completing the Zapper, the player receives the first of the four purple keys.</p>','<style>\r\narticle h2\r\n{\r\ntext-align:center;\r\n}\r\n\r\narticle img\r\n{\r\ndisplay:block;\r\nmargin:auto;\r\n}\r\n</style>','2016-08-15',1,'django',1,NULL,'articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/preview.png','ZZT\'s third official world, and how it compares to Town of ZZT.'),(167,'Closer Look: Dungeons of ZZT','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_334.png\' %}\" alt=\"334\">\r\n\r\n<p>Upon exiting a scroll reminds them to unlock that door ASAP. ZZT only allows the player to carry one of each colored key at a time, so \r\ncontinuing forward to the next purple key would mean lots of backtracking to actually be able to pick it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_336.png\' %}\" alt=\"336\">\r\n\r\n<p>Once again going through the maze by the Zapper, this time heading right, the player will encounter what\'s easily the worst screen in \r\nDungeons.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/dont_miss.gif\' %}\" alt=\"Don\'t Miss!\">\r\n\r\n<p>\"Don\'t miss!\" is right. This screen is a very difficult test in timing, with extreme punishment. If you miss your shot, you\'ll be \r\nattacked from the \"Wrong\" objects, each throwing three player seeking stars, and the door will lock you in when this happens. If you\'re not \r\nclever about things, you\'ll quite possibly lose sixty health! You really need to lead your shots as well, a cycle in ZZT is about 0.1 \r\nseconds, meaning it will take almost 3 seconds from the time you fire your bullet to it hitting the target object.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_337.png\' %}\" alt=\"337\">\r\n\r\n<p>There are ways of mitigating it however. You have enough time to hide in this crevice and usually the stars will die off on their own as\r\ntheir pathfinding isn\'t the best. (With some luck you can even make it behind the door and safely wait it out entirely.) As if this wasn\'t \r\nbad enough, each time you hit the target the objects blocking the exit only move once, meaning multiple hits are required.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_341.png\' %}\" alt=\"341\"> \r\n\r\n<p>If you simply hold down the fire button and wail on the target, the objects tend to get desynced and stuck, forcing a restart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though, it\'s also quite possible to desync the target itself by shooting it after it receives a signal to start moving, but before it \r\nactually does so. This fortunately let me get the object to move to a row where it could be shot, but missing wouldn\'t be recognized.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_345.png\' %}\" alt=\"345\">\r\n\r\n<p>Finally free of that terrible screen, you\'re taunted by yet another purple key. Dungeons really likes doing that.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_346.png\' %}\" alt=\"346\"> <img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_348.png\' %}\" alt=\"348\">\r\n\r\n<p>Dungeons is much more action focused than Town, but it does still have a few actual puzzles. Though compared to Town, they seem both \r\ntamer and less notable. This board is even called \"Another Puzzle\". In the hyper-abstract boards of the original ZZT worlds, a lack of \r\nthings like text labels can make it really difficult to describe a board compared town which has iconic locations like \r\n\"The House of Blues\", \"The Three Lakes\", and \"The Rube Board\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the player is required to do is push some boulders into position so that there\'s a second exit to the main hall, then activate the \r\nbomb and time it to explode over the breakables to be able to access the rest of the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_349.png\' %}\" alt=\"349\">\r\n\r\n<p>One thing definitely worth noting is the sudden appearance of tigers here. Touching the object erases the breakable walls, freeing the \r\nenemies inside. If you go back and count the enemies, you\'ll see eight ruffians, eight lions, and zero tigers, but in this screenshot \r\nthere\'s suddenly an extra ruffian and some tigers. So where are they coming from?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/stats.png\' %}\" alt=\"Stats\">\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a look at KevEdit\'s stat viewer, you can see that there are a lot more stats than expected. If you look closely you\'ll also see \r\nthat a lot of the coordinates repeat themselves, essentially meaning that there are two stats per ruffian. The only ways to accomplish \r\nthis are through corruptions in ZZT\'s editor, or manually hex-editing a world. When two stats share a tile, whatever is in that tile gets \r\nacted upon twice per cycle. It\'s of very limited use since as soon as whatever occupies that tile moves off of it, only one stat gets \r\nupdated, leaving a glitchy empty with stats (dubbed a \"black hole\" by ZZTers) in its place. It\'s a bizarre bug that very rarely comes up \r\nand it\'s interesting to see it occur in one of the original ZZT worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_351.png\' %}\" alt=\"351\">\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing on the path leads to one more puzzle, with a little flavor added by the ever helpful \"Don\'t Blow Yourself Up!\" sign. The \r\npuzzle elements are once again very light, mostly just not getting caught in explosions as you open up more of the board. However there is \r\na bit more to it than that. Due to the required backtracking to get additional red keys as needed, the player will be spending a lot of \r\ntime in the lower area being shot at by spinning guns. Carefully using lit bombs to push others without activating them can greatly reduce \r\nthe danger of this area like so:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_353.png\' %}\" alt=\"353\">\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, as you can see by my health, I also took significant damage regardless.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_354.png\' %}\" alt=\"354\"> <img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_355.png\' %}\" alt=\"355\">\r\n\r\n<p>Exiting the bomb room circles back around to the hallway with the purple key, and this time the player gets to claim their prize. This \r\nis my second purple key, marking the halfway point of the adventure! It took me roughly half an hour to get to this point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, the eastern half of the game is completed, and the only places remaining to explore are the northern and southern paths \r\nin the dungeon\'s main hub. I opted to go south, which took me to a board called Whirlpool.</p>','','2016-08-15',1,'django',2,166,'',''),(168,'Closer Look: Dungeons of ZZT','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_356.png\' %}\" alt=\"356\">\r\n\r\n<p>I did not last! My first death caused by non-alpha related injuries. The Whirlpool is a really good example of creative environments for \r\naction scenes. The player must make several laps around the screen, taking a key to unlock a door, while fighting their way through \r\nduplicating enemies, maintaining a fast enough pace to not get overwhelmed, but also slow enough to be careful not to clear too much forest \r\nand giving the enemies more room to maneuver.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_357.png\' %}\" alt=\"357\">\r\n\r\n<p>One useful trick is that if the player blocks a duplicator, when the duplication process fails, ZZT will act as if the original enemy \r\nhad attacked the player, hurting them, but also destroying itself, allowing the player to shut off a source of enemies if they\'re willing \r\nto take a hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without any more tigers, the board progresses much more smoothly. The ruffians tend to congest the area near their duplicator prevent many \r\nfrom even spawning, and the lions and centipedes have simple behavior that makes them easy to deal with.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_359.png\' %}\" alt=\"359\">\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, by the time I finish the board I realize I missed another mechanic it has, that tends to go underused in ZZT worlds: water! \r\nIf the player enters the whirlpool area itself, they\'ll be able to shoot over the water and safely defeat the enemies without having to get \r\nclose enough to them that they can be attacked themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really enjoy this board and think it\'s one of the best in Dungeons. It does a wonderful job combining the basic elements of ZZT into \r\na fun and exciting challenge. As mentioned earlier, later games would purposely avoid using so many of the things that make this board \r\nmemorable, transporters, keys and doors, forests, water, and default creatures all showcase good usage of \"bad\" elements in the ZZT toolset.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_361.png\' %}\" alt=\"361\">\r\n\r\n<p>Pressing onward to the next section of the dungeons, the DEEP DARK DUNGEONS. Good news, they aren\'t actually dark at all. There are no \r\ndark rooms in Dungeons of ZZT. This, is a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_362.png\' %}\" alt=\"362\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a second blue maze here. Heading east leads to a resupply area with plenty of gems and ammo (and lions), so the player has to \r\nhead west to make progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_365.png\' %}\" alt=\"365\">\r\n\r\n<p>To the west is a free blue key, allowing access to the last exit from the blue maze room. There\'s a nice touch here with moving the \r\nplayer to a board to collect the key rather than just giving it in the maze itself. It adds a bit of foreshadowing knowing of a board \r\nyou\'ve seen, but haven\'t actually been through.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_366.png\' %}\" alt=\"366\"> <img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_367.png\' %}\" alt=\"367\">\r\n\r\n<p>Town of ZZT has an ampersand that gives you some points. This percent sign does absolutely nothing. I have no idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_368.png\' %}\" alt=\"368\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen has this object move across the ricochet area shooting bullets making a sine-wave appear that you have to carefully run \r\nthrough to avoid taking damage. You can\'t shoot on the board so there\'s no alternative to running and hoping.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/mission_status_sick.gif\' %}\" alt=\"Mission Status: SICK\">\r\n\r\n<p>I totally pulled it off on my first attempt and let me tell you I am very proud of how well I held down the left key.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_365.png\' %}\" alt=\"365\">\r\n\r\n<p>Following the path puts you back in this blue key room. I missed grabbing a screenshot on the second pass so you can look at the first \r\nscreenshot again. Avoiding the center area and heading north through the red area brings you to another oddity</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_373.png\' %}\" alt=\"373\"> <img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_374.png\' %}\" alt=\"374\">\r\n\r\n<p>Ok then. I\'ll just take that key and head west.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_375.png\' %}\" alt=\"375\">\r\n\r\n<p>And that leads to the third purple key! This next action sequence contains ricochets, which will reflect your bullets back at you, as \r\nwell as the bullets shot by tigers. It forces the player to keep a closer watch on where they\'re shooting in some already congested areas. \r\nMy sole complaint is that despite the abundance of ricochets, there\'s only one spot where you can make your shots reflect at a 90 degree \r\nangle, shooting safely from around a bend. It\'s a fun mechanic that tends to go underutilized in the player\'s favor.</p>','','2016-08-15',1,'django',3,166,'',''),(169,'Closer Look: Dungeons of ZZT','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_379.png\' %}\" alt=\"379\">\r\n\r\n<p>Moving south this time leads to another board with lots of creatures to shoot. Of note is the cyan ammo object which gives 250 ammo! \r\nIt\'s pretty uncommon to see objects taking on roles that could be fulfilled with prefab elements, but in this case the alternative would be \r\npicking up 50 ammo items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entering the main area causes the purple object to trap you inside, but the player\'s provided more than enough ammunition on this board \r\nalone to handle things if they take their time. The player is rewarded with a red key and can make their way out of this section of the \r\ndungeons.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_365.png\' %}\" alt=\"365\">\r\n\r\n<p>Back to this board again, the player can now enter the X area. Interestingly, the ammo and centipede in the upper left section are \r\ncut off entirely and cannot be accessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_385.png\' %}\" alt=\"385\">\r\n\r\n<p>On the way out, I was mauled by the centipedes as I forgot that this board is marked as one where the player cannot shoot from the \r\nearlier segment with dashing across the ricocheting bullets. I imagine that a lot of other forgetful players take a beating here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heading out takes the player past the blue maze and back through the Whirlpool screen before letting the player return their third \r\npurple key, and proceed to the final northern branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_387.png\' %}\" alt=\"387\">\r\n\r\n<p>And sure enough, right at the start of The Kennel is the fourth purple key!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_408.png\' %}\" alt=\"408\">\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, no, I didn\'t actually skip a whole bunch of content. It\'s a very silly mistake to make though. Of all the key colors to use, \r\npurple is probably the worst choice. Of course if the player takes this route early on, they may be a bit paranoid of using that key as \r\nthere may be two purple keys along the northern branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_388.png\' %}\" alt=\"388\">\r\n\r\n<p>The Kennel itself is some much blander shooting compared to some of the more unique environments seen throughout the rest of the game, \r\nbut could also very well be the first path a player chooses to take. It\'s also very lacking in resources compared to the other paths. If \r\nyou pay attention to my health throughout this playthrough, you\'ll see it goes up and down quite a bit due a good mix of combat and gems.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_390.png\' %}\" alt=\"390\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next board, The Four Stages, is a return to form, breaking up a room into chambers which require the gems to be collected before \r\nbeing able to proceed to the next.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_393.png\' %}\" alt=\"393\">\r\n\r\n<p>And after you complete the three chambers, the fourth springs to life as an object creates a wall and transforms the boulders into \r\ntigers.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_395.png\' %}\" alt=\"395\">\r\n\r\n<p>Following the four stages is this board, with a path locked behind four doors.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/key_machine.gif\' %}\" alt=\"key machine\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen is a fun little puzzle called The Key Machine. The player has to press the buttons to operate the machine and get the \r\nred keys out. It\'s a fun early example of some complex object interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_397.png\' %}\" alt=\"397\">\r\n\r\n<p>Alas, you can still break it...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But perhaps this behavior was noted, the player only needs four red keys to proceed and this puzzle offers them six. If you were so \r\ninclined, a lot of screens use red keys and it\'s possible to exploit this a little bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s plenty of running back and forth between the machine and the room with the doors to unlock. While boards like The Whirlpool \r\ntake advantage of the one key per color limit, in this case it turns into a tedious trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_399.png\' %}\" alt=\"399\">\r\n\r\n<p>Moving past the red doors is the final puzzle, known only as \"Puzzling?\". Unfortunately, it\'s very much not. Simply line up the boulders \r\nso the pushers can move. Dungeons does a much better job with action, but a much worse job with puzzles than Town did.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_404.png\' %}\" alt=\"404\">\r\n\r\n<p>The reward is a purple Z which just says \"ZZT!\" when touched and gives no reward.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_405.png\' %}\" alt=\"405\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen is one seen way back at the start of the game, with the killer alpha. More ricochets and tigers, with some key grabbing \r\nfor good measure. Once again I opted to purposely take a hit to disable a duplicator, in this case getting two for the price of one!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_404.png\' %}\" alt=\"407\">\r\n\r\n<p>And again coming full circle, the player finally obtains the last purple key, which was seen from the very beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the last key in hand, it\'s finally possible to escape from the dungeon!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_412.png\' %}\" alt=\"412\">\r\n\r\n<p>Hitting the switch causes the guard to move out of the way, letting the spinning guns slowly chip away at the walls and open the path to \r\nfreedom. It\'s a bit of a slow process waiting for them to decide to shoot however. The firing rate is actually turned down to two.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_415.png\' %}\" alt=\"415\">\r\n\r\n<p>Heading towards the exit, there\'s a whole lot of ammo that won\'t be needed, and scrolls warning you that you haven\'t actually escaped \r\nfrom the dungeons just yet!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_417.png\' %}\" alt=\"417\">\r\n\r\n<p>The final challenge of Dungeons is to collect all the gems in The Fritz. The board itself is chaotic looking, but other than the three \r\ntigers in the lower right, there\'s no enemies that can escape until you knock down a wall for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_420.png\' %}\" alt=\"420!\">\r\n\r\n<p>Note that my health jumped from 16 to 70. If the player\'s made it this far, they\'ll have no trouble finishing this final board.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_423.png\' %}\" alt=\"423\">\r\n\r\n<p>The penultimate board is a celebration of the player\'s ability. The colorful walls turn into spinning conveyers, and a scroll offers a \r\n10,000 point bonus for escaping. The guards open the gate allowing access to freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/dungeons-of-zzt/zzt_425.png\' %}\" alt=\"425\">\r\n\r\n<p>And so, Dungeons of ZZT comes to a close, with the twist ending that dragons with very long snouts like to play ZZT at their standing \r\ndesks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So how does Dungeons of ZZT compare to Town of ZZT?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, I think it\'s a notable improvement. While the exact order the registered worlds were created is unknown, this at most the \r\nfourth ZZT game ever made. It shows considerable improvements in gameplay, with a lot of very well designed action boards \r\ncompared to Town\'s much more haphazard enemy placement. Many fan made ZZT worlds suffered from poor enemy usage as well, but Dungeons \r\nreally exemplifies how well you can construct an action filled board without the use of a single object. Resources are ample, and you\'ll \r\nlikely finish Dungeons with plenty of ammo. Health is well staggered and it seems like just as you get dangerously low, you\'ll find enough \r\ngems to bring you back to a safe level. Another plus is that at least some of the paths offer exits after getting the purple key, as \r\nopposed to backtracking through cleared boards again. Not every path does this unfortunately, and the paths are much more winding than \r\nTown\'s, allowing you to make a wrong turn on the way out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, then there\'s the target shooting board, which demands a tremendous amount of care for a player who in 1991 has only ever played \r\nTown of ZZT prior to Dungeons. It\'s overly punishing, and demands repeated successes. If not for being able to break it in the player\'s \r\nfavor, it would be possible to render it unwinnable as well. Many of the other puzzles also felt lacking. Town\'s puzzles, I found to be \r\ndifficult but not overwhelming, whereas in Dungeons, everything felt very simplified. Though I don\'t doubt that for many people, the easier \r\npuzzles are seen as a pro and not a con.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, if it\'s 1991 and you spent $6 ($+2 shipping and handling), I\'d say you very much got your money\'s worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>And how does it play today?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Quite well! ZZT\'s gunplay tends to be very poor these days, but there\'s clearly thought put into these action boards rather than just \r\na room with some lions. These boards tend to be more cramped, which makes the enemies more threatening and means you won\'t have to wait \r\nseveral seconds for a bullet to travel across the screen to hit anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where can I get it?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dungeons of ZZT is a part of the official release of ZZT itself.

With the sheer number of abandoned games started \r\nby ZZTers over the years, it\'s a surprise to see this one got one so quickly. It\'s a game I remember playing in my early years of the ZZT \r\ncommunity, and one I can recall enjoying quite a bit. It\'s also pretty short, and as such I\'ll be covering its sequel as well. You\'ll soon \r\nsee that there isn\'t a ton to say about the first game in the Zem! series.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_326.png\' %}\" alt=\"326\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game\'s title screen features a very low contrast dark red on brown logo, but what does pop out is the additional options to learn \r\nabout the game and how to play it by pressing arrow keys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a little more technical, when you load a ZZT world, you don\'t begin playing the world immediately, and instead get to look at its \r\ntitle screen before pressing \"P\" to play. ZZT has some very peculiar ways of handling input, and on the title screen of each world, when \r\nthe game is not in its play state, it replaces the player element with something called a \"monitor\", which is an invisible tile that reacts \r\nto the keys used on the title screen for things like opening the world list, or calling the high score table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that this means is that you\'re always going to have a blank tile on your title screen. (Such as the top left corner of \r\n<a href=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/evlsgdmo.png\' %}\" target=\"_blank\">the title screen from The Evil Saga</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(It also means you can put monitors on boards in normal gameplay, and then if the player presses a key used on the title screen, they\'ll \r\nbe yanked back to it, instantly quitting the game. It\'s very peculiar.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that player in the lower right of Zem!\'s title isn\'t a normal player, but a second \"player clone\" as they tend to be called. Like \r\nmonitors, they have their own strange behavior related to ZZT\'s ways of handling input. Essentially, ZZT always assumes that the first \r\nelement on a board that has stats is either the player, or a monitor. Many functions of the game take advantage of this, such as when you \r\nhave an object \"#go seek\" to move towards the player, it just moves towards the X/Y position of the first stat element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time player clones also use their own stats in certain situations. In this case, attempting to move up or left will make ZZT \r\nrun through its list of elements with stats, something like this when you press left</p>\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"l\">\r\n<li>Monitor -- Do nothing</li>\r\n<li>Player Clone -- Try moving left of your current position, which is blocked, so try sending the element to your left to the \":touch\" \r\nlabel</li>\r\n<li>How to Play object -- Receive \":touch\" event and execute code from there\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>What ends up happening, is that despite the world not being \"played\", it can still be interacted with by using a player clone to touch \r\nobjects!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of more complex ZZT games take advantage of this behavior within the game itself. Some creative use of player clones allowing you \r\nto not only tell which directional arrow the player just pressed, but also detect which direction was just shot in as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_327.png\' %}\" alt=\"327\">\r\n\r\n<p>Sorry for the whole mess of words about monitor and player clones, which in fact have nothing to do with how Zem! is actually played!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zem! is actually a loose interpretation of Lemmings for ZZT. Rather than directly interact with the Lemmings themselves, the player \r\ninstead controls a cursor which can place blocks for Zem to climb over, or be blocked by.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_328.png\' %}\" alt=\"328\">\r\n\r\n<p>And here we see the incredible without context message about bird poop on bridges being mandatory in level seven.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_329.png\' %}\" alt=\"329\">\r\n\r\n<p>A brief disclaimer that this game is in fact not a Psygnosis production! As for Creepers, reading up on it, it sounds more like it\'s a \r\nmore child friendly version of The Incredible Machine. I hadn\'t heard of it prior to this game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_330.png\' %}\" alt=\"330\">\r\n\r\n<p>The author\'s website is advertised, but unfortunately is not available on The Internet Archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_331.png\' %}\" alt=\"331\">\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT\'s limitations are on full display here. Messages of \"Please don\'t do &lt;X&gt;, it\'s cheating\" can be found in a lot of games where \r\nthe behavior of ZZT means a lot of things can be exploited. In this case, ZZT only have a single layer means that the cursor can act as a \r\nwall like any other as far as Zem is concerned, who has no way to be able to distinguish what elements surround him. Similarly, nothing \r\nstops environmental hazards that kill Zem from being able to tell that Zem is what fell onto them rather than your cursor or a wall placed \r\nnext to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_332.png\' %}\" alt=\"332\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s still some rudimentary anti-cheat code! The game checks both that the exit portal is blocked in one direction, and then that Zem \r\nis blocked in the opposite direction to try and verify that you finished a level properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the Pond, zzt.net is partially archived! The domain\'s had quite a life, being used for writing about JavaScript, Ham radios, and \r\nof course ZZT. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20011129083415/http://www.zzt.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Here\'s the ZZT version</a>, which \r\nitself seems like the site was never finished. But it does have a cool animated gif of some ZZT tigers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Picks section mentions their criteria to get your game added and threatens that it will be removed for excessive vulgar language!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_334.png\' %}\" alt=\"334\">\r\n\r\n<p>And so finally, the game can begin proper. This game is non-traditional, relying on what ZZTers would call an engine, a system of \r\nobjects that interact with each other to play ZZT in a way other than the standard \"move the player in four directions\" way of doing \r\nthings.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_336.png\' %}\" alt=\"336\">\r\n\r\n<p>You still control that player, but you\'ll instead be touching objects shaped like arrows to send commands to a plotter object which will \r\nmove accordingly. The controls are a bit awkward in that you have to move down once to be able to reach the down arrow and the button to \r\nplot a bridge. It\'s easy to slip up because of this, but it\'s rarely anything that prevents you from completing a level.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_337.png\' %}\" alt=\"337\">\r\n\r\n<p>Zem moves on his own, climbing over short walls, and turning around when he reaches a tall wall. He moves fairly slowly to make sure \r\nthat the player has time to build their bridges. A lot of Zem! is finishing a level and having to wait for Zem to arrive at his goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_339.png\' %}\" alt=\"339\">\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, get ready to speedrun Zem! because there is very very little to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_341.png\' %}\" alt=\"341\">\r\n\r\n<p>Level 2 makes you use the plotter to create a wall Zem can\'t scale, making him turn around and head to the exit instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_343.png\' %}\" alt=\"343\">\r\n\r\n<p>Level 3 makes you create a staircase for Zem to climb to get to the exit portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_344.png\' %}\" alt=\"344\">\r\n\r\n<p>Level 4 makes you make two bridges.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_345.png\' %}\" alt=\"345\">\r\n\r\n<p>Level 5 is interesting!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_346.png\' %}\" alt=\"346\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_347.png\' %}\" alt=\"347\">\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of plotting, you have to push boulders around to make the bridge for Zem.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_349.png\' %}\" alt=\"349\">\r\n\r\n<p>Level 6 introduces a bird who \"poos\" by shooting a bullet down the screen. Since your bridges are made of breakable walls, they can be \r\ndestroyed by this so you may have to repair the bridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_353.png\' %}\" alt=\"353\">\r\n\r\n<p>It also forgets to change the exit message to the correct level number.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_355.png\' %}\" alt=\"355\">\r\n\r\n<p>Level 7 is the level with required bird poop. Normally the game prevents you from overwriting non-empty tiles, but here you get to use \r\nthe breakable bridges and the bird poop to dig.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_357.png\' %}\" alt=\"357\">\r\n\r\n<p>By turning a tile into a destructible one, it can then be shot away, slowly descending Zem.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_360.png\' %}\" alt=\"360\">\r\n\r\n<p>In the control area of level 8, the game\'s author makes a cameo.

I had to look in the editor to figure it out. It\'s not actually tied to \r\nthe gameplay. There\'s just a dark blue on dark blue passage in the control area you can stumble into with zero hints that it\'s there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I found out in the editor that this was the board with the secret exit I thought it might be something like getting Zem to that \r\nlower left area where there\'s a spot free of spikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a Z that flashes once and never again? I expected it to spell out Zem or something, but it\'s just there for no real \r\nreason.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/zzt_362.png\' %}\" alt=\"362\">\r\n\r\n<p>The solution, is stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zem-and-zem-2/secret.png\' %}\" alt=\"secret\">\r\n\r\n<p>The secret level is a rehash of the first, with a cameo of one of the characters from another Newt game, \"The Punctuation People\".

It\'s definitely an improvement, and going from playing Zem! directly into playing Zem! 2, made \r\nit much more appealing, but standing on its own, it\'s still a pretty weak game, with a fun concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few levels which have some complexity to them, but if you play Zem! 2 you\'ll pretty much just breeze through 90% of it</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How do they play today?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Playing the original Zem! is a bit of a mess. Its sequel is interesting in terms of the engine it uses, but the execution of both games \r\nultimately fall flat. With Zem! 2, you\'ll at least feel like each level is different from the previous even if the solutions still tend to \r\nbe really simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing to note is that Zem! 2 isn\'t actually the last game in the series. There\'s also the \"Zem! 2 Level Pack\", which is a series of \r\nlevels created by other ZZTers, as well as \"Zem! X\", where you play as a lemming hunter who has to capture Zem in each level. Both of these \r\nworlds look to have more well designed levels than the first two games. Perhaps I\'ll take a look at them in the future!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where can I get them?</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"l\">\r\n    <li>Zem! -- <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_zem\" target=\"_blank\">archive.org</a> / <a href=\"http://zzt.org/zgames/z/zem.zip\">z2</a></li>\r\n    <li>Zem! 2 -- <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_zem2\" target=\"_blank\">archive.org</a> / <a href=\"http://zzt.org/zgames/z/zem2.zip\">z2</a></li>\r\n    <li>Zem! 2 Level Pack -- <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_zem2-lvl\" target=\"_blank\">archive.org</a> / <a href=\"http://zzt.org/zgames/z/zem2-lvl.zip\">z2</a></li>\r\n    <li>Zem!

In the past, I had considered using ZZT as a weird way to make entries for the Something Awful Game Dev Challenge \r\n(where you get a month to plan, a month to create) as well as the Ludum Dare itself! Ultimately I never did because I felt like making a \r\ngame for MS-DOS in the second decade of the 21st century seemed like an excellent way to make sure nobody actually played what I\'d make. \r\nThis year though, with Worlds of ZZT being a thing, creating a game went from a silly idea to something actually pretty reasonable, and at \r\nthe very least I could publish it to a small audience on Twitter who at the very least would appreciate that a ZZT game was made in 2016.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who aren\'t familiar with it, the Ludum Dare is a game development \"competition\" in which participants (either solo or in \r\nteams) are given a strict 48 hour time limit to create a game adhering to a topic chosen by a community poll. This is the Compo, the main \r\nevent with judging and everything (well, except this time when they opted to try out not having judging?). Additionally there\'s the Jam, \r\nwhich is extended to 72 hours, no judging, and is much more relaxed. The topic was \"Ancient Technology\" and while ultimately most of that \r\ntheme came from me making a game for a 25 year old Dos program, it wasn\'t my original intention for ZZT itself to be where the theme \r\nadherence came in. I would\'ve had to drastically cut more content if I had opted for the Compo, so when that deadline was drawing near I \r\ndecided to just relax and go with the extra day. Frankly I\'d be amazed if more than one person played my game that didn\'t follow Worlds of \r\nZZT anywhere, and in a world of game jams where 90% of people won\'t get around to playing your game if they can\'t play it in their browser, \r\nadding \"Oh and you have DosBox right?\" seems like another sad hurdle to overcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it had been several years, I at least had the benefit of having made ZZT games on a time limit thanks to the ZZT community\'s own \r\nhistory of 24 Hours of ZZT contests, which are exactly what they sound like. There were also longer Weekend of ZZT contests which match up \r\nwith the Ludum Dare pretty much exactly. And of course, if there\'s one thing you can do with ZZT that you\'ll have a much harder time of \r\nwith Unity, PICO8, Game Maker or any other environment designed to simplify and speed up game development, it\'s the Blitzkriegs. Contests \r\nwhich would be sporadically held on IRC with time limits as low as <span class=\"b\">thirty minutes</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>72 hours wouldn\'t be enough for a masterpiece, but I went in confident I could make something fun, and with some thought put into it vs \r\njust haphazardly placing enemies to shoot.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/1.png\'%}\" alt=\"1\">\r\n\r\n<p>Ruins of ZZT was the result! I went in with zero ideas and wasted several hours just trying to figure out what I wanted to do. The only \r\nthing that came to mind, is that I always wanted to do a ZZT game that used a sword for the player\'s weapon instead of a gun. Plenty of \r\ngames had RPG battles with swords or touching objects when they were char 1 and not char 2 to attack them instead of being hurt yourself, \r\nbut I had always been partial to the sword engine from the ZZT Encyclopedia. I thought it would be a neat way to make fights against ZZT\'s \r\nbuilt in enemies more of a challenge by forcing you to get in close when the usual strategy is to snipe from across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The filename itself was even SWORD.ZZT as I didn\'t have a title yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Ancient Technology\" to me brings up RPG tropes of ancients who had powerful technology but were destroyed and the technology lost. \r\nFinal Fantasy 5\'s <a href=\"http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/SuperNES/FinalFantasyV(J)-CleftOfDimension-Ruins.png\" target=\"_blank\">ruins tileset</a> \r\nespecially comes to mind with its mix of Roman pillars and unexplained pieces of technology like gears, \r\nspinning wheels, and moving chains. It also brings up images of Indiana Jones style temples, full of traps and mysterious artifacts that \r\nbelong in museums. Lastly, it makes me think of Crystalis, since that game begins with you being awakened by a computer in a cave after \r\nbeing sealed away for who knows how long, and promptly receiving a sword which fit the one mechanic I did have in mind at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, I wanted to make a game that felt like one of the original ZZT worlds, primarily Town and Dungeons. I believe the first \r\nidea I came up with was exploring the ruins of the Town of ZZT, and essentially remixing the game (albeit from scratch) with a new path, \r\nand seeing how time ravaged the town. I started making Town\'s final board, with some of the walls crumbled away so you could get inside. \r\nThe last board of Town has a white heart on it which triggers the #endgame command, so I had that there, and when touched some \"faded\" text \r\nwould appear, which contained the default high score table for Town. Problem: I really had no idea what to do with this other than \"oh the \r\nwalls are broken and I guess some lions got loose\". It also didn\'t really integrate well with a sword mechanic if I wanted to use that \r\nsince Town was of course full of shooting a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My next idea was a game about exploring some ancient ruins where just being in their presence prevented modern technology from working. \r\nI had a single intro cutscene started with this, where your guide said that he could take the jeep you were both traveling in no farther. \r\nThe jungle went from a brown dirt road and dark green vegetation to an original ZZT colored yellow road with bright green vegetation as \r\nwell. The plan would be for the player to continue, discover their gun didn\'t work, and have to acquire a sword before they could even \r\nbegin to fight any enemies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I got mad that I was so bad at drawing a jeep in ZZT. Also while the original ZZT worlds made good use of their limited color, \r\nhaving boards filled with blindingly bright green and yellow fakes was destined to look ugly and I wanted to have some reasonable \r\npresentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third idea was the one I ended up going with, something that looked and played like an original ZZT game. I had already considered \r\njust calling it quits, but being on IRC and seeing eevee who opted to dive right in with a PICO8 game based on an existing engine they \r\nalready made, and still only have \"You can move left and right and jump but sometimes the left movement stops working?\" meant that I was \r\nstill ahead in progress by virtue of not having to program movement and collision detection for ZZT\'s player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to take a similar approach and just start making boards, worrying how everything would fit together later, and it didn\'t take \r\nlong before things started coming together.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/4.png\'%}\" alt=\"4\">\r\n\r\n<p>I started with the entrance (and a placeholder board for a menu to go later if needed), deciding that if I was going to do a game with a \r\nsword, I could have acquiring the sword be what locks the player into the ruins, and then similarly to Dungeons of ZZT, require some purple \r\nkeys to be able to make it back out once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn\'t have a plot, but liked the idea of the ZZT Player themself being the same as the original, and frankly, the same white on blue \r\nsmiley face in every single ZZT game ever made. ZZT is old, and most people haven\'t really touched it in at least a decade (and even that\'s \r\nbeing generous). I liked the idea of the ZZT Player themself feeling as if they hadn\'t been on an adventure in years, and wrote my opening \r\nexposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The opening is very overwrought, trying to explain to an audience playing the game what 25 years of ZZT has been in just a dozen or so \r\nsentences. The intro mentions that the ZZT Player has conquered dungeons, explored distant planets, dealt with political espionage, and \r\nworked fast food, and how those experiences influenced each adventure that came afterward. Dungeons is explicitly a reference to Dungeons \r\nof ZZT, the distant planets can be quite a large number of them, and the political espionage and fast food coming from two of the most well \r\ndesigned ZZT games I can think of, Evil Sorceror\'s Party and Burger Joint. Both games which I\'m absolutely going to have to cover at some \r\npoint. (One of the last threads posted on z2 is even \"you will never play Burger Joint for the first time again\")</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway! Once you pick up your sword, the lion statues spring to life and must be defeated before the gate to the main hub of the ruins \r\nopens. The ZZT Player mentions how the lions staggered pretty aimlessly, a reference to the fact that while you can adjust how well enemies \r\nin ZZT move towards the player vs. moving randomly, you can only do so when placing them in the editor. These statues #become lion and as \r\nsuch are locked into using the default stats for a lion, which is an intelligence stat that\'s dead centered. The plaque on the sword \r\nexplains your goal of obtaining purple keys. It also mentions the game being themed like something from 1995, a deliberate change from 1991 \r\nas I was incorporating more use of objects and extended colored graphics! I had intended for there to be 5 keys but it didn\'t take long \r\nbefore I realized that would be way too many for my time limit, and dropped it to three. It was nearly dropped to two on the final day!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the gate and ZZT Player commentary were originally going to be more involved throughout the game. I liked the idea of using the \r\nexperienced ZZT Player as a narrator who could point out the ZZT engines limitations. I believe there was originally going to be some \r\ndialog about the sword being bullets with limited range at some point. Gates would serve as a simple way to force encounters with enemies, \r\nbut honestly a dozen boards of shooting lions didn\'t sound like much fun to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also added the cyan area with the gems and key right away. Dungeons had a lot of twisting paths where you\'d see things from one \r\nsection of the board but be unable to access it until you find another entrance to the board. I wanted to incorporate this more as well, \r\nthough the game turned out to be very linear in terms of getting from one board to another. I think this is the only board you actually do \r\nhave to visit a second time to access everything on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/5.png\'%}\" alt=\"5\">\r\n\r\n<p>The hub came next. I wasn\'t sure exactly how I wanted to lay things out, especially since I had no idea what kind of boards I would \r\nhave. I decided to lock away a corridor with a readily available key to introduce the key/door mechanic. I threw in some centipedes since \r\nthey work well at having something moving on the screen that doesn\'t feel particularly dangerous, and works as a nice softball for the \r\nplayer to hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a green cent sign that gives a single gem and point and serves zero purpose. I was going to put more things like this throughout \r\nthe game but never really thought to. Town has an \"Ampersand\" that gives bonus points, and Dungeons has a \"Percent\" that does nothing. (The \r\nAmpersand if I recall is actually named \"Necklace\" in the code. I suppose Tim decided to make things more abstract for the fun of it.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I eventually added a sign to give the player some insight as to where they\'d be headed. Looking at it now, you need a gem to actually do \r\nanything to the north, and a key to the east, so I\'m guessing most people went south first which was the first room I made.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/6.png\'%}\" alt=\"6\">\r\n\r\n<p>The classic ZZT worlds have a lot of named boards with text on the screen. The idea of a greenhouse with a gardener came to mind and so \r\nI ran with it. I had messed around with just drawing some random shapes in the editor and liked the appearance of diagonal running green \r\nwalls. I added the water and bridges and realized that the club and spade character were often used in ZZT as trees, so if I used green \r\nruffians I\'d be able to fit the theme of the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally I was going to be hesitant to use special colors (in ZZT\'s default editor ruffians _have_ to be bright purple). I went with \r\ndark green over bright to add contrast to the walls. I don\'t think \"enemy contrast\" was something I had ever considered when making ZZT \r\ngames in the past, but a lot of color choices in the game were designed with contrast in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One issue I ran into was that if your sword bullet had to be erased, it would take out any water it was over or fake walls it was on top \r\nof. The fake walls ultimately didn\'t matter, but you can make a path through the water this way. I considered dropping the sword mechanic \r\nat this point, as it meant I couldn\'t really use water very well, or anything in ZZT that could shoot bullets. I was lazy and didn\'t want \r\nto have to worry about providing the player with enough ammo as well so I decided to just roll with it. It\'s not a ZZT game if the player \r\ndoesn\'t have to abide by the honor system to not break things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t know if people realized the roses could be shot and destroyed, and probably should have made the purple flowers destroyable \r\nthemselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I added the gardener who needed to be bribed to be let in, similar to the bridge troll in Town. I thought about having him then trap you \r\ninside until you got some item for him again like Town\'s troll, but decided I didn\'t want to force the player to commit to a path if they weren\'t up to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also I like my use of slashes to make a white picket fence for the Great Oak (tm).</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/7.png\'%}\" alt=\"7\">\r\n\r\n<p>The lower half of the Great Oak (tm) was a lot of fun to make. I thought of the idea of blasting through sap with red \"apple bombs\" as a \r\nway to keep a theme going. Town of ZZT has a puzzle just like this, but much more brutal. Instead of grubs, objects begin shooting stars at \r\nthe player, which are indestructible projectiles that always move towards the player. Stars eventually fizzle out, but the objects keep \r\nproducing more, and they can also push bombs as they move towards the player, so it\'s very easy to make that screen unbeatable. It\'s also \r\nimpossible to beat without triggered at least one of the star throwers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to make sure that my screen was beatable without taking any damage. I also wanted to make sure that the player knew how big the \r\nexplosions would be! Bombs hardly get used in ZZT as is, but anybody completely new to the game would have no idea how large the explosions \r\nare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think you\'d have to do a very poor job to not make it through with six bombs, but just in case I added the blue beetle character \r\n(after looking up what the heck grubs turn into) as a way to restock the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can make them mad if you hit him with two bombs, in which case he erases the sap and all the maggots hatch. This also makes them \r\nunfriendly in the game\'s final battle, when I came up with the idea of having friends that can help you.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/8.png\'%}\" alt=\"8\">\r\n\r\n<p>I thought about having a boss fight in the oak section, and a spider came to mind as something appropriate for that. I googled for ascii \r\nspider which is where I got those graphics from as well as the webs. I made up the gardener questline on the spot and had an idea \r\noriginally for you to take her with you and plant her on his back.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/9.png\'%}\" alt=\"9\">\r\n\r\n<p>But then I had introduced \"Apple bombs\" into the game\'s lore. I like the complete lack of scale in the oak segment. The first apple \r\nbombs are as big as you are, but these ones are massive. The spider queen is huge compared to you now, but in the final boss fight she\'s no \r\nlarger than you are. At the same time as tiny you drops giant apples, the greenhouse cam shows regular sized you dropping regular sized \r\napples. It was fun to not worry about things having to make sense. I got a lot of vibes I had gotten before when making Mario Maker levels \r\nwhere I had a theme in mind, but the actual stage elements didn\'t matter towards that theme. (See: \r\n<a href=\"https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/3CF9-0000-00DA-AC8E\" target=\"_blank\">Welcome to Warp Zone</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting the large apple bombs to animate properly was a pain. At first I was going to make them out of objects. ZZT has issues with a \r\nbunch of objects that are connected to each other moving, but the effect looked even worse than I remembered. Then I was going to use \r\ninvisible walls to reveal frames of animation, but realized I couldn\'t just make the apples on the tree red solid walls because they\'d all \r\nbe caught when I only wanted to make one invisible. Ultimately I had to use dark red on dark red boulders and sliders as a way to get three \r\napples on screen and individually accessible in ZZT-OOP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenhouse Cam makes me think of Wayne\'s Worlds Get-a-load-of-this-guy Cam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In retrospect, I should\'ve made the apples \"regrow\", since this board violates my \"no softlocks allowed\" rule. There\'s at least plenty \r\nof warning to save, and the spider explicitly tells you you\'ll get a purple key so hopefully nobody thought it was optional!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/10.png\'%}\" alt=\"10\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next section I did was the eastern path. In Dungeons it was pointed out to me that there was a board with various items to collect \r\nin one section of the board, but the other section you\'d access later had enemies coming from duplicators, which would get a head start if \r\nthe player was collecting items early on. I liked the concept of the player needing to realize that they shouldn\'t collect items until \r\n_after_ completing the rest of the board. So I started to make a board where the player would have to move quickly and not want to waste any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\'s why I put an invisible maze in! Normally, invisible walls in ZZT just show up with touched. A common adjustment to this is to \r\nmake an object check for a revealed wall, and then make the whole maze flash instead. It\'s significantly less frustrating this way. \r\nInvisible mazes (or visible ones) still tend to be rather pointless, but I was hoping mine would be small enough and have purpose added to \r\nit with the duplicators slowly producing more lions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At one point I put a spinning gun in the lower left segment, but then remembered that due to the sword engine, I wouldn\'t really be able \r\nto use them!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a hard time balancing this board since I didn\'t want there to be too many lions. I opted on the side of caution since I didn\'t \r\nwant complaints that nobody could finish the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also believe I made a mistake with my choice of key colors and not having a colorblind option for the game period. A later board \r\noffers one, but I didn\'t think of it for here. Even if you\'re not colorblind it can be very difficult to read the door colors. (At the very \r\nleast I could\'ve used special colored doors that better matched the key instead of ZZT\'s default mostly white ones)</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/11.png\'%}\" alt=\"11\">\r\n\r\n<p>I just thought it would be fun to hype up this area of the game. It\'s sealed behind a locked door, and that room itself is also sealed \r\naway. Something to make it seem like the underground was a dangerous and scary place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also had absolutely zero ideas for what the underground would be when I made it. At one point I was going to have a picture of the \r\nplayer (by which I mean a large white on blue smiley face) \"holding\" a torch, descending the staircase. I couldn\'t really get it to look \r\nsatisfactory so I just axed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/12.png\'%}\" alt=\"12\">\r\n\r\n<p>The underground storage area as it\'s called in the editor was a way to show off a more classical puzzle. While most of the game I tried \r\nto prevent the player from rendering it unwinnable (without cheating at least), there\'s no practical way to do this with a slider puzzle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slider puzzles, are a tremendous pain to make. You don\'t want them to be too difficult, but you also don\'t want them to be something the \r\nplayer can just breeze through without stopping to think about what actions they\'re taking. Ultimately, I\'m dissatisfied with it. Every \r\ntweak I\'d make to prevent an easy solution tended to break something else. The intended solution is to walk the player down the left column \r\nof crates, push the yellow sliders up to pin the key against the northern wall, then push the key out to the top left corner while making \r\nsure you had a clear path backwards to be able to pick up the key and also leave the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can basically ignore 99% of that and grab the key right away and just push like 2 blocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last chamber\'s puzzle is one I always remember from ZZT because a lot of games seemed to use it for some reason. I think it\'s used \r\nin A Link to the Past as well which is probably where everyone stole it from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I made the filename warning to really hammer home that you don\'t want to trap yourself here. Then, when my lousy puzzle was done I added \r\nthe message that it\'s not as scary as it looks. I should have used a non-cyan key here as well since it can blend in among the boulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/zzt_462.png\'%}\" alt=\"Dark\"><br>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/13.png\'%}\" alt=\"13\">\r\n\r\n<p>Alone In the Dark is hands down the most complex board in the game, and the one I had to spend the most time on! I came up with the idea \r\nof fighting white versions of enemies as \"ghosts\", and wanted to play up how in ZZT dark rooms are generally really bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So first let\'s talk about the left half of the room with the ghost. My original plan was to just have a dark corridor the player would \r\ntravel through before reaching the action half of the screen and time things so the torch would run out on them and they\'d have to press on \r\nblindly for a little bit before getting more torches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem I ran into with this was that the player could stumble around in the darkness for a bit _before_ lighting their torch. I \r\nneeded something that could stagger the player\'s progress and be able to ensure that they were in fact in the dark without any torches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The invisible ghost blocks the player and won\'t appear until they\'re aligned and also checks that the player is out of torches. The box \r\nwas placed to be certain that the player had to have picked up the torch in order to make it to the ghost in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then he has his little speech, and asks if you trust him. Originally I considered having not trusting the ghost lead to a more difficult \r\naction sequence later on, but decided against having too much emphasis on an arbitrary choice of the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the ghost appears to push a tiny light source around as the player now slowly makes their way to the second half of the room. Most \r\nthings in darkness in ZZT just don\'t get rendered at all. Only passages, the player, and torches will show up. A (I believe unused) very \r\nlate era concept in ZZT known as \"the kangaroo effect\" (obviously) involves putting statless passages around the outsides of your walls in \r\ndark rooms. This makes it so that in the dark you can still tell where you\'re heading by essentially giving a visible in the dark outline. \r\n(It got that name when somebody suggested it as a joke, and a young me said \"That\'s canon now.\" Don\'t give 16 year olds power ever.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So torches show up. I thought it would be really cool to have the ghost push a torch around and the player would follow it and I thought \r\nit would be a very unique effect. I programmed the whole sequence, tested it out, and whoops, torches for whatever reason aren\'t marked as \r\nsomething that can be pushed! They act like walls to objects. Talking on Twitter, the best guess for why this was the case was to make \r\nhandling the rendering of dark rooms easier to code for since the player is the only thing that shows up in darkness that can move or be \r\nmoved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really felt I had a good concept and tried to come up with an alternative. The obvious one, would be to have the object walk the path, \r\nconstantly #putting a torch down and #putting an empty before each step. I didn\'t want to deal with making my code balloon like that. The \r\nghost takes almost 100 steps in his path, and I couldn\'t just use ZZT\'s #walk command with it because being blocked by the torch would make \r\nit think the object hit a wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Players however, do show up. I could have the ghost place a player clone and shove the clone around, but then there\'s the issue with due \r\nto how movement is processed in ZZT, moving in a direction a player clone isn\'t blocked will cause the real player to teleport to that \r\ntile. Clones are \"sticky\" like that, plus player clones are always white on blue, which I guess could be considered following the ghost in \r\ndarkness, but wasn\'t the effect I wanted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However you can use players without stats! ZZT stores its boards first as a series of tiles, and then after the room data, it stores the \r\n\"stats\". Coordinates and information on tiles located at that position. Through external tools its possible to erase stats, which in most \r\nsituations is pretty useless. A passage without stats for instance, means it doesn\'t have a destination board set and defaults to board 0, \r\nthe title screen. A lion without stats will just sit there, never moving because ZZT doesn\'t know that there\'s something that it should \r\nmove there. The player can still interact with it, walking on it to be hurt by it like a regular lion as ZZT runs its player updating code \r\nand sees they touched a lion, or that a bullet hit one to destroy it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT has a stat limit of 150 stats per board as a way to conserve memory, but since removing stats usually means removing the soul (if \r\nyou\'re feeling philosophical) or the sprite.update() function call (if you\'re feeling programmatical), its not something that really has \r\nmuch purpose. There are only two real exceptions to this, and both typically used to serve the same purpose: statless players and stateless \r\nobjects. These both have been used in various ZZT games to make \"crowds\" without hitting the object limit. If you wanted an arena or \r\nconcert hall filled with objects in the audience, you\'d hit the stat limit even though those objects don\'t need to do anything. By removing \r\nthe stats, you basically get a wall. These are usually called \"Dummies\" or \"Dumdums\" or in the case of KevEdit, you can place a \"Dead \r\nSmiley\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A statless player means you\'ll have something that shows up in the dark, and can also be black on black, matching the empty floors the \r\nplayer moves around on! So, the ghost is pushing dead bodies around as light sources. They can\'t go around corners, so at each corner a \r\ndumdum is shot by the ghost and removed, and the next one leads the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sadly meant that each corner would have a visible space at all times, which would stick out like a sore thumb in darkness. There\'s \r\nno way to produce a dead smiley via ZZT-OOP meaning they had to be there in advance. So I also slapped down a bunch of them in unreachable \r\nareas to add a bit of visual noise to it. It also means the basement is full of dead players. Spooky!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After reaching the end of the main path and being left in darkness by the ghost, the player goes through a transporter they never knew \r\nwas there and suddenly are warped to the far right side of the screen. An object detects their presence and closes away the transporter \r\nback. The player is now unable to move in complete darkness! This is about as survival horror as ZZT gets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ghost reveals it was all a bad joke, and gives you some torches. If you trusted the ghost he also gives you a flashlight which gives \r\nan additional 200 torches, so no need to worry about running out in the rest of the board, though the amount given in general should be more \r\nthan enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The action area was originally going to have duplicators that didn\'t activate until you were in the right half of the screen, but they \r\nwere giving me a lot of trouble and I cut them out. There\'s an object that plays music that\'s just silence on this board, muting \r\neverything, including the duplicators that no longer exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graves were positioned in such a way to prevent false positives with the player or lions stepping on them, while also allowing the \r\nplayer to exit if they accidentally did travel into one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some very frustrating reason, the lower left grave refuses to work! Its code is identical to the others except for the direction to \r\ncheck for a boulder being different, but it just won\'t go. I have absolutely no idea why this happens, and it kind of ruins the board a \r\nbit. You won\'t get a message for pushing a boulder on it, and you also never get a \"You did it!\" message for covering up all the graves. \r\nI had to actually cheat the coding and as soon as you walk into the grave area, the game erases the wall the lower left grave is supposed to \r\nerase. So, in reality you only need to cover the other three graves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This board took up a ton of time to make, and definitely has its ZZT quirks, but I\'m really happy with how it turned out, and to my \r\nknowledge no other game used dead players as a light source!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/14.png\'%}\" alt=\"14\">\r\n\r\n<p>At this point I had enough done that I thought it might be wise to start making a manual for it, in case people who never played ZZT \r\ngave the game a shot. I didn\'t want them to be completely lost. Recently eevee played ZZT for the first time ever, started with Town and \r\nthen moving to Ruins for their second game. They completely ignored the signs on the board as Town made them all clear enough, but maybe \r\none day this board will help somebody.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/15.png\'%}\" alt=\"15\">\r\n\r\n<p>By this point, I was on the last day with maybe 7 hours left, plus needing some final testing and bugfixing. I tried to think of what to \r\ndo for the third path that would be unique, and not take forever to make. I thought about using this path as a way to introduce people to a \r\nmore complex engine than the sword one currently in use. Something where the player wouldn\'t really be the focus of gameplay, but instead \r\njust touching objects to manipulate whatever the real focus would be. I considered some sort of racing minigame where you\'d have to steer a \r\ncar object around a track for a few laps and beat a time to get the last purple key. I also considered a simple game where you\'d control a \r\nship and shoot at enemies along the lines of Space Invaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wound up going with something more original (to me at least, I\'m sure there\'s a game with these mechanics out there). The Blue Beetle \r\nClimb simply involves an object that walks back and forth up the mountain, checking for solid ground underneath themselves when there needs \r\nto be a bridge instead of a pit. One nice thing about how this worked is that \"falling\" into a pit didn\'t make the object actually move \r\nsouth into it, so it was easy to have the object walk west until they hit a wall, then walk south until they hit another wall and know the \r\nobject was in the bottom left corner. This made it simple to reset the game and continue avoiding softlocks. I enjoyed making the flag \r\nplanting animation when the mountain was conquered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After picking the colors for the bridges, which were chosen to not blend in with the green of the mountain, I realized red, purple, and \r\nyellow might be difficult to tell apart for some people. Ever since I watched a colorblind friend play through Super Metroid and be unable \r\nto tell which doors needed Super Missiles and which needed Power Bombs I\'ve tried to make things colorblind friendly! In this case, the how \r\nto play section of the game offers a colorblind mode which makes the bridges change into A/B/C characters and highlights which button will \r\nmove which letter, removing color from the equation entirely. I regret that I did not do a good job of this with the keys in the eastern \r\npath. Whoops.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/16.png\'%}\" alt=\"16\">\r\n\r\n<p>With all three keys, the player can leave the ruins and travel across this weird rainbow path leading into space? However, after passing \r\na certain point the Gardener reappears! He is angry at what you did to him and forces you into the final boss fight. A passage appears and \r\nthe player is sent to the final battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/17.png\'%}\" alt=\"17\">\r\n\r\n<p>Well! This is certainly not what people who played the game saw! I really wanted to do an over the top RPG battle that ZZTers and MZXers \r\nalike were always putting in their games. The layout is based on Final Fantasy 1 here. The battle was essentially going to be rigged, \r\nmaking it so the player would always win. At the same time, how you treated the three characters would decide if they had magic or not. \r\nMagic in these sort of engines tends to be flashing invisibles that appear on the screen to simulate fire, ice, lighting, whatever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I simply did not have the time left to finish this, especially with how long it had been since I made one of these things, and that \r\nI was being fancy with an object based system for selecting attacks rather than just popping up a text box with choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are tools to convert mod music to ZZT\'s #play format (though quite a bit is lost in any conversion), and I was hoping to also find \r\nsomething like FF7\'s One Winged Angel, or Undertale\'s Megalovania to really hammer home how silly a grand RPG finale in ZZT really is. \r\n(I mean, maybe Undertale isn\'t all that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE3m3uzvVXM\" target=\"_blank\">unlikely</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/18.png\'%}\" alt=\"18\">\r\n\r\n<p>This board is in fact titled \"The scaled down real final battle\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here\'s the thing with ZZT\'s combat for boss fights like this: There\'s really not a whole lot you can do. Object movement is either going \r\nto be random, towards the player, or pre-determined. Since shooting the object will make it jump to the :shot label in its code, you\'ll \r\nhave to restart its attack pattern with another label jump, so if you had an object move in a circle with /n/s/e/w to move north, south, \r\neast, and then west, shooting it in the middle of this cycle would make it start over at north.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One on one fights generally don\'t work out so well. Combined with a lack of time limit, and this is what I came up with on short notice. \r\nMore lions. A boss that was invincible and you had to wait out. Friends who walk across the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blue beetle shows up first, and \"slows those lions down\", which doesn\'t actually slow the existing lions down. It actually makes the \r\nstatues take longer to produce more lions. It\'s possible to upset the blue beetle and have them reject you if you bombed them a few times \r\nin the sap section of the oak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ghost shows up next, and if you trusted him, you get 200 health. Having seen two other people play through the game, it definitely \r\ndumps too much health on the player, but then that\'s one way to make sure they\'ll make it to the end I suppose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly is the spider queen. There\'s no way to upset her as you have to hit the gardener in the first place to win her favor. There\'s not \r\neven a flag set. She turns the block in the middle into a bomb so the fight can actually come to an end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bombs in ZZT, and everything else, disappear when they explode. But ZZT has them linger for a cycle when the explosion happens so it\'s \r\npossible to check for breakables to detect the explosion, and then change the bomb into a bomb, and the breakables into empties, creating \r\nan infinite use bomb! I was having issues getting everything to work properly, as for some reason this method causes objects to be sent to \r\n:bombed twice. I would up just doubling the labels, so looking at the code the Gardener should take five hits from bombs to defeat, but in \r\nreality it only takes three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final hit changes the explosion to fake walls and freezes the gardener in place. It\'s meant to be a cinematic sort of freeze frame \r\nof him caught in the explosion. It turns out it\'s possible for the timings of all this to be slightly off and for the bomb to disappear and \r\nthe Gardener to not die as I learned in eevee\'s playthrough!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/making-the-ruins-of-zzt/19.png\'%}\" alt=\"19\">\r\n\r\n<p>And that\'s the game! The \"Game Over - Press Escape\" message is overwritten by an object spamming a link to the Worlds of ZZT Twitter \r\nrepeatedly, which makes it flicker and look strange to people not familiar with ZZT\'s lack of a custom game over message. You also receive \r\na final 5000 bonus points if you\'ve befriended everybody. I wanted the colors of the text to change, but ZZT also speeds up the game \r\nimmensely in the game over state, so to do so, I put the object at cycle 50. For reference, the default cycle for objects is 3. Built in \r\nenemies move at cycle 2, and the Player moves at 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making a ZZT game in 2016 was a ton of fun! I\'m a bit disappointed I didn\'t really stick to the theme outside of making a ZZT game since \r\nI planned to make a ZZT game regardless of the theme. If I\'m around for more Ludum Dares, I\'d love to give it another shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heck, I\'d love to make more ZZT games in general. It\'s very relaxing compared to making games in a traditional programming language.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>And How Does It Play Today?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully very well. I mean, it\'s barely a week old by the time this article goes live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I may be biased though!

Rather than the typical Tolkein fantasy world of elves and orcs, Testa sets his game \r\nin what was then present day New York City\'s subway system. Of course, if there\'s one thing high fantasy and New York City have in \r\nabundance, it\'s a lot of rats to fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game\'s title screen links to www.anthonytesta.com (which is no longer around), the Internet Archive has a few versions of the site, \r\nwith not a whole lot there, but enough to learn that Testa is indeed a NYC native.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_001.png\'%}\" alt=\"001\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game opens to all the background the player will be given. You\'re in a New York subway, and an urban hero to conquer the urban \r\nwarlock Shigesato who has taken over the subway system. It\'s an urban game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_002.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player is given control in a tiny room with three essential items, a toilet; your baseball bat, which serves as your main weapon \r\nthroughout the game; and a baseball cap, which you distinctly wear backwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_007.png\'%}\" alt=\"007\">\r\n\r\n<p>The world of Deep December is compact, yet full of little details. Nearly every object can be examined by touching it. Seats, \r\nturnstiles, statues, and even Coke machines can be investigated.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_008.png\'%}\" alt=\"008\">\r\n\r\n<p>Talking with a bum on one of the seats gives you the game\'s instructions. You can attack in melee with the bat by just touching an \r\nenemy. Once you find a gun, you\'ll be able to pick up ammo as well and shoot bullets like a traditional ZZT game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_011.png\'%}\" alt=\"011\">\r\n\r\n<p>The flashlight mechanic is introduced as well. Your torches represent your batteries. The rest of the game will take place in dark \r\nrooms, and the player is required to keep themselves stocked up on torches by finding batteries or a recharging station which will set \r\ntheir torches to five.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_015.png\'%}\" alt=\"015\">\r\n\r\n<p>Moving along the path, the player will pick up a flashlight and then have to pay most of their money to enter the subway system. Even \r\nwhen it\'s been taken over by an urban warlock, NYC\'s got to be able to make money off it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_196.png\'%}\" alt=\"196\">\r\n\r\n<p>For the sake of readability, I\'ll be posting these pictures of the boards taken from ZZT\'s editor so that you can see the whole thing at \r\nonce. In reality, you\'re limited to a tiny radius of light provided by your torch, and most gameplay looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_017.png\'%}\" alt=\"017\">\r\n\r\n<p>Darkness is ZZT is usually implemented poorly, but I did play through the whole game with the lights out and the darkness works out \r\nnicely here.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_018.png\'%}\" alt=\"018\">\r\n\r\n<p>The first room in the subway offers quite a lot. Firstly, a water fountain. The player can drink from these once to restore some health. \r\nSecond, is the doctor. Pay them for a check-up and your health will be reset to 100. Lastly, the yellow arrows are battery recharge \r\nstations. They can be used an infinite number of times, but the game does a good enough job pacing batteries that you\'ll likely never \r\nactually be in danger of running out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s still quite a nice feature to include though! The player can ease up on how fast they try to get around knowing they won\'t ever \r\nbe stuck in darkness.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_025.png\'%}\" alt=\"025\">\r\n\r\n<p>A friendly homie (that\'s the object\'s name) offers you some advice for talking with them. Some basic rules to live by:\r\n    <ul class=\"l\">\r\n        <li>\"Shootin\' oil barrels makes oil spill.\"</li>\r\n        <li>\"You need microwave to heat up TV dinners\"</li>\r\n        <li>\"Give Asmodeus the rose to defeat him.\"</li>\r\n        <li>\"Stay cool, brother.\"</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are oil barrels throughout the subway system. Unlike most barrels in video games which would explode or spill flammable liquid, \r\nall shooting a barrel does here is creates some breakable walls. There\'s no real purpose to shooting them since you\'ll just need to shoot \r\naway the walls afterwards. Though, in theory you could trap an enemy in the liquid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TV dinners are found in the dungeons and can be heated up to give you some health if you can find a microwave. You won\'t find any \r\npotions of healing in the New York City subway system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asmodeus isn\'t in Deep December, but one of Testa\'s other games. Good to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_031.png\'%}\" alt=\"031\">\r\n\r\n<p>The turnstile spins when it\'s touched. A fun little detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_199.png\'%}\" alt=\"199\">\r\n\r\n<p>Taking the southern exit leads to this room which immediately contains a statue shaped like a 7, a microwave, and some bullets that must \r\nbe left behind until the player obtains a gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_035.png\'%}\" alt=\"035\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player won\'t have time to investigate immediately, as a pack of roaches attack! They go down easily, a single hit defeated them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the lower left corner, the player can find a candy bar for 15 health.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_042.png\'%}\" alt=\"042\">\r\n\r\n<p>The lower right corner contains a turret which moves up and down, shooting bullets to the west that the player will need to dodge in \r\norder to approach it until they can smash it with their bat.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_044.png\'%}\" alt=\"044\">\r\n\r\n<p>Moving up ahead, the next enemy type is encountered: Urban zombies. They don\'t really do much of anything. They don\'t move until you \r\ntouch them and get that same message every time, and then you can just touch them a second time immediately to defeat them. It very much \r\nseems to defeat the purpose since they wind up being almost completely harmless.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_045.png\'%}\" alt=\"045\">\r\n\r\n<p>When you defeat one, they leave behind some green blood. This is done by placing a forest tile and changing it to a fake wall before the \r\nobject dies. It\'s a weird technique required to get some of the non-standard ZZT colors created during gameplay.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_200.png\'%}\" alt=\"200\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_047.png\'%}\" alt=\"047\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next room has a few more mechanics introduced. There\'s a broken recharger on the wall. These are found throughout the subway system \r\nand give a one time bonus to the player\'s torch count. This lets you get more torches than you\'d normally be able to hold as regular \r\nrechargers set your torches to five every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_049.png\'%}\" alt=\"049\">\r\n\r\n<p>A water fountain makes its appearance as well. Like the broken rechargers they can only be used once, though in this case it\'s not that \r\nthe water is limited, just that the player states they aren\'t thirsty anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_052.png\'%}\" alt=\"052\">\r\n\r\n<p>Up ahead is the first mini boss, a subway shaman who sends roaches after you when you get close before he begins his own attacks which \r\ninvolve shooting at the player who at this point won\'t have a gun. Fortunately the shaman isn\'t that difficult to defeat despite their \r\nsuperior weaponry.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"054\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player is well rewarded for defeating the shaman, receiving a TV dinner which can be taken to a microwave for 20 health, a wad of \r\ncash equal to 4 gems, and a pistol, albeit one without any ammunition.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_059.png\'%}\" alt=\"059\">\r\n\r\n<p>Above the shaman\'s lair is a locked gate and your torch will provide just enough light to see some ammo and the elevator to the next \r\nlevel below.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_060.png\'%}\" alt=\"060\">\r\n\r\n<p>Without the key the player will need to turn back to the very beginning and take the northern route instead. Unfortunately, during my \r\nfight with the shaman, a bullet was shot that managed to hit a barrel, spreading breakable walls when I didn\'t yet have any way to destroy \r\nthem. This oversight trapped me and I had to cheat for ammo to break through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when you have ammo, shooting oil barrels is pretty meaningless and their purpose in the game seems unclear. I suppose I\'m only \r\nbasing it on other games where \"shoot the barrels\" is a good thing, but it really does nothing but punish the player to use their ammo \r\nhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Backtracking gives the player a chance to pass the microwave again, this time with a TV dinner in hand for some healing and ammo to now \r\ncollect.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_064.png\'%}\" alt=\"064\">\r\n\r\n<p>Heading north from the starting area of the subway leads to an ambush of rats sent by a strange man who then runs away from you to be \r\nfought later.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_065.png\'%}\" alt=\"065\">\r\n\r\n<p>An alcove to the side offers another TV dinner and some ammo, along with this graffiti and an urban zombie sitting in a plastic chair \r\nuntil they player interacts with them. Interestingly, even if the player shoots the zombie, there\'s no reaction. If the player doesn\'t \r\ntouch them, the zombies in Deep December will never wake up. I feel like the risk of awakening a zombie in some crossfire would\'ve helped \r\nmake them a bit more threatening at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_197.png\'%}\" alt=\"197\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_067.png\'%}\" alt=\"067\">\r\n\r\n<p>The northern path opens with a smashed glass bottle which at first I thought was supposed to be a pile of bones. This is the sort of \r\nmisinterpretation only possible with ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_072.png\'%}\" alt=\"072\">\r\n\r\n<p>The western section of the board contains a bathroom area, with urinals and toilets scattered about. The player can also eat a tic tac \r\nfound on the floor of a bathroom for one health. And of course, there\'s a zombie sitting on one of the toilets. If you examine the zombie\'s \r\ntoilet, it\'s revealed to be clogged. Yuck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The north eastern corner of the room offers an empty coke bottle, a match which gives one torch, and a gold watch which is appraised at \r\none gem.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_198.png\'%}\" alt=\"198\">\r\n\r\n<p>The northeastern board has quite a bit going on. The white on dark red right facing arrow object is in fact, a Coke vending machine, and \r\none of the most amazing uses of ZZT\'s graphics I\'ve ever seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_081.png\'%}\" alt=\"081\">\r\n\r\n<p>Either that gold watch was garbage, or soda has gotten very expensive in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_082.png\'%}\" alt=\"082\">\r\n\r\n<p>Alan Wake eat your heart out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up slightly ahead is a bottle of booze with the choice to drink it. Doing so has a 75% chance of removing 5 health, and a 25% chance of \r\ngiving the player 10 health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT has no way to generate random numbers, so the way this object actually works is by checking if it\'s blocked in a random direction \r\n(something ZZT-OOP can do), and if so, you get the bad outcome, otherwise the good.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_088.png\'%}\" alt=\"088\">\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually the player makes it to the rat lord, defeats some more of their rats, as well as green mutant rats, and gets rewarded with \r\nthe maintenance key to the level.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_091.png\'%}\" alt=\"091\">\r\n\r\n<p>The key allows travel south, where there\'s a lone battery which can set the player\'s torches to five before disappearing, some cash, and \r\na \"fully licensed medical practitioner\" who can set your health all the way to 100 for 10 gems.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_095.png\'%}\" alt=\"095\">\r\n\r\n<p>Heading south the player comes full circle and into the room with the urban shaman again. It\'s possible for the player to miss the gun \r\nif they take the northern path first and opt to take the elevator right away. They can backtrack, but there\'s little reason to if you \r\naren\'t aware that you did miss anything in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_201.png\'%}\" alt=\"201\">\r\n\r\n<p>The second level introduces some new enemies right away, ghouls, which are much stronger than the rats and roaches faced on the first \r\nlevel. The ghouls take three hits from your bat and are knocked backwards when struck to prevent the player from easily scoring multiple \r\nhits in a row. The player will likely want to try out their new pistol here against these stronger enemies, but like zombies, ghouls are \r\nimmune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my own playthrough I opted to head south, so that large western area will be covered later. The rest of the screen contains \r\nlittle of note, a marble statue, and some cash in another bathroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_204.png\'%}\" alt=\"204\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_102.png\'%}\" alt=\"102\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen contains quite a lot of zombies, but unlike the ones found on the first floor, these ones are active from the start and \r\nhave a chance to actually hurt the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_103.png\'%}\" alt=\"103\">\r\n\r\n<p>A trap consisting of guns which shoot when the player lines up with them is up ahead. The player gets just barely enough time to realize \r\nwhat\'s going on and get out of the way. I thought it was a nice trap but probably because I didn\'t get caught by it. The guns shoot as fast \r\nas they possibly can, so if the player doesn\'t get out the way, they\'ll lose a lot of health really quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the lower right corner there\'s more cash and another surprise gun, but since the player doesn\'t need to line themselves up with the \r\ngun to get the money, it\'s pretty ineffective.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_203.png\'%}\" alt=\"203\">\r\n\r\n<p>The southwest room on this level contains its boss and exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_109.png\'%}\" alt=\"109\">\r\n\r\n<p>The boss this time, is a necromancer with several zombies defending them. The zombies go down easily enough, and a single hit on the \r\nnecromancer is all it takes to end the fight, causing any surviving zombies to vanish. The player\'s reward for the fight is the elevator to \r\nthe next level, a replacement flashlight battery, some cash and ammo, and a TV dinner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heading to the north to explore the rest of the level is another coke machine, and some more trap guns. Unlike the earlier ones, these \r\nfire more slowly and are recessed into the walls enough that the player has plenty of time to react. Plus, the tiny gap between the two \r\noffers a safe spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_202.png\'%}\" alt=\"202\">\r\n\r\n<p>The last new board has a glass wall blocking access to the rest of the room. It can be shot to instantly destroy it, or bashed at with \r\nyour bat, where it takes a whopping four swings to destroy. This glass is the toughest thing encountered in the game so far!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/blade.gif\'%}\" alt=\"Groovy Blade\">\r\n\r\n<p>Then there\'s this neat little trap. A swinging blade spins around in circles and you have to time your movement carefully to not be \r\nstruck by it. Some ghouls will likely get caught up in the blade and it has no effect on them unfortunately, but for all the little \r\ndecorative touches of empty bottles and leather seats throughout the subway, having something like this that moves really stands out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do get hit by the blade, it\'ll cost you a good 15 health, so be careful!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_121.png\'%}\" alt=\"121\">\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of decoration, there\'s an empty wrapper littered on the ground here, and right next to it is a still intact nutri-grain bar \r\nthat heals the player for 10 health.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_123.png\'%}\" alt=\"123\">\r\n\r\n<p>Looping back around ot the starting screen, there\'s little more than some cobwebs and a breath mint which restores two whole health.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_126.png\'%}\" alt=\"126\">\r\n\r\n<p>But most importantly is this friendly ghoul next to a vending machine, surrounded with empty coke bottles.

ZZT has a weird running theme of there being toilets \r\nin so many games which you can of course flush. Here though, the toilets fight back, taking several hits to defeat, temporarily turning \r\nthemselves invisible, and spreading water around which impedes the player. You can defeat them in one shot from your gun though, so there\'s \r\nfinally a good use for all that ammo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also another doctor to reset your health. If the player is smart they can pay them first, and then heat up the TV dinner they \r\njust received at the end of the 2nd floor, putting them at 120 health. A fountain up ahead will make that 140.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_206.png\'%}\" alt=\"206\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_138.png\'%}\" alt=\"138\">\r\n\r\n<p>The second screen of this level has a few more zombies and toilet demons to fight. If you inspect the urinals you get this interesting \r\nmessage</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_137.png\'%}\" alt=\"137\">\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps it\'s a horcrux.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can\'t destroy the urinals, so the message is just for flavor. Destroying one won\'t destroy a matching \r\ntoilet demon or anything like that, which would have been a neat feature, but probably difficult to educate the player on.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_140.png\'%}\" alt=\"140\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s one last gun trap to get past. This time, they player has to actually time their movement towards the gun in order to access the \r\nlast section of the level. It\'s a nice steady progression for traps and the timing required is reasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_141.png\'%}\" alt=\"141\">\r\n\r\n<p>The last trap of this room is a gun that behaves differently from the others encountered so far. This one moves from left to right while \r\nshooting upwards. When it reaches the end, it quickly heads left resetting itself. It\'s like a typewriter of bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_205.png\'%}\" alt=\"205\">\r\n\r\n<p>Heading right, takes you back to the same board you started on! The third level is only two rooms long, and takes advantage of having to \r\nset exits both ways in ZZT allowing you to create some rather bizarre connections. Heading west or north from here takes you to the \r\nprevious screen. It\'s so confusing, I just realized I wrote those previous paragraphs backwards to how you actually traverse the board!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you actually start at the typewriter gun, and end with the urinal horcrux.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_143.png\'%}\" alt=\"143\">\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the entrance to the next level is this sign warning you that backtracking will become impossible.

The door on the left refuses to open, but the one on the right does which lets the player run past \r\nsome more guns. From there the path splits south and east, east is a dead end with more guns and serves as nothing more than a trap for the \r\nplayer. There\'s not even a safe spot at the end, if you continue down that path you\'re probably getting shot when you realize you have to \r\nturn around.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_163.png\'%}\" alt=\"163\">\r\n\r\n<p>The last room you can explore has three bottles, one empty, one healing elixir, and one empty bottle of booze.  Most importantly, it has \r\na magical staff!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_164.png\'%}\" alt=\"164\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_165.png\'%}\" alt=\"165\">\r\n\r\n<p>Touching the staff causes the nearby grate to open up, freeing the imps trapped behind it. They have to funnel out one by one so there\'s \r\nnot much danger to the player at this point. After this, the entire level has been explored so the player has to backtrack and see if \r\nanything has changed since touching the staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_168.png\'%}\" alt=\"168\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_169.png\'%}\" alt=\"169\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_170.png\'%}\" alt=\"170\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_172.png\'%}\" alt=\"172\">\r\n\r\n<p>I was expecting to have to run around the level chasing down the staff, but was instead lured right into Shigesato\'s trap. He lets you \r\nout, and the final battle begins. The fight doesn\'t really feel any different than the previous fights. He\'ll change his appearance to be \r\nless visible than a smiley face, but never go fully invisible. Like so many other enemies in this game he\'s immune to bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_179.png\'%}\" alt=\"179\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_180.png\'%}\" alt=\"180\">\r\n\r\n<p>But eventually he\'s defeated without any fanfare, and progress can resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_184.png\'%}\" alt=\"184\">\r\n\r\n<p>There are a whole lot of random decorations in the final room of the game. Pots, a shrub, a cracked mirror, gems, gold figurines all \r\ndecorate this last section.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_186.png\'%}\" alt=\"186\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_190.png\'%}\" alt=\"190\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_192.png\'%}\" alt=\"192\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_194.png\'%}\" alt=\"194\">\r\n\r\n<p>And with that, the game comes to a close. At first I misread the smiley\'s dialog and thought it was actually supposed to be Rudy \r\nGiuliani which would have been an amazing way to end the game. Instead you just collect your key and the game ends on the spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, Deep December is a fun little diversion. The subway setting is unique for a dungeon crawler, and the game does a decent job of \r\npopulating its dungeon with things you\'d find in a subway system. Though, now that I think about it, you never see any tracks or subway \r\ncars anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is pretty nonexistent, you go to the subway, you fight the urban warlock, you get rewarded. However, the combat itself feels \r\nfun. There are a lot of ZZT games which do melee combat by touching enemies, usually by having them alternate between two characters as a \r\nway to indicate when they\'re attacking or they\'re vulnerable, which makes the pace of combat slow as you have to approach carefully. Deep \r\nDecember takes a more reckless approach, you can attack at any time and your attacks will get priority over the enemy\'s own, instead \r\nrelying on sheer numbers to surround the player to make them take damage. The knockback on hitting a stronger enemy also aids in preventing \r\nthe player from simply holding down an arrow key until they win. That isn\'t to say the combat is perfect though. The gun can be missed, \r\nwhich would probably be more of a flaw if half the enemies weren\'t immune to bullets to begin with. Deep December could have committed to \r\nbeing melee only and wouldn\'t have suffered for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s also a dark game, and unlike most ZZT games which utilize darkness, it handles it very well. The recharging stations are prevalent \r\nenough that torches won\'t be an issue and also prevent really being stuck in the dark. The levels seem designed with the small torch light \r\nin mind, narrow corridors and small rooms. The lack of moving enemies that shoot (other than minibosses which don\'t attack until you\'re \r\nalready close) means that you don\'t have to worry about something from across the room shooting you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil barrels are a poor mechanic and only hinder the player. As shown earlier, it\'s possible to softlock the game without cheats if \r\nyou don\'t have enough ammo to make your way through spilled oil. They\'re my biggest gripe, but for the most part you can easily avoid \r\nhitting them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deep December is a short game. I completed it in less than half an hour, but it didn\'t feel as short when I was actually playing it. The \r\nlevels do get shorter and shorter giving the game a bit of a rushed feel in hindsight. Going by the late August release date, perhaps \r\nAnthony Testa was trying to get the game complete before Summer vacation ended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT has had plenty of dungeon crawlers, Dungeon Guru Nostalgia, Respite, Deceiving Guidance, Scramble Dash Dungeons, and a good three or \r\nfour more by Testa himself. The modern setting is absent from all the rest, making this title stand out thematically among a reasonably \r\npopular genre for ZZT games. The care it shows in ensuring the player can make it through, without babying them with an overabundance of \r\nitems makes the game something worth checking out regardless of its short length and lack of story when compared to its other dungeon \r\ncrawl brethren.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where can I get Deep December?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Deep December is available on  \r\n<a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=deepdec.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a> \r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_deepdec\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-09-11',1,'django',2,173,'',''),(175,'Closer Look: 640x350x16 A History of ZZT\'s Graphics','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<p>ZZT was released in 1991, and from the very beginning it was woefully outdated in terms of graphics. Contemporary PC games of 1991 \r\nincluded several 16 color games like id Software\'s \r\n<a href=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/Commander_Keen_Secret_of_the_Oracle_gameplay.jpg\' %}\" target=\"_blank\">Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy</a>\r\n and <a href=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/Crystal_Caves_title_screen.png\' %}\" target=\"_blank\">Apogee\'s Crystal Caves</a>. These games had a very \r\nrestrictive palette to work with, but unlike ZZT, were running in proper graphics modes and not text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in the console world the Sega Genesis had been around and the US launch of the Super Nintendo meant that those playing games \r\non mainstream consoles were getting the far more colorful graphics of \r\n<a href=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/MD_Sonic_the_Hedgehog.png\' %}\" target=\"_blank\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> \r\nand <a href=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/DonutPlains.png\' %}\" target=\"_blank\">Super Mario World</a>. ZZT could never even hope \r\nto come close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet despite its very restrictive colors and graphics, there was still quite a wide range of graphical capabilities from one ZZTer\'s \r\nwork to the next. I\'d like to go on a brief overview of the exact restrictions one has to deal with when working with ZZT as the medium, \r\nand show off some examples that really push the level of quality one would expect it to be able to produce</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_000.png\' %}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n\r\n<p>First let\'s look at the technical specifications. As a text mode game ZZT runs at a 640x350 resolution, much higher than that of \r\ngraphical games at the time, but of course significantly more limited by not having complete pixel control. The game runs in a standard \r\n80x25 text mode, but even then ZZT\'s sidebar is visible at all times, restricting the author to a 480x350 space comprised of 60x25 \r\ncharacters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that\'s rough, but it gets worse. Despite having the ability to display 16 colors, ZZT\'s editor only allows the use of seven colors. \r\nNamely the high intensity ones which you can see in the color selector in the lower right section of the editor screenshot above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further compounding things, not all elements in ZZT can have their colors changed in the editor. You can make things like walls and \r\nobjects any of those seven colors without issue, but a lion is always red, and a tiger is always cyan.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_001.png\' %}\" alt=\"001\">\r\n\r\n<p>But we\'re not through yet. See this maze? It\'s made out of objects without any programming, so effectively a bunch of walls with custom \r\ncharacters. Here\'s the catch. This maze is made up of 150 objects, and objects have \"stats\", and thus to conserve memory ZZT has a limit of \r\n151 stat elements permitted per board. The player is #151 here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This board can\'t have any enemies added. It can\'t have a passage to take you to another room since that requires a stat. If the player \r\ntried to shoot, no bullet would spawn. A common criticism of modern AAA game development is that the focus is on graphics as opposed to how \r\nthe game itself plays. In ZZT the tradeoff between graphics and gameplay can be very literal.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_009.png\' %}\" alt=\"009\">\r\n\r\n<p>So let\'s take a look at which tiles can do what with the restrictions covered so far</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the left half are the elements which are the most restrictive graphically. Ammo, torches, energizers, water*, forest, and ricochets \r\nhave their colors set in stone, but you can fill an entire screen with them if you wanted. The most restrictive elements are the player, \r\nruffians, tigers, duplicators, sharks, bullets, bears, lions, stars, and scrolls, which count towards the 151 stat element limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right half is where your inner artist gets to play. The main types of walls, solid, normal, breakable, line, fake, and invisible can \r\nbe used however you like. Along with boulders and sliders, gems, keys, and doors. Then there are the elements which have stats, but free \r\ncolor selection. These include pushers, spinning guns, transporters, passages, objects, slimes, conveyors, centipedes, and blink walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(*Despite only appearing in one color in the editor, ZZT-OOP can create water of different colors with commands like #put n cyan water. \r\nAlso of note is that DEMO.ZZT which contains a brief introduction to all of ZZT\'s elements has water that\'s gray on dark blue, which isn\'t \r\nused in any of the original ZZT worlds. Most likely the switch was made as sharks in the water are much more obvious with the blue \r\ncolor.)</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/adventure.png\' %}\" alt=\"Adventure\">\r\n\r\n<p>So early on, you\'ll find most ZZT worlds that aren\'t creating abstract geometry like Town, tend to come off looking very bright. This \r\nscreenshot is of the main town in Adventure Part 1. The purple walls around the town are actually objects. Which means this screen uses 118 \r\nout of 151 stat elements. Even a board like this is cutting it close with ZZT\'s limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/town-forest.png\' %}\" alt=\"Town\'s Forest\">\r\n\r\n<p>But even from day one ZZT\'s rules were being broken in the name of art. Consider this board from Town of ZZT, the first ZZT game. ZZT\'s \r\ndefault graphics probably handle a forest environment best of all with bright green walls and dark green, well, forests. The spade and club \r\ncharacters for objects are easy interpretations of a tree. Yet already, elements here are being used for something other than their \r\nintended purpose. The outer area of the board that the player is restricted from ever entering is filled with torches to give the forest \r\nsome much needed brown coloring. It helps as well that the Yen symbol also makes a half decent tree trunk character as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/adventure2.png\' %}\" alt=\"Adventure 2 Title\">\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the use of torches for trees can be seen literally on the title screen for Adventure Part 2. A clever trick, but it\'s easy to \r\ntake things one step further.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/lost_monkeys.png\' %}\" alt=\"Lost Monkeys\">\r\n\r\n<p>Brown! Honest to goodness brown trees! The Lost Monkeys by Chris Jong, released in 1993 already shows considerable improvements in just \r\ntwo years. Fake walls are used as grass, and that allows ZZT\'s regular empty tiles to be treated as shadows. There\'s a sense of depth and \r\nsome rudimentary shading with brown and dark green walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the secret?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_002.png\' %}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n\r\n<p>Simply using ZZT\'s built in text functionality! To the player, there\'s no difference between text and a wall. Using this trick you can \r\nproduce effectively solid walls in dark blue, green, cyan, red, purple, and yellow. White text uses a black background, so unless you want \r\nan invisible wall that doesn\'t reveal itself, you won\'t get much use out of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the darker colors offer the benefit of nice water, trees, ice, and really just add some more variety to the look of ZZT games \r\nin general. There is a downside to using this though. ZZT has zero ways to reference text in ZZT-OOP. You can #change yellow solid blue gem \r\njust fine, but text is text and always will be text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next innovation in ZZT graphics would come from discoveries again involving torches, and some other built in elements as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/stk_via_oop.gif\' %}\" alt=\"All with OOP!\">\r\n\r\n<p>By using the #change command, and not specifying a color for the element to transform into, the current color is used. In the case of \r\nthese elements, it means access to gray, dark yellow, dark purple, dark cyan, and black on dark green. This trick only really works via \r\nZZT-OOP, so there\'s no real way to design a board with them in the editor normally. However, what can be done is playing the game, having \r\nthe changes execute, and saving. If you then rename the file from .SAV to .ZZT, ZZT will realize you\'re trying to edit a saved game and \r\nreject it. Unless, you open the editor first, and use the ?+DEBUG cheat code. Then you can edit it like a regular ZZT world. From there, \r\njust export the board, load up the game that needs those colors, and import the board!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we\'re really getting somewhere. We\'ve gone from 7 colors to 12. Of course, with foreground and background colors being independent, \r\nthat\'s still a mere 12 out of 256 combinations, but the next discovery is arguably the most important discovery in ZZT...</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_003.png\' %}\" alt=\"003\">\r\n\r\n<p>Alexis Janson\'s Super Tool Kit was the game changer in 1994. Alexis had been messing around with ZZT files, taking a look at its file \r\nformat, where she noted that elements on a board were stored with three bytes, the quantity, the color, and the element. So ZZT\'s own board \r\nformat explicitly stated, \"One green on black object\", \"Four red on black solid walls\", \"Six dark yellow on black torches\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so she changed those color values and saw what happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_004.png\' %}\" alt=\"004\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_005.png\' %}\" alt=\"005\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_006.png\' %}\" alt=\"006\">\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, we had colors. We had every combination of them. Super Tool Kit had such an effect on ZZT\'s graphics, that using colors \r\nnot possible in ZZT\'s editor became known as using \"STK colors\". Games released prior to Super Tool Kit would be referred to as Pre-STK. \r\nFor ZZT, Super Tool Kit was an epoch, dividing its history into two halves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1991 a typical ZZT world looked like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/thestolengems.png\' %}\" alt=\"The Stolen Gems\">\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of 1994 you\'d get something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/codered.png\' %}\" alt=\"Code Red\">\r\n\r\n<p>It was a huge leap! The only limit graphically was now the number of stat elements. No more issues with color when making your game. If \r\nyou wanted a dark green ruffian it was yours. If you wanted to have the player walk on black on dark green fake walls as some light grass \r\nyou could. If you wanted buildings in a city to be gray and not white, it was an option.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/adventure.png\' %}\" alt=\"Adventure\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/qfg.png\' %}\" alt=\"Quest For Glory\">\r\n\r\n<p>Here\'s that screenshot of a village in Adventure again compared to a screenshot of a village in 1998\'s Quest For Glory.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/people.png\' %}\" alt=\"People!\">\r\n\r\n<p>You could draw honest to god _people_ now.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_007.png\' %}\" alt=\"007\">\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, giving somebody more colors won\'t make them a talented artist, but for those better versed in creating artwork in ZZT, there \r\nwas suddenly a huge change in what could be done. There was a cost though.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/zzt_008.png\' %}\" alt=\"008\">\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT\'s editor wasn\'t built around these colors, so to get them in your own game you\'d have to import boards from STK. ZZT does have a \r\nlimit of 101 boards in a file, but few games would ever come close to this. The real cost was in time. Pressing enter on a tile in ZZT \r\ncopies it to a single empty space on the pattern buffer. ZZTers would be working on their board, switch to an STK board, grab a specially \r\ncolored element, switch back to the first board, and place the tile. For a complex board with a lot of uniquely colored elements, this \r\ngreatly increased the amount of time it took to make a board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was also clutter in a game\'s board structure. A developer would import a few STK boards they\'d need as soon as they started \r\na new world, but then 10 boards in realize they also needed a dark green line wall and have to import another STK board and have it as \r\nboard number eleven. There was no easy way to rearrange boards, so things could get disjointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most popular way to combat this, was with the creation of a personal toolkit. Instead of STK\'s sparse boards with every variation of \r\na single element on a board, toolkits (sometimes called color kits) would instead attempt to cram as much STK content on a single board \r\nbased on what the author deemed most important to have quick access to.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/colorbrd.png\' %}\" alt=\"COLOR.BRD\">\r\n\r\n<p>Pictured above is Spectrum12\'s Color Toolbox, to my knowledge this is the first toolkit. Compared to later toolkits it is extremely \r\nsparse!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/snack.png\' %}\" alt=\"SNACK3\">\r\n\r\n<p>I personally was always fond of Super Neato All Color Kit (SNACK). Plenty of useful things are available along with several pre-made \r\nblends which were great for people like me who could not make a decent looking texture themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/deep-december/cru.png\' %}\" alt=\"Colors R\' Us\">\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, last one. This one was mine! It even has an ASCII chart shown in text and that scroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world of color kits is ZZT at its most colorful. These boards are often such chaotic messes, and some people would go so far as to \r\nmake toolkits that were two or three boards in size, which I always found overkill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The age of the toolkit continued for quite a bit, as there weren\'t really any improvements to actually make, at least not within ZZT \r\nitself...</p>','','2016-09-18',1,'django',1,NULL,'articles/cl/640x350x16/preview.png','Exploring graphical evolutions and revolutions in ZZT\'s text mode worlds.'),(176,'Closer Look: 640x350x16 A History of ZZT\'s Graphics','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<p>Ok, I\'m exaggerating a bit when I say there aren\'t any improvements left. While Super Tool Kit provides vast numbers of specially \r\ncolored elements, it doesn\'t cover everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zzt_006.png\' %}\" alt=\"006\">\r\n\r\n<p>You can see here a huge lack of special colors for these items. Others would go on to fill out the rest. Starting with Chronos\'s More \r\nSTK. This filled out the rest of the essentials, with ammo, torches, keys, doors, and all 256 possible characters of text as ZZT\'s text \r\ninput didn\'t support using alt-codes. Chronos went on to release Weird STK as well, which plays around with what happens when you remove \r\nthe stats from elements that normally have them. This gives you things like enemies which can\'t move and player clones that come in any \r\ncolor and can be used to make a crowd without having to use an object. Lastly was WiL\'s WiL STK, which introduces the previously unknown \r\nmonitor element that replaces the player on the title screen and reacts to keys like world selection and viewing high scores. It also has \r\nbombs that take more or less time to explode, and well, weird stuff that doesn\'t have much of a point, like statless slimes that cause ZZT \r\nto crash when touched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with all these STKs, ZZT has hit its natural peak for graphics capabilities. To do anything else, ZZTers would have to look at \r\nmodifying things that ZZT has no control over.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/fm_000.png\' %}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/fm_001.png\' %}\" alt=\"001\">\r\n\r\n<p>Font Mania is an MS-DOS utility which allows creating temporary replacements for the system font. The program was released \r\nin 1992, though it would be some time before the ZZT community discovered it and began to create custom fonts. Now your tough action hero \r\ndidn\'t have to have a big smile on their face at all times. The screenshots from Font Mania are using the font created for Raichu\'s game \r\nEscape From Zyla Island. You can see various weapons, a flashlight instead of a torch, and some angrier looking smiley faces, including \r\nones facing different directions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Font Mania could be used to create an executable that could set and clear a custom font. By making a batch file to load the font, launch \r\nZZT, and remove the font when done it was possible to easily use these fonts in ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One malicious individual in the past submitted a game that used a font, but the batch file was a \"virus\" (their words) which deleted all \r\nthe files in C:\\ZZT! What a jerk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately though, fonts saw limited use in the ZZT community. z2 lists about 40 files with fonts, and several of those are just \"you \r\ncan use this font in your game!\" type releases, and not worlds that actually use them such as Hyper ZZT, shown here:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zzt_015.png\' %}\" alt=\"015\">\r\n\r\n<p>I\'d wager the biggest reason for fonts not taking off in ZZT was simply that they didn\'t add all that much over the default tileset. An \r\nomega might not be the best representation of a lion possible, but frankly, with an 8x14 working resolution, you\'ll never really be able to \r\nget all that much better. Plus, you\'re still stuck with only one possible character for builtins. If you use the Hyper ZZT font, every \r\npassage is going to look like a cave entrance. That\'s fine for a cave, but falls apart when you\'re making an entrance to a building or a \r\nstaircase to the next floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you\'re not using a custom font, then your passage is going to be a logical equivalence character for a cave, door, or staircase. The \r\npassage character becomes abstract enough that it doesn\'t take too much of a leap to see it as a door or stairs, and though it might be \r\nmore lacking as a cave, the limitations of ZZT are expected. Creating a font often means \"fixing\" the appearance of some tiles, but that\r\ncomes at the expense of removing their versatility as abstract forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only two worlds with fonts are particularly noteworthy. WiL\'s 2000 release Banana Quest, and the 2004 art compilation Ownage Triangle by \r\naetsch and Kracken (lovingly compiled by Zenith Nadir). Here\'s the font used in Banana Quest:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/bq-font.png\' %}\" alt=\"BQ\'s Font\">\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, it touches very little. There are bananas of course, and a few other oddities like a horn and what I believe is supposed \r\nto be a flank of meat. Other than that are a few triangle shapes scattered throughout the font. However the replaced characters are chosen \r\nvery purposely. The diamond, asterisk, house, and lowercase A with an umlaut are used in ZZT for gems, richochets, energizers, and ammo. So \r\nwhy replace built in elements like this? For the art. All of those elements can be produced in any color and any quantity. By replacing \r\nthese elements, it\'s possible to use these tiles without running into the stat limit on a board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Ownage Triangle\'s font is even sparser. It only changes the characters used by sliders to match some of the half-block \r\ncharacters for the same reason as Banana Quest. In this case the font exists solely to bend the rules of a stat limit, and looks \r\nfunctionally identical to a standard ZZT world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out this super cool drawing of Sega\'s Espio the Chameleon character shown without and with the font in use:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/espio.png\' %}\" alt=\"espio fontless\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zzt_017.png\' %}\" alt=\"espio fonted\">\r\n\r\n<p>With STK and fonts, ZZT had hit its peak graphically. Yet there was still more to do. By this point in time, ZZT wasn\'t the friendliest \r\nprogram to make ZZT worlds with. Constantly switching boards to get STK colors, objects whose code would sometimes randomly delete \r\nitself. Boards that used too much memory would sometimes get corrupted when saving. It was frankly a bit of a mess for what people in the \r\nlate 90s and early 2000s were trying to do with ZZT. Fortunately, a modernization was about to occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/kev1.png\' %}\" alt=\"KevEdit color select\">\r\n\r\n<p>In 2000 Kevin Vance released KevEdit, the first external editor for ZZT. The most important feature, was innate support for STK colors. \r\nNo more toolkits, no more running back and forth between boards. But KevEdit offered a lot more over ZZT\'s own editor than just a nice \r\ncolor selector.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/kev2.png\' %}\" alt=\"KevEdit object editing\">\r\n\r\n<p>Its object editor also offered lots of convenience. Syntax highlighting, word wrap, the ability to copy and paste text (and also chunks \r\nof boards in the editor\'s main interface), exporting and importing code to text files, all of these helped greatly speed up the process of \r\ncreating a ZZT world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And while a nice perk at the time, KevEdit being built for Windows and Linux systems let it keep going long after new PCs stopped being \r\ncapable of running ZZT without Dosbox. Going into ZZT\'s default editor and actually trying to make things with it today feels very sluggish \r\nand clunky. If you\'re making a ZZT game today, you\'re almost certainly going to want to make it with KevEdit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around the time of its release, the use of external editors was actually banned for a few 24 Hours of ZZT contests in order to prevent \r\npeople from having an advantage over those who weren\'t using it! This wasn\'t something that could really be enforced and the rule quickly \r\ngave way. Most ZZTers adopted an external editor eventually, with Zenith Nadir\'s sticking to color kits being a noteworthy exception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although KevEdit was the first external editor, it wasn\'t the only one of its kind. 2001 saw the release of CyQ\'s ZZT AdvancEditor, \r\nwhich offered many of the features of KevEdit, with a few of its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zztae_000.png\' %}\" alt=\"ZZTAE\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zztae_001.png\' %}\" alt=\"ZZTAE\">\r\n\r\n<p>It of course had the same extend color selection that would become mandatory, as well as its own syntax highlighting and other features \r\nfrom KevEdit, but what made ZZTAE stand out was its built in fade tool for quickly creating graphics</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zztae_002.png\' %}\" alt=\"ZZTAE Fades\">\r\n\r\n<p>You could select a rectangular region of the board, and then select from 19 different patterns to apply over that region, with the \r\nability to introduce random noise into them as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zztae_003.png\' %}\" alt=\"ZZTAE\">\r\n\r\n<p>Not bad for just a few key presses. In KevEdit this sort of thing would still have to be done by hand, giving it a bit of an edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although even with this very nice feature, KevEdit was generally considered the superior choice. ZZTAE was written in QBASIC and still \r\nconstrained to MS-DOS, which today kills it, and back then meant sporadic crashes due to its own memory issues. To be \r\nfair to him, I was a ZZTAE user until I was no longer able to run MS-DOS programs natively and made the jump to KevEdit on Windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZTAE was also interesting in that it used some unused space in ZZT\'s file format to flag that the world had been edited with ZZTAE, \r\nwhich meant people using it in contests where it was forbidden could get caught cheating! It didn\'t take long before somebody made a \r\nprogram to erase that watermark, and again, external editors were shortly permitted in contests regardless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surprisingly, in 2008 when ZZT was essentially on its deathbed as far as games being made, a surprise third external editor came out, \r\nSaxxon Pike\'s ZAP</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zap1.png\' %}\" alt=\"ZAP\">\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the previous two editors, ZAP wasn\'t as fleshed out, but that was because it was designed more to supplement other editors, \r\nand instead take advantage of its support for the mouse as a method of drawing boards. It was well received, but I don\'t know if anybody \r\never used it for a released world. Still, it stands out as something pretty unique compared to KevEdit and ZZTAE\'s approach of just \r\nreplicating the default editor with a few more features to make things more user friendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One other claim to fame ZAP has, is that it doesn\'t just support ZZT worlds. The oft forgetton Super ZZT is also supported.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zap2.png\' %}\" alt=\"ZAP Super ZZT\">\r\n\r\n<p>Super ZZT was Tim Sweeney\'s direct sequel to ZZT and needs an article on its own, but let\'s just say it never took off for a variety of \r\nreasons. Its editor is notoriously buggy, so if you were going to make a Super ZZT world, ZAP would definitely be the way to go!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so that\'s about all there is to say about graphics in ZZT. It was an engine that was pushed beyond its limits repeatedly to squeeze \r\nout just a little bit more from an outdated medium of art. Super Tool Kit has often been credited as having added years to ZZT\'s lifespan, \r\nand while it\'s hard to say how true that is, there are certainly a lot of games where the default 7 color limit would have greatly impacted the \r\ngame\'s atmosphere and ability to convey its story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT\'s rules are so bizarre and restrictive, but despite this people with or without STK created some rather stellar looking scenes. Its \r\nlimits gave creativity to those who dared to push the boundaries, while also safely anchoring those who couldn\'t produce satisfactory pixel \r\nart in an environment where that didn\'t matter. In an industry where games graphics are still a selling point, there\'s something to be said \r\nabout this program which taught people to throw that thinking away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addendum -- 2016-09-21</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait a minute, wait a minute. I wrote all this and somehow missed one other bizarre tool created to get some interesting graphics into \r\nZZT, Combuster\'s Z-Bitmap. Z-Bitmap is exactly what it sounds like it is, a tool which takes a user supplied bitmap file, and converts it \r\ninto a ZZT board file.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zbmp.png\' %}\" alt=\"Z-Bitmap Interface\"><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Scenery#/media/File:Adarshlovely.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Original Image</a>\r\n\r\n<p>It creates a very distinct look, unlike anything created by hand in ZZT really. The provided files don\'t really explain the process for \r\nconverting images, but you can watch the conversion happen and it appears to simply average out each 8x14 section onto a tile. Due to ZZT\'s \r\nlimitations with objects, it sticks solely to using solid, normal, breakable, and water elements to create the boards. For obvious reasons, \r\nit\'s difficult to get a solid looking conversion, but the output is generally understandable enough, if very blurry and lacking in \r\ndetail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to just rendering the BMP, there is built in support for where to position the image on the output board, as well as scaling \r\nthe image. It\'s tough to figure out what sort of images work best in ZBMP, generally things that are already low resolution and limited in \r\ncolors to begin with. Ideally with a flat background, as the more detailed an area is, the more the background will be mixed with the \r\nforeground when converting.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/640x350x16/zzt_023.png\' %}\" alt=\"Obama\"><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama#/media/File:President_Barack_Obama.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Original Image</a>\r\n\r\n<p>President Obama looking less than clear.

An adventure game with tricky puzzles taking place in an environment I\'d best describe as \r\nmagical-surrealism. Like Deep December, it\'s a game with a lot of atmosphere, in this case taking place in a large tower on a tiny island \r\nin another dimension. The game was well received in its day, and went on to win a Game of the Month Award. It was also tucan\'s last ZZT \r\nrelease, though nothing indicates that it was necessarily intended to be such.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game\'s text file describes Pop as a homage to ZZT\'s older days (it was only 7 at the time!), being inventory based and Kudzu-esque, \r\nand \"a really sucky way to kill a few hours\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Kudzu was another ZZT adventure where you mostly interacted with strange and usual people and things to solve puzzles)</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_001.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game\'s title screen opens with a flashing message on the bottom of the screen explaining that Pop is a game where you need no \r\nbullets or brain, and credits the game with a second author known as kabra-corn. I\'ve never heard the name kabra-corn anywhere other than \r\nthis game, and whoever this other person was, there\'s no clear remnants of them in ZZT\'s history today.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_001.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n\r\n<p>Upon starting the game, the player is taken to a menu of sorts. Lots of games opted to start on a menu rather than jump right into the \r\ngame itself to allow for things like skippable introduction boards, credits, or game instructions that the player may or may not be \r\ninterested in.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_002.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n\r\n<p>Tucan was nice enough to give some information about himself at the time of making the game. Thank goodness we no longer have to deal \r\nwith preps with pagers in the 21st century. There\'s nothing too revealing here, just a typical teenager with ZZT as a unique outlet for \r\ncreativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_003.png\'%}\" alt=\"003\">\r\n\r\n<p>As is often the case, credits in ZZT games are just the author listed for everything except for the special thanks section. The \r\nmysterious kabra-corn goes uncredited on this screen. Several of the credited names list the other games which directly inspired Pop\'s \r\ncreation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a shoutout for #darkdigital, which was the main ZZTer IRC channel at the time, which was hosted on AustNet despite the vast \r\nmajority of ZZTers being from North America and Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also love the promise of writing down the music that was listened to during the creation of the game. Listing what CDs were listened \r\nto, and what food was eaten became a common thing to include in the credits for 24 Hours of ZZT contest entries. This is the first I\'ve \r\nseen it done in a regular game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s an inaccessible board in the game\'s file which does list this music. It includes Beck, Jimi Hendrix, and The Velvet Underground \r\namong a few others.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_004.png\'%}\" alt=\"004\">\r\n\r\n<p>The last menu section to explore is the information on the game itself, what its goals were, how its name came to be, and lastly an \r\nexplanation of the game\'s inventory system</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And about that inventory. ZZT doesn\'t have any innate inventory system beyond keeping track of ammo, torches, gems, and keys. However, \r\nby turning ZZT\'s cheats into a gameplay feature it was possibly to loosely recreate the sort of thing you\'d expect from a classic LucasArts \r\nor Sierra adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typing a ? during gameplay in ZZT opens up a cheat menu, and +&gt;flag&lt; could be used to set a flag. On every single room in the game \r\nan object checks in a loop if the flag \"i\" is set, and if so, it opens a list of items you have, allowing you to select one to use on \r\nwhatever you\'re standing next to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ?+i system was used in several ZZT games (and a few action games would have you reload a gun with ?+r), but was relatively uncommon. \r\nActually typing the command got tedious quickly, and if you made a mistake and typed ?+o instead, you\'d set another flag and have to clear \r\nit with ?-o.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT only supports 10 flags, so games which used this system had to make sure you never got more than 9 items at a time (as the 10th was \r\nneeded for the \"i\" flag itself), and would have their flow designed around which items you might still have. If an 11th flag was set, it \r\nwould overwrite the 10th flag, leaving you stuck with a now missing item.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\'s take a look at how the code is structured for such a game with this new ZZT scroll technology</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll%}@inventory\r\n#cycle 1\r\n:loop\r\n#if i inventory\r\n/i\r\n#loop\r\n:end\r\n#end\r\n:inventory\r\n#clear i\r\n\r\n$- inventory -\r\n\r\n#if r !r; a rock.\r\n#if s !s; a stick.\r\n\r\n/i\r\n#loop\r\n:r\r\n#all:rock\r\n/i/i/i\r\n#stupid\r\n:s\r\n#all:stick\r\n/i/i/i\r\n#stupid\r\n\r\n:stupid\r\nthat\'s probably not it.\r\n/i\r\n#loop\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>You can see that the inventory code checks for more flags and if they\'re found brings up an interactive hyperlink the player can select \r\nwhich jumps to the :r or :s labels to use them. From there, #all:rock will tell every object on the board that if they have a :rock label \r\nin their code to jump to it. For objects that don\'t, nothing happens and they continue executing the code they\'ve been running already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If an object has a :rock label, it then tells the inventory object to jump to the :loop label and then does whatever it does when you \r\ntry to use a rock on it. If nothing tells the inventory to jump back to :loop, it will go through it\'s /i statements which tell it to idle \r\nfor a cycle, and eventually hit #stupid, jumping itself to the :stupid label and letting the player know that whatever they tried didn\'t do \r\nanything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s a cool little engine that shows what sort of mindset you need to have to write ZZT-OOP. You\'re constantly sending label jumps to \r\nother objects back and forth and reacting to that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, in most cases the thing you\'re interacting with is right next to the player to begin with and you could just have the player \r\ntouch it and bring up a list of items to use on it there, but that\'s not nearly as flashy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the game\'s mechanics explained, it\'s time to actually play some Pop!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_005.png\'%}\" alt=\"005\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_006.png\'%}\" alt=\"006\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player is dropped in atop the lavender tower with an empty inventory next to an art piece consisting of four globes, three of which \r\nhave notches in them. One of those notches has been filled with clay. This piece is known as the ya\'yono vekka, as displayed in the corner \r\nof the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Pop, every board has a title which is displayed to the player in a corner somewhere. It\'s a nice way to help the player navigate the \r\ntower, giving a concrete way to reference any room no matter how abstract its design may be.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_009.png\'%}\" alt=\"009\">\r\n\r\n<p>With only one way to proceed, the player heads to the outside of a library. There are some plants in the corner which do nothing, but \r\nare internally named as plants. I assumed it was some sort of debris in this case. The sign also states the entrance leads to a library \r\nand the player comments on being surprised to find it written in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_010.png\'%}\" alt=\"010\">\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the library is the game\'s first lore dump. Pop has quite a lot to read from books as a method of world building, and suffers from \r\na case of telling rather than showing, but reading through everything you find does help you make sense of future puzzles and gives a lot \r\nmore insight into the dimension the player\'s been trapped in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking with the person that\'s busy reading offers no help, as they\'re too invested in their book to bother speaking with the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several books line the shelf, and you can read every last one of them. Don\'t feel obligated to read them top to bottom here. Though \r\nimportant in actual gameplay, they can definitely be skimmed here.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_012.png\'%}\" alt=\"012\">\r\n\r\n<p>The mythology book is a bit meaningless. I\'m not sure if a nimby is a Not In My Back Yard. \"Yapok\" is a name drop of the ZZT game Yapok \r\nSundria.</p>\r\n\r\n{%scroll %}@·─ the tower ─·\r\n#end\r\n:touch\r\nthe tower - by keykeeper

sea, one sky\r\none island, one very large tower, and\r\na large amount of fuck-ups. as king\r\notto xxvii (most revered) once said, \r\n\"the lavender tower\'s base is basically\r\nthe well-known principle that every\r\ngreat plan, at one point, must either\r\nfuck, or be fucked.\"\r\n\r\nbasically, the tower is some sort of\r\ndivine joke created by the big guy\r\nupstairs. it is utilized by some of\r\nthe higher beings, whether these\r\nbeings are demons or angels, it is yet\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nit is a well known fact that the lavender\r\ntower serves as a sort of trap, if you \r\nwill, for people from other dimensions.\r\nhowever, the trap is a very selective one,\r\nand will only capture people of its own\r\npreference, that is to say, young men\r\nand women of a very curious persuasion.\r\n  why these particular men and women\r\nare selected remains unexplained, but it\r\nis said that the demons/angels are testing\r\nthe proportions of human curiousity and\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nanother strange fact about the lavender\r\ntower is that at no point does it open\r\nout onto the ground level. in fact, a\r\nfloor or staircase situated on ground\r\nlevel is yet to be found by the several\r\n\"wanderers\" who \"wander\" about the lav-\r\nender tower in search of an exit. not\r\neven the keykeeper of the lavender tower\r\nhas found an exit. which leads us to\r\nanother subject...\r\n\r\n the keykeeper of the tower is a god-like\r\nfigure that watches over the \"wanderers\",\r\nand tends the grounds of the lavender\r\ntower.\r\nthe keykeeper of the tower is a former\r\n\"wanderer\" selected by a small ring of\r\nunseen \"watchers\", the demons/angels\r\nwho constantly glare at the tower\r\ndenizens from above. i have had the luck\r\nto be selected for this sole privelege,\r\nit came to me as a dream. the \r\n\"watchers\" informed me that i had attained\r\na very remarkable amount of curiousity,\r\na feat that would not go unrewarded. i\r\nwoke from this dream, breaking out in a\r\nsweat, with a key around my neck.\r\n\r\nof this affair, i can tell you no more,\r\nother than that it is true... the key-\r\nkeeper of the tower does attain the\r\nposition of a demi-god, if you will.\r\nthere is nothing that is not outside of\r\nmy doing.\r\n#end\r\n:b\r\nhûdû- a large possum-like creature with\r\n      fierce territorial instincts. they\r\n      can speak all or most languages,\r\n      possessing both a tenacity to \r\n      learn and a fiery intellect. \r\n      however, the hûdû is not without\r\n      its faults. it is surprisingly weak,\r\n      very belligerent, and usually un-\r\n      willing to speak to anything about\r\n      anything.\r\n\r\ngrook- a furry, mammalian/snake. these\r\n       creatures can detect the presence\r\n       of minute amounts of gold.\r\n       they served keykeepers as a metal\r\n       detector of sorts. they are now in\r\n       scarcity, a fact owing to their\r\n       magnificent golden pelts. as otto\r\n       the xxvii described: \"a sort of\r\n       drab yellow.\"\r\n\r\nrankallan- a large scaly lizard type \r\n           creature possessing suckered\r\n           feet, and over 20 feet of\r\n           colorfully decked body. \r\n           rankallans lead long peaceful\r\n           lives consisting mainly of\r\n           eating passing \"wanderers\" \r\n           and scaling the tower sideways\r\n           with suckered feet. they re-\r\n           produce asexually, so there is\r\n           usually only one rankallan in\r\n           existence at a time. the cur-  \r\n           rent rankallan answers to the\r\n           name of boris. rankallans, when\r\n           near death, all go to a local\r\n           cave to die. the remains of a\r\n           slain rankallan are perfectly\r\n           preserved near the tower\r\n           balconies.\r\n\r\nphrog- a creature resembling a colorful\r\n       bullfrog. it is well known that\r\n       they are extremely partial to\r\n       mangoes and will come out of\r\n       hiding places just for the cause\r\n       of one. their hides are tough,\r\n       and it will take more than one\r\n       slash of a knife to kill a phrog\r\n       and take its hide. their hides,\r\n       which are indeed decorative, are\r\n       also poisonous, and are tra-\r\n       ditionally used on blowpipe darts.\r\n\r\nreazles- small, rat/weasel combinations.\r\n         a reazle\'s chief predator is a\r\n         large slice of gouda or stilton.\r\n         they are known to eat coins them-\r\n         selves.\r\n\r\neguinius- large, predatory sea-horses that\r\n          dwell on land and water. it is\r\n          a well-known fact that eguinius\'\r\n          trample victims to death with \r\n          their groins, then slowly suck\r\n          their juices through straw-like\r\n          snouts.\r\n\r\neboral- leathery combinations of \r\n        loch ness monsters/hammerhead \r\n        sharks/dogs.\r\n\r\nparakeets- the one animal known to exist\r\n           in all universes at the same\r\n           time, for some annoying reason.\r\n           parakeets have the ability to\r\n           memorize long phrases like\r\n           \"help! jonathan\'s locked me in\r\n           the closet!\", and release them\r\n           when jonathan\'s having tea with\r\n           a friend.\r\n\r\notters- not like the otters found in\r\n        similar universes. small, sleek,\r\n        sentient creatures known to \r\n        breathe fire and eat things dwell-\r\n        ing in closet. the first keykeeper\r\n        moe was known to worship these.\r\n\r\ndruphus- adorable rabbit like creatures\r\n         who were trained by king otto\r\n         the xxvii to eat people who said\r\n         the phrase, \"gee, otto, i\'d \r\n         really like to borrow some cash.\"\r\n\r\noctarines- not animals, but fruits. \r\n           octarines have a nectarine-\r\n           like appearance and a blue-ish\r\n           color. they are known to taste\r\n           like an individual\'s conscience\r\n           (curious people taste a curious\r\n           octarine, mad people taste,\r\n           strangely enough, a mad \r\n           octarine.) rare delicacies.\r\n\r\nchameleon rocks- are known to change \r\n                 colors to blend into\r\n                 their

In short, curious creatures are taken from their dimension to this one where \r\nmysterious \"watchers\" are entertained by those who search the tower for an escape.

how could this\r\nuniverse be a \'game\'? and there was a \r\nsecret ending to it? come now, how can\r\none already foresee the ending? the reazle\r\ndisappeared. i hid the gem inside the ya\'\r\nyono vekka.\r\n#end\r\n:g\r\njuly 20, 1997- ilsa and i have found a new\r\nstaircase! we have no clue where it leads\r\nto, but we have decided to keep it a \r\nsecret from the rest of the group.\r\n#end\r\n:h\r\njuly 22, 1997- i have lost ilsa. we found\r\nthe exit, it appeared as a shimmering\r\ngateway that was approachable from any\r\nside. ilsa urged me to step through, but\r\ni refused, i did not know where it would\r\nlead. this universe is fine enough for me.\r\nilsa stepped through, and the gateway\r\nclosed behind her. she is the only human\r\nto ever find the exit.\r\n#end\r\n:i\r\njuly 21, 1997- i had staked myself out\r\nwhere the gateway once was, when people\r\ngarbed in strange manner came up to me.\r\nthey were watchers they said, and said\r\nthat they would like to reward me for my\r\ncourage. i had no courage, i denied, but\r\nthey said that true courage comes from\r\nsquelching one\'s inhibitions. no, i said,\r\ntrue courage comes from doing what one\r\nthinks is right. a \'watcher\' named boris\r\nlaughed and said that we need not lessons\r\nin morality. they have crowned me the new\r\nkeykeeper. don\'t let the name fool you.\r\nall i do is maintain this place. they\r\nwill tell me more about this universe \r\nlater on.\r\n#end\r\n:j\r\nlost the date.\r\n\r\ni just realized these stupid watchers had\r\nnot known that ilsa was with me. they had\r\nthought that i was the only one. just as\r\nwell, if they had known, they would\'ve\r\nkilled her.\r\n\r\nboris explained to me this dimension. it\r\ndoes not travel. when another dimension\r\nis adjacent to it, this dimension overlaps\r\nthe other. if a sentient being happens to\r\nbe on the exact point of overlap, and this\r\nsentient being is an inquisitive sort, he\r\nis sucked through into this one.\r\n#end\r\n:k\r\nhad an argument with boris over whether it\r\nwas right to kill the more successful ones\r\nthe ones that actually found the exit and\r\nused it. it makes the rest of the \r\nwanderers fearful. most of the wanderers,\r\nespecially adrian, despise me for some\r\nreason.\r\n#end\r\n:l\r\ni have built a vacuum cleaner for the\r\nwatchers. they are especially pleased with\r\nit, in their pocket dimension, they have\r\nno such minds as mine, the mechanical \r\nmind. they say that i should start build-\r\ning more for them.\r\n#end\r\n:m \r\nboris explained to me that this dimension\r\nis actually a game, made by invisible\r\noutsiders for enjoyment. the watchers say\r\nthat they have never seen these \r\nur-watchers. i find it humorous. watchers\r\nbeing watched. \r\n\r\nboris said that the purpose of this game\r\nis to be killed by watchers while trying\r\nto find the exit. i find *that* futile.\r\nis dying considered winning? but if one\r\nwanders around this dimension for an \r\neternity, have they won the game?\r\n#end\r\n:n\r\nboris has given me plans for a device\r\nhe could not explain. i looked at them.\r\nthey are brilliant. i will not tell the\r\nwatchers, but i have devised a way from\r\nthese plans to make an escape route\r\nfor myself. a simple catapult, that will,\r\nif you will, catapult me into an adjacent\r\ndimension. all or nothing. ilsa has \r\nwritten me several letters that somehow\r\nflew into this one. this gives me reason\r\nto believe that my home dimension is\r\nalligned.\r\n#end\r\n:o\r\nbloody work. i had to kill a rankallan \r\nthat ate too many wanderers. the plumbing\r\nin the men\'s bathroom went out. i can\'t\r\nfind the glyph that opens the laboratory,\r\ni left it in the soap factory. reazles\r\nhave overtaken the gallery. these mundane\r\nsubjects distract me from my major ob-\r\njective. and the interdimensional workman\r\nhas just delivered an exquisite painting\r\nfor me.\r\n#end\r\n:p\r\nhave finished the transdimensional cata-\r\npult. it is done.\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>The keeper\'s diary in interesting as it drops so many hints for the game\'s puzzles that it\'s very much like its own subtle walkthrough \r\nfor much of the game. To summarize, jenner and isla were brought to the tower together, and actually managed to find the exit. Isla ran out \r\nand jenner stayed behind, having grown tolerant of life in the tower\'s dimension. Eventually one of the watchers discovered jenner and made \r\nthem the new keykeeper. Upon learning that exiting normally means certain death, and that an alternate means of exiting safely could be \r\ncreated jenner planned their escape.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_034.png\'%}\" alt=\"034\">\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing deeper into the library brings the player to a large bookshelf. The use of half solid characters in varying colors like this \r\nwas a very common way to create bookshelves. In a bit of an issue with continuity, the player immediately comments on not being able to \r\nfind a dictionary, but no dictionary has been mentioned, until investigating the torn out pages of a diary in the corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_035.png\'%}\" alt=\"035\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_036.png\'%}\" alt=\"036\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player is thus informed about a dictionary that will let them communicate with those who only speak izanuoylrak\'ian. It also \r\nprovides a bit of insight onto the ya\'yono vekka seen at the start of the player\'s journey. This diary also reiterates the importance of \r\nthe eight gems which can be found in the game in order to obtain the special ending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we\'ll see, obtaining the eight gems without using a walkthrough or peeking in the editor is a gargantuan task. Even Foxman who wrote \r\nthe game\'s walkthrough admitted to not knowing where one of the gems is. I\'m confident that nobody got the secret ending without cheating \r\nin some way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to find the dictionary, it may be wise to ask the librarian for some help.</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}\r\nyou come up to the librarian and he greets\r\nyou in izanuoylrak\'ian:\r\n\r\n$librarian: golmox rahutay skryll?        \r\n\r\nyou: hello... i... uh...\r\n\r\n$&lt;you are suddenly reminded that you need\r\n$a dictionary...&gt;\r\n\r\nyou: izanuoylrak... yes? yes?\r\n\r\nyou (thinking): good... i think he under-\r\nstands *that* much... what\'s this? it \r\nseems he wants a trade...\r\n/i\r\n$maa... maanhg... mango.                  \r\n\r\nhe wants a mango for a measly dictionary?\r\nwhere the hell do i find a *mango*?\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>And with that the player gets their first task. Find a mango, receive a dictionary. The back of the library contains nothing of \r\ninterest, just a few open books on a shelf. It\'s time to move on down the tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_045.png\'%}\" alt=\"045\">\r\n\r\n<p>The southwest tower board foreshadows some lower balconies that the player will eventually be able to explore. On the current level, \r\nthere\'s a large shrub and a creature standing near it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_047.png\'%}\" alt=\"047\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_048.png\'%}\" alt=\"048\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_045.png\'%}\" alt=\"045\">\r\n\r\n<p>One thing worth pointing out here, is the interesting shading on the tower displayed here. It uses the standard ZZT fade of solid -&gt; \r\nnormal -&gt; breakable -&gt; water -&gt; repeat which is used normally in the skyline in the background, but on the tower itself it\'s \r\nhandled a little differently. There are these sort of vertical seams created which help add some roundness to the shape of the tower. This \r\nis done by taking advantage of how normal walls and water tiles are the inverse of each other graphically. So a dark purple on dark blue \r\nnormal looks almost but not exactly like a dark blue on dark purple water. This creates the seam when you put the two next to each other \r\nand is a really cool effect that I don\'t think I\'ve seen used anywhere else in this manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_049.png\'%}\" alt=\"049\"> \r\n\r\n<p>The entrance to the main hub of the tower is the next screen. This room also has the first solvable puzzle, and immediately requires you \r\nto get into Pop\'s mindset. The game\'s included text file even tells you how to solve it, which is generous because it\'s already not the \r\nmost intuitive solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_051.png\'%}\" alt=\"051\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_052.png\'%}\" alt=\"052\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_057.png\'%}\" alt=\"057\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_060.png\'%}\" alt=\"060\">\r\n\r\n<p>Investigating the statue brings up a few interesting choices of what to do to it. You can go down the list and get various reactions, \r\nbut until you insult it enough, it won\'t do anything. ZZT games rarely required repeated interactions like this so even just getting the \r\nstatue to wake up can be a challenge. And when it does, you begin a fortunately slow chase.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_061.png\'%}\" alt=\"061\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_062.png\'%}\" alt=\"062\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_063.png\'%}\" alt=\"063\">\r\n\r\n<p>With the statue slowly chasing the player, they\'ll have to move over to a large drill, activate it, and lure the statue to its demise. \r\nAll of this is a very elaborate method of obtaining a rock. The player can also activate the drill in advance, but the statue does move \r\nslowly enough that it\'s not necessary to pace back and forth across the board for added safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Murder count: 1</b></p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_067.png\'%}\" alt=\"067\">\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than proceed inside the tower, I continued down the path. There\'s a lot to take in on this board. Like the dead body! But first \r\nlet\'s get ourselves killed by a coke machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_068.png\'%}\" alt=\"068\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_069.png\'%}\" alt=\"069\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_070.png\'%}\" alt=\"070\">\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, a second game with coke machines in it. Unlike Deep December\'s commitment to brand ideals, in the world of Pop, vending machines \r\ncan be far deadlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_072.png\'%}\" alt=\"072\">\r\n\r\n<p>You can safely spit in it though.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_074.png\'%}\" alt=\"074\">\r\n\r\n<p>Next in line is a parakeet. Just like the statue and coke machine there\'s a variety of options to choose from.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_075.png\'%}\" alt=\"075\">\r\n\r\n<p>Talking to the parakeet makes the dead body up ahead go from suicide to murder. Attempting to kill the parakeet yourself is met with a \r\nmessage about how it refuses to give you the chance. You\'re also unable to offer it any food regardless of what\'s in your inventory.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_076.png\'%}\" alt=\"076\">\r\n\r\n<p>Offering it a gem which you don\'t have will cause it to fly away, which it actually does by moving up and across the screen to the edge \r\nbefore disappearing, which is a pleasant detail rather than simply making the object #die and vanish on the spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the player does have a gem, the parakeet will take it before leaving, thus preventing the special ending from being possible. It\'s a \r\npretty needless design decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_080.png\'%}\" alt=\"080\">\r\n\r\n<p>The victim is revealed to be a maid, and the circumstances of her death are mysterious, but will ultimately go unexamined in the \r\nplayer\'s quest for the exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_081.png\'%}\" alt=\"081\">\r\n\r\n<p>The last board of the tower\'s exterior is the guava groves. This board has quite a bit to interact with despite its small accessible \r\narea.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_082.png\'%}\" alt=\"082\">\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly is the goal of the dictionary quest, a mango on the tree. Unfortunately there\'s no way to remove it currently.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_084.png\'%}\" alt=\"084\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_083.png\'%}\" alt=\"083\">\r\n\r\n<p>Next is this viewing lens. Without any gems there\'s not really anything the player can do with it yet either.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_085.png\'%}\" alt=\"085\">\r\n\r\n<p>Attempting to pick the mushroom causes the hûdû atop the tree to run down and bite you for trying to steal their mushroom. So we are 0 \r\nfor 3. What a productive trip to the guava groves. Time to backtrack and enter the tower proper.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_088.png\'%}\" alt=\"088\">\r\n\r\n<p>The board has a really cool perspective, simultaneously showing both the inside and outside of the tower. It uses transporters which \r\nblend into the walls to let the player transition from the outer section to the inner.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_089.png\'%}\" alt=\"089\">\r\n\r\n<p>Talking to the gatehouse-keeper gives you a prompt to give him your name. Each option gets a slightly different response, but none of \r\nthem have any effect on how the conversation proceeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_085.png\'%}\" alt=\"085\">\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}@sir lugg\r\nso... anyways, my name\'s sir martin lugg,\r\nfor ye... been gatehouse keeper o\' this\r\nhere tower for past sevendy nine years..\r\n \r\nbeen ups and downs, lately. don\'t think\r\nof yourself as the only bright eyed\r\nyoung-un to come through these doors,\r\nsniffing every crack...\r\n\r\n$you &lt;a big ignorantly&gt;: seventy nine     \r\n$years!                                   \r\n\r\nsir lugg: that\'s it for ye... i\'ve been\r\nsearching a way outta these damned\r\ntowers for years... it\'s all mazes and \r\njunk...\r\n\r\n$you: c\'mon... surely you remember which  \r\n$way you came in...                       \r\n\r\nsir lugg: do you?\r\n\r\n$you: well... i, uh... er...              \r\n\r\nsir lugg: zackly the point. people come\r\nin, don\'t come out. firstmaster \r\njenner allus takes care of \'em. gives\r\nem jobs, or \'e just takes \'em down\r\nto the basement... they don\'t come up\r\nfrom there either...\r\n\r\n$you: sounds like something my grandfather\r\n$told me during a thunderstorm...         \r\n\r\nsir lugg: ain\'t no tale, sonny. it\'s real.\r\nany case, jenner\'s a kind soul. \'e\'s\r\njust a bit confused...\r\n\r\n!a1;confused?\r\n!b1;i see...\r\n#end\r\n:a1\r\n  \r\nyes, son, confused. \'e built this place...\r\ntalked to me a spell or so... a long\r\nwhile, tried to see things through\r\nwith me... said i was one of the smarter\r\nones... hell, he even told me i\'d \r\nbe runnin\' the place once he kicked back..\r\n\r\n \'e said it was a trap. y\'know, the way\r\na spider web gets \'em chiggers, the\r\ntowers were meant to get curious folks\r\nlike yerself... never said what \'e\'d\r\ndo to \'em, just said he liked company\r\nof thinkers, then.\r\n\r\n#end\r\n:b1\r\nwell, been nice talking to you... come\r\nback sometime soon.\r\n#end\r\n\r\n:touch\r\nsir martin vendul lugg looks up \r\nexpectantly...\r\n\r\n!a2;so, could you let me into the tower?\r\n!b2;what sort of language do they speak?\r\n!c2;what does master jenner look like?\r\n!d2;what are those statues for?\r\n\r\n#end\r\n:a2\r\nwell, e\'er since about two weeks ago,\r\nthose there mushrooms blocked up the\r\npassage to the tower... vicious mushrooms.\r\nye\'d best watch out for \'em.\r\n#end\r\n:b2\r\nizanuoylrak\'ian. like from around the\r\nheptagonal sea. it\'s hard to git, but\r\nyou can hold a conversation fer a spell\r\nif you\'ve got a dictionary...\r\n#end\r\n:c2\r\ni dunno, \'is face keeps changin\'... one\r\nthing, you\'ll recognize \'im by \'is eyes..\r\nyes, them eyes...\r\n#end\r\n:d2\r\none\'s justice. and one\'s the weasel...\r\n\r\n$you: the weasel?                         \r\n\r\nyep... justice is blind, y\'see, so \r\nthe weasel does the seeing, and justice\r\nacts upon \'is eyes... rather unfair. \r\njustice makes some mighty bad decisions\r\nthat way...\r\n#end\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s quite a conversation to be had with the gatekeeper. Again the dictionary is stressed as being something to get sooner rather \r\nthan later.

In order to balance justice\'s scales, something needs to weigh down the lighter one. This is where the \r\nrock from the statue comes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_108.png\'%}\" alt=\"108\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_110.png\'%}\" alt=\"110\">\r\n\r\n<p>With the mushrooms gone, the player can now enter the tower, though two of the passages are blocked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the carpet at the entrance, is a large piece of cheese and a rat quite interested in it, but other than that there\'s no interaction \r\nbetween the two objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/pop/pop_113.png\'%}\" alt=\"113\">\r\n\r\n<p>What might appear to be a passage on the painting is in fact an inscription, revealing it to be a painting by isla to jenner. Jenner\'s \r\ndiary mentioned that isla had been able to send messages from their home dimension into the tower\'s since the two were aligned. The hint \r\ngiven here isn\'t readily apparent, but will come into play later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out if you look at the inscription a second time, you\'ll find out there\'s a note on the back of it which mentions that the two \r\nof them had a secret room in the library and that isla has a surprise there for jenner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some ZZT games would put passages on picture frames as a way to take the player to a board where they could view the painting and \r\nnothing else which is what I was expecting here.

Since this game predates external editors, there\'s no way to find \r\nout how large your board is unless you export it to its own file. To make matters worse, though ZZT\'s file format will support a 32 KB \r\nboard, in practice ZZT has issues with boards at around 20 KB. There\'s no real exact size threshold to avoid crossing, but 20 KB became the \r\nmark to keep things under. If you go beyond this limit, you\'ll increase the chances of your board being corrupted when saving, or objects \r\nhaving their code randomly deleted.

Check out \r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/19990222093126/http://members.xoom.com/t0ucan/\" target=\"_blank\">the cosmic melon</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that\'s Pop!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went into this game remembering that it was a hit when it was released, and that I never got anywhere in it at the time. My thoughts \r\non the game as a whole are really all over the place. The archived version of Tucan\'s site leads me to believe this game was made by a \r\n13 year old, and when you realize that, it pulls up the game\'s flaws and makes what it does well more impressive. There\'s a very good sense \r\nof being brought to a strange world, and that world is built cohesively. The giant early dumps of information could be handled a bit \r\nbetter, but it does ensure that if the player takes what they\'re told to heart, they\'ll have a much easier time progressing through the \r\ntower grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visually, the game has a well-crafted aesthetic. Boards like the entrance hallway\'s inside/outside perspective really give a sense of \r\ndepth compared to just a simple rectangle for a room. There\'s plenty of animation as well, birds flying away, drills operating, simple \r\ntouches that help bring the boards to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think my biggest complaint about Pop would have to be the constant backtracking. In this article I had the luxury of just cutting from \r\none board to another, but in gameplay you\'ll find yourself running across large empty boards many times. It\'s made worse if you aren\'t \r\ntaking advantage of the walkthrough as a wrong hunch on how to solve a puzzle can waste a few minutes of your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pop\'s puzzles themselves also aren\'t the best. You\'ll have a harder time getting into the tower than anything else in the game. There \r\nare also the moments of inconsistencies like not being able to give the librarian the mango unless you lured the frog with it, or only \r\nbeing able to use the sink in one of the bathrooms to find the glyph in the soap when the other can\'t be interacted with at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a fun game here, but a slow one. The characters are fun to talk to, and there\'s a sense of humor about everything while also \r\nmaintaining enough of a serious mystery. The ending is hyped up throughout the game, and I found myself curious about how the game would \r\nactually end. It kept me motivated enough, and just as the game began to wear thin it was time to end it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sidequest for the gems meanwhile, is a mess. First of all, the game is bugged so you can\'t actually get all the gems, but then most \r\nof the gems doing things repeatedly that do nothing over and over again until suddenly it works and you\'re rewarded. Nobody is going to \r\nkick a vending machine five times when kicking it a second time says the same thing as the first time. The guy who says 50 things may be \r\npointless, but there\'s at least knowledge that every time you talk to him, you get something different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you read through this before deciding to play Pop, well, there\'s not all that much to see that you haven\'t already here. It\'s a \r\ndecently put together adventure game, a genre in ZZT that\'s a bit lacking, and that gives it an edge as something noteworthy. Playing along \r\nwith the walkthrough can make the game move forward at a fast enough pace that it could certainly be an enjoyable experience just journeying \r\nthrough the strange dimension that Tucan created. Playing it blind I feel will really suck the excitement out of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For an amateur adventure game by a 13 year old, Pop does a pretty solid job, but pitting it against the adventure game genre as a whole \r\nwould be asking too much of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-09-28',1,'django',4,177,'',''),(181,'Closer Look: Merbotia','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Merbotia</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n<div class=\"c\" style=\"border-bottom:1px dotted #000\">\r\nBy: Sonic256<br>\r\nReleased: Nov. 22, 1995<br>\r\nWhere to get it:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=merbotia.zip\" target=\"_blank\">Download from z2</a> |\r\n<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_merbotia\" target=\"_blank\">Play on Archive.org</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Merbotia is a game that\'s a bit of an outlier among the well-received games that have been covered so far. It\'s very iconic among \r\nZZTers. Popular enough that nearly everybody in the community has played it, but at the same time an incredibly short and simple adventure \r\nthat really only has its sense of humor going for it. Not that it\'s a bad game by any means. It\'s just a very \r\nstraightforward adventure one could finish over a lunch break. Despite this, it won the June 2000 Classic Game of the Month Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how did Merbotia manage to become a game so many within the community were familiar with? The CGOTM review written by Hydra78 \r\nexplains it:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"l\" style=\"background:#DDD;padding:1em;font-style:italic;\">\r\nThose of you that don\'t get nostalgic feelings just by looking at this game\'s funky title screen probably won\'t agree with me :). \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>And quite frankly, he is absolutely right. Merbotia\'s title screen music is probably the most recognized tune composed in ZZT. Give it a \r\nlisten.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FKCzIkORJgY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s very catchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_001.png\'%}\" alt=\"001\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game opens with the player in a small dwelling carved into a mountain. By late 1995, Super Tool Kit colors in games started becoming \r\nmuch more common, with nearly everything on the board being a previously unusable dark color.

He is feared\r\nby every corner of Merbotia, and wanted\r\nDEAD by just about ever living thing on\r\nthis planet.\r\n/i\r\n$But Planets don\'t have corners...\r\nWhy not???\r\n$Planets are ROUND, aren\'t they???\r\nOf course not! What makes you think that?\r\n$Well, there were many explorers who...\r\nOh, shut up. Ten thousand Merbotians can\'t\r\nbe wrong!\r\n/i\r\nSo anyway, your quest is to journey to\r\n*Quatsch*\'s cavern in eastern Merbotia.\r\n$Why should I?\r\nWell, why SHOULDN\'T you?\r\n$Ummm... Good point.\r\nNow get on your way!\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>With that the player is given their quest, as well as the origins of the earth and mankind. Find and kill Quatsch.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_018.png\'%}\" alt=\"018\">\r\n\r\n<p>You\'re then forcefully shoved out of the room and back into the starting section of the cave. This is done by repeatedly #putting \r\nboulders in the direction of the player to push them along. In ZZT-OOP, some commands are cycle ending and some are not. If an object is \r\ntold to #go n and then #go s, it will stop processing its code for the cycle after it moves to the north. This makes sense for movement \r\nsince if both lines were processed in a single cycle the object would appear to stand still. Interestingly, #put isn\'t cycle ending, which \r\nmeans you could produce a long line of pushable items instantaneously. The concept of non-cycle ending almost never comes up in ZZT since \r\nrarely can the behavior be manipulated usefully. Pushing the player is one of its few uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_020.png\'%}\" alt=\"020\">\r\n\r\n<p>The forest is basically what you can expect the majority of the game to play like. You\'ve got some lions, and some ammo. Shoot them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though, at the same time this board does a nice job showing a slow growth in complexity and polish in ZZT worlds. Plenty of games had \r\nforests with lions and ammo to shoot them with. Prior to STK there wouldn\'t have been any grass made out of fake walls (unless it was a \r\nblinding bright green filling the screen). There\'s also the dark cyan Ä object. Rather than fill the board with ammo, taking up space that \r\ncould be put to better use, and taking up the player\'s time to collect it, instead an object is used, represented as a quiver of arrows and \r\ngiving the player 20 ammo. The bushes are actually objects (though they don\'t look it), which when touched will tell you that they are in \r\nfact bushes (or shrubbery or large bushes..).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my playthrough I managed to completely miss the oddly colored wall just west of the quiver. Touching it reveals a lever the player \r\ncan pull. Doing so unlocks the southern door in the starting cave, providing more ammo and health to the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_022.png\'%}\" alt=\"022\">\r\n\r\n<p>Heading north is more of the same. Ruffians instead of lions, and this time some flowers scattered about.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_024.png\'%}\" alt=\"024\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_025.png\'%}\" alt=\"025\">\r\n\r\n<p>Don\'t patronize them though.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_026.png\'%}\" alt=\"026\">\r\n\r\n<p>The northwest corner of the forest has a cave the player can enter, and nothing else.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_028.png\'%}\" alt=\"028\">\r\n\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the cave is dark. Fortunately the player starts right by a torch and there are several more scattered throughout the \r\nroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_030.png\'%}\" alt=\"30\">\r\n\r\n<p>The cave is devoid of enemies, containing nothing but gems, torches, and these health kits which restore 25 health. The whole room is \r\noptional and just a reward for deciding to explore the forest rather than heading straight to Quatsch.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_034.png\'%}\" alt=\"34\">\r\n\r\n<p>The southwest corner of the forest is a more mountainous region with large boulders and centipedes, as well as another pile of \r\narrows.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_035.png\'%}\" alt=\"35\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_036.png\'%}\" alt=\"36\">\r\n\r\n<p>If the player has a sharp eye they may notice the small round button in the lower left area which changes all the centipedes on the \r\nscreen into gems.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_038.png\'%}\" alt=\"38\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_040.png\'%}\" alt=\"40\">\r\n\r\n<p>Heading to the southeast section of the forest is the entrance to Quatsch\'s Lair, prominently displayed on a very large sign.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_043.png\'%}\" alt=\"43\">\r\n\r\n<p>Venturing into the cave you get this intricately carved maze that looks like something out of Pac-Man. This board plays a ZZT rendition \r\nof the Super Mario Bros. underground music while you\'re on it. It\'s not too bad of a conversion.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_045.png\'%}\" alt=\"45\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_046.png\'%}\" alt=\"46\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_047.png\'%}\" alt=\"47\">\r\n\r\n<p>It takes no time at all to get to Quatsch. He doesn\'t shoot attack you directly, rather just very rapidly starts producing lots of lions \r\nand bears. At first glance it looks pretty intimidating, there are a lot of enemies at all times, and while the player has a good supply of \r\nammo, it can be tough to get through all the creatures to actually hit Quatsch himself. It looks like it\'s going to be a tough fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_048.png\'%}\" alt=\"48\">\r\n\r\n<p>Then you managed to hit him once and all the creatures on screen turn into ammo and gems, meaning you\'ll be able to keep shooting and \r\nregain health. One cool concept that I don\'t think I\'ve seen many boss fights in ZZT use is the placement of a ricochet when you shoot \r\nQuatsch. It prevents the player from just spamming a long line of bullets and hitting him repeatedly, forcing you to instead hold back on \r\nyour shooting a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_053.png\'%}\" alt=\"53\">\r\n\r\n<p>Another aspect of his simple coding is that he\'ll try and put enemies anywhere, which can replace walls with lions. After shooting him \r\nseveral times and getting nowhere, I noticed the large pile of bombs amassing on the left side of the screen. Every time you shoot him, a \r\nbomb spawns. They slowly get pushed into the main arena allowing you to actually defeat Quatsch with a single bomb.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"54\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_055.png\'%}\" alt=\"55\">\r\n\r\n<p>With your quest complete, you could just return to the start and let that person know you\'re done, but Sonic256 isn\'t one to hold the \r\nplayer back from indulging in some corpse desecration.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_056.png\'%}\" alt=\"56\">\r\n<br>\r\n<b class=\"c\">Spit on it</b><br>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_057.png\'%}\" alt=\"57\">\r\n\r\n<br><b class=\"c\">Kick it</b><br>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_059.png\'%}\" alt=\"59\">\r\n\r\n<br><b class=\"c\">Jump on it</b><br>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_060.png\'%}\" alt=\"60\">\r\n\r\n<p>Merbotia likes to make sure the player always has options.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/merbotia/merbotia_061.png\'%}\" alt=\"61\">\r\n\r\n<p> Once the player leaves the cave after defeating Quatsch, the entrance crumbles and they can never return.

You realize that you don\'t\r\nhave a quarter, and begin to walk to where\r\nthe phone book claims his address is.\r\n/i\r\nOn the way, you get mugged by a group of\r\nfive people. Instead of giving them your\r\nmoney, you pull out that strange gun you\r\nfound on the ship, and chop off various\r\nlimbs of theirs with your excellent\r\nmarksmanship.\r\n/i\r\nYou finally arrive at his house.\r\nAn old man greets you with a Shotgun.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you.\" he states.\r\n\r\n$Is... Is Charles There?\r\n\r\n\"I am Charles.\" he says.\r\n\r\n$Remember me? It\'s your old pal, Player!\r\n\r\n\"Player?\" he thinks. \"Is that you?\"\r\n\r\nHe lets you in.\r\n\r\nYou both hug for a very long time, before\r\nyou ask him,\r\n\r\n$\"What happened to you? How\'d you get so\r\n$old? Where are my parents?\"\r\n\r\nYour parents died 7 years ago in a car\r\naccident. You didn\'t even show up at their\r\nfuneral. Don\'t you remember anything?\r\n\r\n$\"If this is your idea of a joke, then...\"\r\n\r\nYou happen to glance at a newspaper by his\r\nfoot. It reads 2074.\r\n\r\nYour mind races. What were my parents\r\nlike? Where is my sister? What became of\r\nher? Why didn\'t I age with them?\r\n\r\nYou collapse on the floor, your heart\r\naching. Your brother stands there\r\nconfused, and helpless. You are rushed to\r\nthe hospital, but it is too late. You die\r\nof a heartattack.\r\n\r\n2 days later, in the obituary section of\r\nthe New York Times, your name is there.\r\n\r\n$Player.\r\n$Died of Heart Failure at the age of 104.\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>Worth noting is that when you land on earth you actually lose a large amount of health. There\'s supposed to be an :ending2 label to jump \r\nto if you don\'t have enough to survive the crash, but it\'s not programmed in. Similarly, getting mugged and having zero ammo left causes \r\nyou to get beat up and possibly killed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And with that, the game ends. It\'s a very dark ending compared to the silly mood the rest of the game had. Earth sucks, and your whole \r\nquest kind of ruined your chances at leading a normal life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from its grim ending, Merbotia\'s got a lot of charm to it. The writing is humorous, and while a lot of the jokes don\'t hold up to\r\na more mature audience, there are still a few good lines scattered throughout. It\'s short enough that it\'s simplistic gameplay doesn\'t get \r\na chance to drag the game down. Sonic256 never released any other games for ZZT which is a shame. Merbotia feels like a good first step in \r\nthe process of making ZZT games, but there never was a second here.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-10-08',1,'django',2,181,'',''),(183,'Closer Look: The Lost Monkeys','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get The Lost Monkeys?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lost Monkeys is available on\r\n<a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=lostmonk.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_lostmonk\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Lost Monkeys</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Chris Jong<br>\r\nReleased: Apr. 21, 1993\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lost Monkeys is about as iconic of early ZZT games as a ZZT game can get. It\'s bright, colorful, and also clearly a labor of love. I\r\npicked this game for an article since I remember it showing up on a lot of smaller ZZT sites I\'d find in the late 90s, seeing that it won a\r\nClassic Game of the Month award on z2, and I knew I had played it several times without ever finishing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn\'t expecting a lot from The Lost Monkeys. I figured it would be a short game about exploring an island and shooting some lions and\r\ntigers, finding said monkeys and being done with it. Instead, currently out of all the games I\'ve (re)played for these articles, this one\r\nwas absolutely the most enjoyable. In the later years of ZZT, complexity was king, but this simple by the book game from 1993 holds up\r\nincredibly well today. It\'s not perfect, and when you run into its flaws, they\'re pretty severe, but it exudes so much charm that I highly\r\nrecommend that you take a little bit of time and try it out yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment of writing, I don\'t know how old Chris Jong was when he made this game. If I had to guess, I would say 12. It definitely\r\nfeels like the kind of adventure a child would make both in terms of game design as well as the numerous spelling mistakes in the game\'s\r\ndialog.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/inventory.png\'%}\" alt=\"inventory\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game includes a word document which opens with a suggestion to have a printed out copy with you when you play. There\'s not really\r\nany need for it, as the boards aren\'t the difficult to navigate without any aid, and your inventory generally goes untouched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second page is a catalog listing the other games Chris had released. There are a total of 14 games listed! As well as a few demos of\r\nthose games. It\'s a massive amount of output for one person, especially since ZZT was no more than 2 years old when this game was released.\r\nChris promises to put as many of his games on a disk as can fit for $5.00 to handle postage, or suggests you find them on your local\r\nBBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final page suggests that you register The Lost Monkeys for $10.00 to receive a hintbook, maps, and more of his games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always wonder how successful these endeavors were. Especially for younger authors where even making $50 off a game they made would\r\nmake them feel like they were a huge success and professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n\r\n<p>Done with the documentation, it\'s time to actually take a look at the game itself. This game was released prior to the creation of Super\r\nTool Kit, so its graphics are going to be very bright out of necessity. The lack of STK also means black borders around the L-shaped banana\r\nand the half blocks that make up the E in monkeys. Despite the limited graphics, Chris makes good use of text as a way to produce some dark\r\nsolid coloring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game is credited on the title screen to Digital Reality, a ZZT company I am otherwise unfamiliar with. ZZT companies of course, are\r\nnot actual companies paying people to make ZZT games. They\'re just a loose collective of individuals who can reasonably count on other\r\ncompany members to help with their games, by contributing graphics and music, as well as beta testing. There were a lot of ZZT companies\r\nover the years, and most were pretty forgettable. I can\'t name any other members or games released under Digital Reality, and there\'s\r\nunfortunately no easy way to find them short of manually looking at every ZZT world out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_001.png\'%}\" alt=\"001\">\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the company being mentioned, the game\'s opening credits mention only Chris Jong. Most ZZT games were one man shows for\r\neverything except maybe testing, company or not. In the corner there\'s a simple two frame animation of a hammer hitting a strongman game\r\nletting you know to expect a five out of five in quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_002.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen gives the player their motivation. Once again text is used to get brown when it would otherwise be impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_004.png\'%}\" alt=\"004\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_005.png\'%}\" alt=\"005\">\r\n\r\n<p>The gameplay begins with a quick exposition. The monkeys ran off, you\'re in charge of finding them. I love that \"an ending\" is a bullet\r\npoint on the game\'s features. There\'s also the first of many reminders to register your shareware.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_003.png\'%}\" alt=\"003\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player is then set on their boat, just off the coast of the game\'s first\r\nisland, \"Monkeys Pleasure\". Objects representing bubbles, move along the screen\r\nas a way to convey a sense of movement across the ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the lower left area of the boat is a sack containing supplies the player\r\nwill need on their journey: Ammunition, silk torches, healing pills, some rope,\r\nand a banana.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_010.png\'%}\" alt=\"010\">\r\n\r\n<p>On the right side is a panel showing the boat\'s current status. It\'s just a\r\nfun bit of flavor with a simple illustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_012.png\'%}\" alt=\"012\">\r\n\r\n<p>At the ship\'s steering wheel, the player can increase power to the engines,\r\ncausing the bubbles in the waves to start moving even faster. There are also\r\noptions to open the ship\'s hatch, or activate the emergency eject system.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_013.png\'%}\" alt=\"013\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_014.png\'%}\" alt=\"014\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_015.png\'%}\" alt=\"015\">\r\n\r\n<p>Activating the emergency exit results in suddenly being thrown from the ship\r\nto your immediate demise. So try not to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_017.png\'%}\" alt=\"017\">\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the player is supposed to open the hatch and swim the rest of the\r\nway to Monkeys Pleasure. Having the boat still appear to be in motion kind of\r\nbreaks the immersion here, but some time from now the ability to leave the boat\r\nlike this will be explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_019.png\'%}\" alt=\"019\">\r\n\r\n<p>Having made it to land, the player is free to explore the island. It consists\r\nof a large area, taking up eight whole boards for the first area of the game,\r\nbut is mostly empty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This board in particular highlights most of what you\'ll find on Monkeys\r\nPleasure. Banana trees and a white mountain range. As I mentioned before in my earlier\r\narticle on <a href=\"https://pokyfriends.com/blog/25/640x350x16-a-history-of-zzts-graphics\" target=\"_blank\">ZZT\'s graphical limitations</a>\r\nand how people got around them, it\'s worth looking at how this screen in\r\nparticular manages to produce shadows and shading using only what ZZT can\r\nproduce naturally. The graphics in The Lost Monkeys really come together to\r\ncreate a colorful jungle environment for the player to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_020.png\'%}\" alt=\"020\">\r\n\r\n<p>North of the banana trees is this board which is split in two by the\r\nmountain range. On the left half is the professor\'s hut, where Adam and Daisy\r\nran off from. The mountain division is completely unnecessary from a gameplay\r\nperspective, but works quite nicely aesthetically.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_022.png\'%}\" alt=\"022\">\r\n\r\n<p>The hut is furnished rather abstractly. There\'s a bathroom with a (flushable) toilet and\r\nshower; a living room with a television (playing an ad espousing the benefits of\r\nregistering The Lost Monkeys) and a hanging picture of Professor Dave; a bedroom\r\nwith a desk and bed; and lastly a kitchen containing a sink, fridge, and\r\nProfessor Dave himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_023.png\'%}\" alt=\"023\"><br>\r\n\r\n<b class=\"c\">What\'s it worth?</b><br>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_024.png\'%}\" alt=\"024\"><br>\r\n\r\n<b class=\"c\">No.</b><br>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_025.png\'%}\" alt=\"025\"><br>\r\n\r\n<b class=\"c\">Of course professor!</b><br>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_026.png\'%}\" alt=\"026\">\r\n\r\n<p>For accepting the task, the player is given a large quantity of money, the\r\nmajority of which is required in order to get the plane engine and manual.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"054\">\r\n\r\n<p>On the eastern coast of Monkeys Pleasure is the store that the professor\r\nmentioned. It\'s very clearly above ground, unless it\'s supposed to be taken as a\r\nblack market? Though nothing inside seems to indicate it as being illegitimate\r\nin any way.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_055.png\'%}\" alt=\"055\">\r\n\r\n<p>The inside of the store is decorated with flickering candles and lined with\r\nempty shelves. Anything you can purchase must be bought directly from the\r\nstore\'s clerk.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_056.png\'%}\" alt=\"056\">\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the empty shelves, there\'s quite a lot of choices to be made. Though\r\n575 of the 600 gem budget the player has needs to be spent on the plane\'s engine\r\nand the manual to learn how to fly it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This store demonstrates an issue The Lost Monkeys has and shares with many\r\nother ZZT games. It\'s impossible to know if you should be spending your money on\r\nsupplies, or if you need to save it for a mandatory purchase later. Gems in ZZT\r\ngames are limited, and if you spend too much you run into the risk of\r\nsoftlocking the game. It\'s all too easy to make the player afraid of spending\r\nmoney, and thus having a more challenging game without being able to rely on any\r\nshops present.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_061.png\'%}\" alt=\"061\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_062.png\'%}\" alt=\"062\">\r\n\r\n<p>After making the necessary purchases, I headed to the northeast corner of the\r\nisland where the door to the plane could be found.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_063.png\'%}\" alt=\"063\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_064.png\'%}\" alt=\"064\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_065.png\'%}\" alt=\"065\">\r\n\r\n<p>With the key in place, the player can make their way to the airplane and\r\nbegin their search for the missing monkeys proper.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_068.png\'%}\" alt=\"068\">\r\n\r\n<p>Upon boarding the craft, stars pass by to give the illusion of flying through\r\nthe night sky.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_073.png\'%}\" alt=\"073\">\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, without installing the new engine there won\'t be any actual\r\ntravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_074.png\'%}\" alt=\"074\">\r\n\r\n<p>Installing it is simple enough, but there\'s no real indication that the rear\r\nof the plane is made up of objects and not just regular walls. You can see this\r\nstyle of object design in the professor\'s hut as well. It can be a bit difficult\r\nat times in The Lost Monkeys to realize when something is actually an object the\r\nplayer can interact with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the engine in place, it\'s time to go back on the plane and get off the\r\nisland.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_076.png\'%}\" alt=\"076\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_077.png\'%}\" alt=\"077\">\r\n\r\n<p>I of course immediately fire the plane\'s weaponry causing some red lasers to\r\ndart across the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_078.png\'%}\" alt=\"078\">\r\n\r\n<p>This... could be worded better. One the plane has reached the desired\r\naltitude, the door to the plane\'s map room opens and the player is free to\r\nchoose their next destination to search for Adam and Daisy on.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_079.png\'%}\" alt=\"079\">\r\n\r\n<p>The map room gives a view of the world the player will be exploring. There\r\nare six locations to explore, and though it\'s not made readily apparent, you\'ll\r\nhave to visit all of them in order to complete the quest.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>The Africa Jungle</li>\r\n    <li>Monkeys Pleasure</li>\r\n    <li>Woof Town</li>\r\n    <li>Banana Island</li>\r\n    <li>The Underground Caves</li>\r\n    <li></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>That last one doesn\'t have a name for some reason. The passage that you enter\r\nthe map from also doubles as a passage to a second store, a fact I was unaware\r\nof for the majority of my playthrough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having no real leads, I decide to start off with Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_087.png\'%}\" alt=\"087\">\r\n\r\n<p>After parachuting from the plane (leaving it to crash no doubt), the player\r\nlands in Africa. This is another board where I\'m in love with how it looks. It\r\nmust be the shadows on the trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_088.png\'%}\" alt=\"088\">\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, I\'m not in love with how it plays. The path is littered with\r\nobjects that blend into the scenery and cause an instant game over from quick\r\nsand if touched. You just have to slowly cross the board, constantly saving your\r\ngame to be able to progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_090.png\'%}\" alt=\"090\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen is the first board with some action on it. A river crossing\r\nwith dangerous piranha swimming within. ZZT has water and sharks that can swim\r\nin it, but the player can\'t move across it. Jong instead is forced to just use\r\nfake walls an objects, which means it\'s very much possible for the fish to get\r\nout of the water and continue swimming across the grass.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_093.png\'%}\" alt=\"093\">\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn\'t take much to get them to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_095.png\'%}\" alt=\"095\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_099.png\'%}\" alt=\"099\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen features a boss fight with a stereotypical jungle tribe. For\r\nthe most part, they just move around, shooting in the player\'s direction. Once\r\none gets shot, they throw a player-seeking star which means the player has to\r\nkeep moving. Since I like breaking games I did my best to get them to shoot each\r\nother and save me some ammo.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_105.png\'%}\" alt=\"105\">\r\n\r\n<p>It takes a very long time to actually defeat all of them, but they\'re not\r\nall that difficult. The scenery took a bit of damage from all the bullets that\r\nmissed their targets. Jong was wise enough to put some objects in the\r\nmountainous area to prevent the player from just tunneling through the breakable\r\nwalls and skipping the fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_106.png\'%}\" alt=\"106\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen features the source of the river crossed earlier as well as a\r\nlarge red building that\'s currently locked with a diamond shape in the middle of\r\nthe door. With nothing else to do here it\'s time to move on.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_109.png\'%}\" alt=\"109\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_110.png\'%}\" alt=\"110\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_111.png\'%}\" alt=\"111\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen is ominously empty, but it doesn\'t take long before\r\ndiscovering the danger: hidden land mines. Fortunately unlike the quicksand\r\nhitting one isn\'t an instant game over, just a loss of 10 health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The less than obvious shop on the map screen offers a mine detector for sale,\r\nbut these mines aren\'t coded to react to it. You can also shoot them to reveal\r\nthe mines safely from a distance, but most likely the player will think this is\r\nlike the quicksand screen and that there\'s nothing they can do about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, even if the mine detector did work here, there\'s no way to go back\r\nand buy one since the player parachutes onto the island and is committed to the\r\njungle until it\'s completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_114.png\'%}\" alt=\"114\">\r\n\r\n<p>On the last board of the Africa section of the game is a helicopter already\r\nprepared for takeoff. The blades animate and a surprisingly effective sound\r\neffect plays repeatedly on this screen as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_116.png\'%}\" alt=\"116\">\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s very apparent that Chris Jong had a lot of fun making vehicles for his\r\ngame. The copter blade can be seen spinning around and the side view continues\r\nthe animation from the previous board.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_116.png\'%}\" alt=\"117\">\r\n\r\n<p>Again there\'s a control panel that unlocks the map room. Despite there being\r\nmachine guns on the helicopter, unlike the airplane there\'s no way to fire\r\nthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_118.png\'%}\" alt=\"118\">\r\n\r\n<p>Africa was revealed to be a bust, but there are still four more locations to\r\nsearch for Adam and Daisy on. The 2nd island is Monkeys Pleasure where the game\r\nfirst began, so it\'s onward to Woof Town.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_119.png\'%}\" alt=\"119\">\r\n\r\n<p>Woof Town is surrounded by a large wall with patrolling guards that explain\r\nthey\'re making sure no wild beasts or enemies get in.

Once the player enters, the gate closes behind them, trapping\r\nthem inside. Each section of the room has a button which can be used to adjust\r\nthe doors. It\'s not really a puzzle, though the path you can take changes as you\r\npress the buttons, as you just need to hit each button to open the doors to the\r\nnext board.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_154.png\'%}\" alt=\"154\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_155.png\'%}\" alt=\"155\">\r\n\r\n<p>Our vehicle of choice for leaving Woof Town is a rocket ship.

The brown fakes and black on dark green boulders give away that this board\r\noriginally had torches and forests on it which were changed to fakes/boulders to\r\nget some uncommon colors for ZZT back in 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_159.png\'%}\" alt=\"159\">\r\n\r\n<p>The Bad Guy generally tries to move towards the player, so it\'s easy to keep\r\nhim pinned against walls like this.

By now I figured the way the game was structured was\r\nthat you could explore the six islands, and five of them were essentially\r\npointless, just wrong guesses as you picked your way through them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the next island was \"Banana Isle\" it seemed like the obvious choice for\r\nwhere to find the monkeys and complete the game. I decided I\'d explore the rest\r\nof the remaining islands in reverse order, so it was off to the unnamed island\r\nnumber six.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_176.png\'%}\" alt=\"176\"> \r\n\r\n<p>The sixth island puts the player on a beach with a cruise ship in the\r\ndistance and a ticket seller along the coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_179.png\'%}\" alt=\"179\">\r\n\r\n<p>The seller offers a choice on whether the player wants to buy or rent\r\nsomething, but there\'s nothing to rent. To get on the boat, the player needs an\r\nastonishing 500 gems. It\'s time to start hunting for a source of cash.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_182.png\'%}\" alt=\"182\">\r\n\r\n<p>How convenient.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_183.png\'%}\" alt=\"183\">\r\n\r\n<p>This part is easily the low point of the game. You need 50 gems to be able to\r\nbuy a pan for gold and then to buy access to the ocean where the gold can be\r\nfound. It\'s very possible to go here without enough money and be trapped on the\r\nisland with no way to proceed. I bought some brown water for health while still\r\nin Woof Town and just narrowly avoided such a situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_185.png\'%}\" alt=\"185\">\r\n\r\n<p>The ocean is full of invisible objects, but unlike the quicksand or landmines\r\nseen earlier, this time the player wants to run into them so they can pan for\r\nocean gold. (Are coastal gold deposits a thing?) You\'re on a time limit for this\r\nand it\'s not fun at all, just a glorified Where\'s Waldo.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/the-lost-monkeys/lostmon_186.png\'%}\" alt=\"186\">\r\n\r\n<p>With about a minute and ten seconds left on the timer, a missing idle\r\ndirection in the timer\'s code causes the script to break repeatedly, so you \r\nactually have infinite time for this sequence.

I love it, there\'s zero reason to believe you\'re in any danger after you\r\nget the monkeys back. Jong just wanted to draw another explosion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s a straightforward and happy ending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, The Lost Monkeys was a fun experience. For a game without proper STK\r\ncolors, the game looks gorgeous, and the little animations add quite a bit.\r\nThere\'s a lot in this game that makes it seems as if a young Chris Jong was just\r\nhaving a blast coming up with these areas. Tropical jungles, dangerous river\r\ncrossings, and monster filled caves all feel like unique locations to explore in\r\nyour search for Adam and Daisy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the game does stumble, is in its issues with providing the player with\r\nhints on what they need to be doing exactly. It\'s very easy to miss things like\r\nthe ocean gem or store with a detonator due to the lack of guidance that those\r\nareas can be accessed. Towards the end of this article I found out I missed two\r\nboards entirely, a secret north of the professor\'s cabin by shooting away the\r\nbreakable walls of the mountain, and your own cabin on the cruise ship, as I \r\nassumed the passage would take you back to the dock. It\'s easy to interpret\r\nthese areas as something that has no need to be interacted with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also the issue of a lack of gems. For the most part the enemies are\r\nare simple enough, but arbitrary landmines causing you to lose health or load a\r\nsave make it easy to need healing, and while the game provides several locations\r\nwhere you can purchase health and other supplies, it\'s possible to overspend and\r\nfind yourself unable to get on the cruise ship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My last issue with the game are the various bugs in the code. There aren\'t a\r\nton of these, but some like the checks to access Banana Island make it seem\r\nlikely the game had no proper playtesting before its release. The timer breaking\r\nwhen searching for gold to get on the cruise ship was arguably a blessing in\r\ndisguise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other amateurish decisions, like the mines and the weird set of\r\narbitrary items required to progress that never actually get used. The Lost\r\nMonkeys really feels like the sort of game a young child would made, and maybe\r\nthe excuse of youth is why I was able to brush these flaws aside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or maybe I\'m just enamored by the love put into the creation of the game\'s\r\nart and story boards. The vehicles have a lot of charm, and I found myself\r\nwondering what vehicle I\'d find at the end of each island to take me to the \r\nnext one. The Lost Monkeys has a lot of heart, and feels a bit like a Saturday\r\nmorning cartoon at times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lost Monkeys to me is a solid example of a ZZT game that I\'m certain\r\nwould not have ever existed if ZZT wasn\'t around. It\'s a grand adventure full of\r\nexplosions and spaceships, created by somebody likely too young to try their\r\nhand at making such a game with a more typical programming language. It\'s a game\r\nthat let its author tap into creativity and share it with the world that would\r\nhave otherwise been squandered and forgotten about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had fun with playing The Lost Monkeys, and I bet you will too if you give\r\nit a try.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of \r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-10-23',1,'django',3,183,'',''),(186,'Closer Look: CAT, CAT, THAT DAMN CAT','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get CAT, CAT, THAT DAMN CAT?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CAT, CAT, THAT DAMN CAT is available on\r\n<a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=catcat.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_CATCAT\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CAT, CAT, THAT DAMN CAT</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_329.png\'%}\" alt=\"329\">\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Commodore<br>\r\nReleased: Oct. 13, 2009\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>CAT, CAT, THAT DAMN CAT (which I am going to just call Cat, Cat going\r\nforward) recently turned 7-years old, and yet it\'s one of the most recently\r\nreleased ZZT games out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, (excluding my post-mortem on\r\n<a href=\"https://pokyfriends.com/blog/23/the-making-of-ruins-of-zzt\"\r\ntarget=\"_blank\">Ruins of ZZT</a>,) every world looked at has been from within\r\nthe first decade of ZZT\'s release. This time we\'ll be taking a look at a game\r\nthat comes from the bitter end. One that\'s so recent, that the front page of z2\r\nstill has a news post for its release. (Which also goes to show how dead z2 is\r\nthese days as well.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2009, ZZT was pretty much done for. The community was rapidly shrinking,\r\nnewly created worlds were a rarity, and those that would still come out, were\r\ngreeted with an empty audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you released a ZZT game in 2009, you\'d be lucky to get ten people to play\r\nit. At this point, creating something with ZZT was about the journey and not the\r\ndestination. There\'d be no praise, no awards, no feedback. Cat, Cat was made\r\nbecause Commodore wanted to make it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_330.png\'%}\" alt=\"330\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game\'s title screen was created using ZBitmap, using a photograph of\r\nCommodore\'s own cat. It winds up being one of the most visually striking title\r\nscreens I\'ve ever seen in ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_331.png\'%}\" alt=\"331\">\r\n\r\n<p>Starting the game gives a simple introduction, your owner is gone, and you\r\nneed to find food, or your owner. Cats don\'t particularly value one over the\r\nother.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_332.png\'%}\" alt=\"332\">\r\n\r\n<p>And with that, the standard gameplay begins. This late into the lifespan of\r\nZZT, there\'s a definite interest in creating things which haven\'t been done\r\nbefore. No longer focused on pushing the limits of ZZT to emulate watered-down\r\nmechanics and gameplay of modern games, but instead to create experiences that\r\nhave never been done before. Cat, Cat stands out as unique among ZZT games, and\r\nit becomes apparent why upon taking your first step.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_333.png\'%}\" alt=\"333\">\r\n\r\n<p>When the player moves left, the cat repositions themselves on the screen. At\r\nfirst glance, one might expect this board to be an opening cutscene, a static\r\npiece of artwork depicting a living room, when in reality it\'s the way the game\r\npresents itself to player. Several objects in the dark green area check where\r\nthe player is standing and draw the cat based on how the player stands. The game\r\nhandles graphics like an LCD game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_334.png\'%}\" alt=\"334\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_335.png\'%}\" alt=\"335\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player can freely walk into the passage and proceed to the next room\r\nwhere the engine comes into play again. This time, with vertical movement as a\r\npossibility allowing the cat to jump up onto the endtable.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_336.png\'%}\" alt=\"336\">\r\n\r\n<p>Though not explained explicitly, those familiar with ZZT\'s player clones will\r\nsee the two surrounded by breakable walls and know that shooting will cause some\r\naction to occur. This is the way that the cat can interact with the world around\r\nthem.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_337.png\'%}\" alt=\"337\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_338.png\'%}\" alt=\"338\">\r\n\r\n<p>Knocking over the vase causes a spilled vase to appear on the ground where\r\nthe player can collect a key.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_340.png\'%}\" alt=\"340\">\r\n\r\n<p>Some objects, are purely decorative. Standing by the photo or fruit bowl will\r\ngive you descriptions, but can\'t be interacted with. If you thought about eating\r\nthe fruit, you\'ll be disappointed to learn they\'re wax.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_342.png\'%}\" alt=\"342\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_343.png\'%}\" alt=\"343\">\r\n\r\n<p>The kitchen has the player climb tiny stairs to make the cat do the same. The\r\ngame\'s engine betrays that it will be possible to exit from that door at some\r\npoint due to the third passage visible in the player area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worth noting is the kitchen has wallpaper, and uses large appliances as a way\r\nto give a room a background without having the silhouette of the invisible cat\r\nsprites showing. Commodore is required to do a lot on creative design to bring\r\nlife into rooms which have to have large black spaces where the cat can\r\nappear.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_345.png\'%}\" alt=\"345\">\r\n\r\n<p>A horizontal row of red walls with three more for a tail manages to create an\r\nadorable scene of the cat hiding beneath the bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_346.png\'%}\" alt=\"346\">\r\n\r\n<p>Or the player can choose to nap on top of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_347.png\'%}\" alt=\"347\">\r\n\r\n<p>The bathroom door is locked, but can be opened with the key found in the\r\nvase.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_349.png\'%}\" alt=\"349\">\r\n\r\n<p>The bathroom has a leaking showerhead which constantly drips water as well as\r\na toilet which can of course be interacted with.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_350.png\'%}\" alt=\"350\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_351.png\'%}\" alt=\"351\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_352.png\'%}\" alt=\"352\">\r\n\r\n<p>With the new key, it\'s possible to open the backdoor to the house and venture\r\noutside.

The more damage\r\nWizcat takes, the more often he\'ll shoot magic back at you. Unfortunately it\'s a\r\nbit of a tedious fight since there\'s very little to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_446.png\'%}\" alt=\"446\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_447.png\'%}\" alt=\"447\">\r\n\r\n<p>And just when you might think it\'s over, there\'s a second fight immediately\r\nafter the first.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_448.png\'%}\" alt=\"448\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_449.png\'%}\" alt=\"449\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_452.png\'%}\" alt=\"452\">\r\n\r\n<p>The dragon fight plays out just like the fight against Wizcat. Except by now\r\nthe player is probably sick of the combat system, unique as it might be. The\r\ngraphical limitations imposed by having to draw out of invisibles looked\r\npassable for the cats, but the dragon comes off really crude looking. It\'s a bit\r\nof a low note for the game to end with this.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_454.png\'%}\" alt=\"454\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/cat-cat-that-damn-cat/zzt_455.png\'%}\" alt=\"455\">\r\n\r\n<p>And that\'s that for CAT, CAT, THAT DAMN CAT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game is really unique among other ZZT games thanks to its graphical\r\npresentation, which generally works really well. It looks and feels unlike any\r\nother ZZT game out there. Commodore did an excellent job working with the very\r\nrestrictive requirements for essentially creating an LCD game in ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had this game been a more traditional presentation with a player walking\r\naround rooms, I don\'t think the game would\'ve held up nearly as well. Commodore\r\nmanaged to put a fresh coat of paint on ZZT in 2009, which is really quite the\r\nfeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s short and the puzzles are all very simple, but it works for the\r\nwhimsical adventure Commodore wanted it to be. Had the game wound up being\r\nabout a spy, I don\'t think the engine would\'ve been able to support the more\r\ncomplex premise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only real complaint is the combat tacked on at the very end. Like the\r\nrest of the game, it\'s highly original, but while the engine works nicely for\r\nmoving from room to room and interacting with items, it stretches its abilities\r\na bit too far for combat, creating an action scene that starts to drag, followed\r\nby another fight which ends the game on a bit of a low note. The dragon fight\r\nalso feels oddly out of place. Perhaps if the combat had been split up with one\r\nfight on Earth and another in space the pacing would\'ve felt a bit better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its flaws in combat, overall CAT CAT, THAT DAMN CAT is a pleasure to\r\nplay, and can be beaten in less than half an hour. It\'s short, and even the most\r\nsimple cat graphics can be cute. Give it a shot!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do play it, and you also have a cat, you\'ll almost certainly want to\r\npet them after playing this. It\'s what I\'m going to do right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of \r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-10-29',1,'django',2,186,'',''),(188,'Closer Look: The Underground Bugtown of ZZT','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get The Underground Bugtown of ZZT?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Underground Bugtown of ZZT is available on\r\n<a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=bugtown.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_bugtown\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n<h2>The Underground Bugtown of ZZT</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Alexis Janson<br>\r\nPublished Under: Software Visions<br>\r\nReleased: 1993\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first game full of fuzzy data! z2 refers to the game as just Bugtown, but\r\nboth the game\'s title screen and documentation use the much longer title of The\r\nUnderground Bugtown of ZZT. Not only that, but the ZZT file\'s last modified date\r\nis from 1995, while the documentation says 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly every Software Visions release has the exact same 1995 modified date,\r\nso most likely somebody split up a collection and uploaded the games\r\nindividually at some point. It will quickly become apparent that this is almost\r\ncertainly an earlier release by Janson, who was known for her top quality games\r\nand lasting influence on ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real reason I decided to play Bugtown was that I had been playing a lot\r\nof the newly released Creepy Castle, a game with a predominately insect cast, so\r\nI was on a bug kick. As we\'ll see, it\'s a rough release, and very much inspired\r\nby Town of ZZT, and to a lesser extent the other registered worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n\r\n<p>From the very opening the influence of Town on Bugtown is apparent. Going\r\nover a few of the various elements that make up ZZT worlds. There\'s also some\r\ndetails on the objects that will be encountered. Bugs, humans, and cops.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_004.png\'%}\" alt=\"004\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_005.png\'%}\" alt=\"005\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game opens with the player on a train, a box of objects which carries\r\nthem to their destination on the other side of the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_003.png\'%}\" alt=\"003\">\r\n\r\n<p>Demonstrating the fragility of ZZT\'s objects, simply moving to the right\r\nrather than the left at the start of the game instead causes the train to break\r\nhorribly!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m rather curious as to why it breaks like this. The object\'s code is basic\r\nmovement instructions and the player shouldn\'t actually have any impact on how\r\nthe train moves. It\'s very bizarre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once past the gate, the player is unceremoniously locked in, forced to make\r\ntheir way towards the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_006.png\'%}\" alt=\"006\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_007.png\'%}\" alt=\"007\">\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few initial supplies handed out, making sure the player will be\r\nready to go once they make it to town, but otherwise the room is pretty\r\nsparse.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_009.png\'%}\" alt=\"009\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen is revealed to be a graveyard when the white keys are shown\r\nto instead be graves. Up ahead is our first insect friend to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_011.png\'%}\" alt=\"011\">\r\n\r\n<div><b>I came about the quest. What is it?</b></div>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_012.png\'%}\" alt=\"012\">\r\n\r\n<div><b>Where can I find them?</b></div>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_013.png\'%}\" alt=\"013\">\r\n\r\n<div><b>What do I do with them?</b></div>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_014.png\'%}\" alt=\"014\">\r\n\r\n<div><b>Where can I buy supplies?</b></div>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_015.png\'%}\" alt=\"015\">\r\n\r\n<div><b>Why shouldn\'t I touch the graves?</b></div>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_016.png\'%}\" alt=\"016\">\r\n\r\n<p>The insect is the game\'s info dump. The player now has a goal, getting the\r\nthree golden keys which will open the castle vault. There\'s a warning about the\r\ngraves, but the only one that does anything is that one by the gems. The rest\r\nare purely decorative.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_017.png\'%}\" alt=\"017\">\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to be a jerk you can get some more money out of them. Shooting a\r\nsecond time will cause the bug to chase you down and throw stars. Be nice to\r\nany bugs you meet.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_018.png\'%}\" alt=\"018\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_019.png\'%}\" alt=\"019\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_020.png\'%}\" alt=\"020\">\r\n\r\n<p>Disturbing the grave causes all the normal walls to be transformed into\r\ntigers! ZZT is limited to how many elements with stats can be on the board at\r\nonce so only the top few rows actually become tigers, the rest just\r\ndisappear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A side effect of this, is that since the board is now at its stat maximum,\r\nneither the player nor tigers can shoot bullets as there\'s no room in memory for\r\nZZT to spawn any. Thankfully this means the player can safely run to the exit\r\nwithout having to take any damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_022.png\'%}\" alt=\"022\">\r\n\r\n<p>Having fled from the tigers, the next screen is the hub of Bugtown.

As always, I\'m\r\napprehensive to spend any money.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_027.png\'%}\" alt=\"027\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_026.png\'%}\" alt=\"026\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a roadblock with a bunch of policemen preventing passage into the\r\ntown\'s jail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank is a dark room, and using a torch reveals it to be a combination\r\njust like the one in Town.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_029.png\'%}\" alt=\"029\">\r\n\r\n<p>The last building in the town is the hospital, where the receptionist will\r\ntell us we have to wait since we have no emergency.

If the player begs twice,\r\nthe guard will let them go. If they ask for death they will get a game over.\r\nTrying to bribe brings up a prompt asking for five, ten, or fifteen gems with\r\nten or more getting the player out. Ignoring him brings up the prompt again a\r\nfew seconds later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you tell him there\'s a giant worm behind his back he laughs at you.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_053.png\'%}\" alt=\"053\">\r\n\r\n<p>But then a hidden object actually spawns a giant worm! Unfortunately, the\r\nguard has no reaction to it ever, but it\'s a cute joke.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"054\">\r\n\r\n<p>Once the player is free, they can head to the town park, which is full of\r\ncreatures to fight. There\'s enough forest on the screen that it\'s much easier\r\nand safer to just ignore the enemies and tunnel through the forest instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_055.png\'%}\" alt=\"055\">\r\n\r\n<p>Heading west from here brings the player back around to the eastern side of\r\ntown. ZZT\'s boards don\'t have to form a map that perfectly fits together. It\r\nwould be just as possible to make going back east from here take the player to\r\nan entirely different board.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_056.png\'%}\" alt=\"056\">\r\n\r\n<p>Going deeper into the forest leads to this screen which is reminiscent of the\r\nforest section in Town of ZZT where the player has to make it past enemies that\r\nare constantly being duplicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s pretty standard stuff, but I\'m unsure what the purpose of the\r\nduplicating boulders is. They could theoretically trap the player, but by the\r\ntime the player reaches them, they\'d be right be the way out that doesn\'t\r\ninvolve backtracking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the boulders are extremely dangerous as if ZZT tries to duplicate a\r\nboulder but there\'s a player in the way ZZT has a runtime error and kicks you\r\nright back to the DOS prompt. The player needs to quickly go through the\r\ntransporter in this segment lest they lose their progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_059.png\'%}\" alt=\"059\">\r\n\r\n<p>The cave itself is a few dark rooms, but fortunately not a huge maze or\r\nanything. Pictured above is the last screen of the cave with the darkness turned\r\noff. It\'s mostly just shooting a few creatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_060.png\'%}\" alt=\"060\">\r\n\r\n<p>What is neat about the cave, is that the walls regularly flash different\r\ncolors. There\'s no design reason this needs to be happen, but this one piece of\r\nmoss serves as an explanation for why it happens in game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_062.png\'%}\" alt=\"062\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also the the first golden yellow key at the other end of the same\r\nscreen. These get turned in at the castle, but I\'ll get to that later.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_065.png\'%}\" alt=\"065\">\r\n\r\n<p>Next, I headed east of the park to this board with a lake. It doesn\'t look\r\nlike much, but I spent a lot of time here. The board would appear to just be\r\nfull of spinning guns which shoot out bullets randomly, but there\'s a clear path\r\naround the lake, so surely there must be some sort of secret.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_067.png\'%}\" alt=\"067\">\r\n\r\n<p>But there isn\'t. There\'s not a single object on this board. It\'s just the\r\nplayer and the guns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Except even worse, the board hasn\'t been linked properly! As touched on a bit\r\nearlier, in ZZT board exits have to be set each way, so the park connects to the\r\nlake, but the lake doesn\'t connect to the park or anything else. If you enter\r\nthis screen, you are forced to quit the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I saved on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_069.png\'%}\" alt=\"069\">\r\n\r\n<p>To avoid having to replay the game from the beginning I had to take my save,\r\nrename it to have a .ZZT extension, enable ZZT\'s debug mode so it would let me\r\nedit the save, link the boards myself, and then start playing the new ZZT world\r\nthat was formerly a save file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a process.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_071.png\'%}\" alt=\"071\">\r\n\r\n<p>I swung by the castle figuring I could drop off my key now, but still found\r\nmyself running into a spot where I\'d be unable to proceed and unable to escape.\r\nThis was more than slightly confusing.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_073.png\'%}\" alt=\"073\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_074.png\'%}\" alt=\"074\">\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, I went back to the bug town hub and headed north this time.

Objects will move\r\nthe player from room to room until they arrive at their destination. And just\r\nlike in City of ZZT, any novelty of the game moving the player by pushing them\r\nis swiftly eradicated by the tedium of having to wait for the elevator to reach\r\nthe room the player is currently in.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_093.png\'%}\" alt=\"093\">\r\n\r\n<p>This bug friend informs the player that they\'ll need to find a way into the\r\nboss\'s office (hey, that rhymes).

It\'s also\r\nthe sort of thing that 100% would not work outside of ZZT\'s text environment. In\r\nZZT there\'s nothing unusual about a green plant looking identical to a bomb. A\r\nplant that turns out is actually a bomb would stand out a little bit in a modern\r\nAAA title.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_106.png\'%}\" alt=\"106\">\r\n\r\n<p>So there\'s the second golden key.

It\'s a triumph for thoughtful design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course, wouldn\'t you know it, the reward is the third and final key\r\nand I\'m still here holding the first one, unsure how to get rid of it!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_130.png\'%}\" alt=\"130\">\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say, this board gave me a lot of trouble. At first I thought the\r\nboard might have been accidentally unbeatable. It seemed I could never make any\r\nprogress due to missing a green key. I originally wound up cheating my way\r\nthrough, only to realize my mistake when I began writing this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/bugtown/bugtown_042.png\'%}\" alt=\"042\">\r\n\r\n<p>Remember how there were two green keys back here? I didn\'t. You\'re supposed\r\nto use the second green key on this board to be able to complete it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That made the puzzle seem solvable, but it then appeared that it was\r\nimpossible to make it back out of the room once inside due to the red slider to\r\nthe left of the white music note object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually I figured out that this was also a mistake on my part and the room\r\nis 100% beatable and 100% of an understatement for its name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly trying to break it down via screenshots would be a nightmare. I just\r\nmade a video of the solution instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjSa8JzkAWU\"\r\nframeborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>There are numerous points where doing things out of order can make it\r\nimpossible to clear.

After that slightly confusing puzzle, I\'m thankful for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, The Underground Bugtown of ZZT by Alexis Janson. Bugtown is... a mess? \r\nThere were certainly less playable games out there by this point in ZZT\'s\r\nhistory, and Janson would go on to become one of the most well respected ZZTers\r\nwhose games were inspirational, and whose contributions with things like Super\r\nTool Kit were revolutionary for the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bugtown however is clearly from Janson\'s earlier days. It still follows the\r\ntemplate introduced in the official ZZT worlds quite heavily, but doesn\'t really\r\nbring anything new to them. If you\'ve played Sweeney\'s ZZT games, you\'re not\r\nlikely to be impressed by anything in Bugtown. Janson hasn\'t really found her\r\nvoice yet in Bugtown, and gives us what today feels like a mediocre knockoff of\r\nTown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are still a few glimmers of what Janson could do hinted at throughout\r\nBugtown. Improving Sweeney\'s bank puzzle to allow for multiple attempts was a\r\nwelcome change and genuinely surprised me. The scene with the mayor and being\r\ndragged off to jail is a good early example of complex interactions between\r\nobjects, and with a bit of humor added to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, I\'d have a tough time recommending somebody plays Bugtown just for\r\nthe sake of playing Bugtown. Playing it and seeing how it compared to later\r\nJanson games might make it more interesting to see how Janson\'s work refined\r\nover time compared to the much more crude Bugtown. Games like Code Red and \r\nMission Enigma were gamechangers for ZZT, but Bugtown is just a buggier version\r\nof Town.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of \r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-11-13',1,'django',2,188,'',''),(190,'Closer Look: Smiley Guy','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get Smiley Guy?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Smiley Guy is available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=zzttoxic.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_zzttoxic\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>.\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also explore the world yourself on the \r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/s/zzttoxic.zip?file=SMILEY.ZZT&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT Public Beta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n<h2>Smiley Guy</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Al Payne<br>\r\n<!--Published Under: <br>-->\r\nReleased: Nov. 1991\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Smiley Guy is one of ZZT\'s earliest games.

Nearly every board in the game will have an\r\neasily accessible \"H\" which the player can use to get advice on what they should\r\nbe doing or in some cases offering outright solutions to puzzles which makes the\r\ngame very accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT\'s sequel Super ZZT went as far as adding a built in hint system where the\r\n\"H\" key would make every object jump to a :hint label if they had one, but in\r\nvanilla ZZT this is the best that can be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_005.png\'%}\" alt=\"005\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game begins proper in Bog Woods, where swamp flies are slowly duplicated\r\nonto the board while the player has to navigate winding paths which give them\r\ntime to spawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bugs aren\'t much of a threat, moving slowly and being defeated with a\r\nsingle shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_006.png\'%}\" alt=\"006\">\r\n\r\n<p>The hint objects offer a lot of information, just looking at the questions\r\nis enough to let the player know that there\'s more to this board than what is\r\nclearly visible.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_004.png\'%}\" alt=\"004\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_007.png\'%}\" alt=\"007\">\r\n\r\n<p>The first order of business is to head to Bog\'s cabin, to try and help out\r\nSmiley\'s friend Bog who seems to be in trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a red key behind a transporter which appears to trap the player\r\ninside, but of course one of the walls is fake allowing for a safe exit. In my\r\nown playthrough one of the centipedes went through the fake wall before I even\r\nwent through the transporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hint object will offer advice if you\'re stuck in the key area, except if\r\nyou\'re stuck in the key area you can\'t interact with the hint object unless you\r\nquit and reloaded the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_008.png\'%}\" alt=\"008\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_009.png\'%}\" alt=\"009\">\r\n\r\n<p>Bog explains to the player that Dr. Z is up to no good and planning to\r\ndestroy the environment and conquer the world. The game doesn\'t really go into\r\ndepth with its environmentalism, but the plot has pro-environmental touches\r\nthat you\'d see out of an episode of Captain Planet or a Sonic the Hedgehog game\r\nof the era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bog also offers Smiley some pepper? It seems kinda weird, but will all make\r\nsense in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_015.png\'%}\" alt=\"015\">\r\n\r\n<p>Back outside, I checked out the woods more thoroughly in search of bonus\r\npoints and gems. You can find some hikers that are lost and get bonus points,\r\nand most of the dead ends have gems if you search the area nearby. This means\r\nmore flies, but the player can opt to just shoot through the breakable walls of\r\nthe woods to get around them rather than risking a confrontation.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_016.png\'%}\" alt=\"016\">\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of environmentalism, Dr. Z revels in toxic waste and barrels like\r\nthis one are often found throughout the game when there\'s danger nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_017.png\'%}\" alt=\"017\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_018.png\'%}\" alt=\"018\">\r\n\r\n<p>Smiley Guy wastes no time and get right to it, just north of Bog\'s woods are\r\nthe living labs of Dr. Z, and with the key from Bog\'s cabin, Smiley Guy can\r\nenter the grounds where he immediately has to fight a giant spider to gain the\r\nkey to the labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_020.png\'%}\" alt=\"020\">\r\n\r\n<p>The livings labs are arranged like some not quite human monstrosity. The\r\nentrance is via the jaws, and the player is given two paths they may take. But\r\nfirst, there\'s somebody else in here with the player.</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}\r\nSmiley finds a postman groggy from the\r\noutflow of toxic fumes.  He sees a \r\npostcard on the floor next to the mail \r\nbag.  It\'s a card Smiley just mailed.\r\n\r\nIt reads:\r\n\r\n\"Yo Rambo,\r\n\r\nGet a free Smiley Guy momento.  Make\r\na return envelope.  Be sure it is\r\nstamped, self-addressed, and letter\r\nsize or larger.\r\n\r\nSend it to:\r\n    Smiley Guy\r\n    c/o  Al Payne\r\n    Route 2  Box 30\r\n    Danville, IA 52623\r\n\r\n                    - Smiley\"\r\n\r\nSmiley hands back the card and returns\r\nhis attention to the lab.\r\n\r\nThe postman looks up with admiration \r\nand says, \"What a guy!\"\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>Well, there\'s not much there. To proceed, the player has to carefully move\r\naround the many teeth in the jaws, making sure not to touch any or else they\'ll\r\nlose health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving through this board is very slow and it\'s very easy to mistime a step\r\nand lose 10 health for it. It makes for a very ungenerous opening to the game,\r\nand worst of all at some point the player will have to navigate the jaws a\r\nsecond time later.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_024.png\'%}\" alt=\"024\">\r\n\r\n<p>I opted to take the southern route through the passage, into the heart of \r\nthe labs. Both chambers are one way trips due to transporters and both are full\r\nof white cells ready to destroy any intruders in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of buttons and some arrows in the left chamber are used to work a\r\npuzzle on the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_029.png\'%}\" alt=\"029\">\r\n\r\n<p>Pressing a button causes the corresponding arrows in the blue chamber to move\r\nin the direction they\'re pointing if they can. The player has to create a path\r\nthat will let them access the green key later. The hints will offer an exact\r\nsolution to the puzzle, but since it\'s past the transporter, the player will\r\nhave a lot of backtracking to do before they can attempt the puzzle again.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_031.png\'%}\" alt=\"031\">\r\n\r\n<p>South of the heart, are the intestines. Don\'t use this game to learn anatomy.\r\nThe intestines are a maze that spans two boards. There\'s no real danger, just\r\ntedium, so I can\'t say I\'m fond of this segment, although it works\r\nthematically.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_032.png\'%}\" alt=\"032\">\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the intestines is this closed off room. Dr. Z has plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_033.png\'%}\" alt=\"033\">\r\n\r\n<p>Our hero finds and struggles to inflate a balloon.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_034.png\'%}\" alt=\"034\">\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the intestines are more of the same, but offer two more exits to\r\nexplore in addition to the still untaken path to the right heart chamber.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_036.png\'%}\" alt=\"036\">\r\n\r\n<p>Good. Great.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_037.png\'%}\" alt=\"037\">\r\n\r\n<p>The other intestines connect to a leg. They start with the thigh.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_038.png\'%}\" alt=\"038\">\r\n\r\n<p>Down onto the knee.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_040.png\'%}\" alt=\"040\">\r\n\r\n<p>Through the calf. All these boards are normally dark, so the message about\r\nthe game and its development period are normally invisible to the player. This\r\nEaster egg gives a firm date for the game at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_041.png\'%}\" alt=\"041\">\r\n\r\n<p>And finally down to the foot where the player just needs to dodge the blink\r\nwalls and pick up a cyan key for their troubles.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_044.png\'%}\" alt=\"044\">\r\n\r\n<p>Going north from the second lower plumbing board connects to the toxic\r\nstomach. The stomach is lined with worms that feed on the toxic waste that the\r\nlabs consume. There\'s also a blue key and some bonus points up for grabs.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_046.png\'%}\" alt=\"046\">\r\n\r\n<p>Or perhaps not. Getting the bonus points causes the worms to spring to action\r\nand rush the player, quickly trapping them and draining their life away.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_047.png\'%}\" alt=\"047\">\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately some friendly hints are here to help. There\'s a J-shaped King\r\nWorm just outside the stomach gorging himself with a direct line to the toxic\r\nwaste.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_050.png\'%}\" alt=\"050\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_049.png\'%}\" alt=\"049\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_052.png\'%}\" alt=\"052\">\r\n\r\n<p>Simply shoot at the barrel of toxic waste to destroy the food supply, and the\r\nworms all die off allowing the player to get the key at their leisure.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"054\">\r\n\r\n<p>West of the stomach is the deep throat maze. There are four identical rooms\r\nhere which connect to each other and various other areas of the living labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_055.png\'%}\" alt=\"055\">\r\n\r\n<p>One board has a second cyan key which I was forced to ignore as I already had\r\none.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_056.png\'%}\" alt=\"056\">\r\n\r\n<p>Sure enough, the deep throat\'s connected to the jaws. The mucus is thankfully\r\nplaced in a way that the play can still shoot from it from this side. ZZT\'s\r\nbuilt in creatures like lions and ruffians can be shot when the player stands\r\nnext to them, but objects cannot.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_057.png\'%}\" alt=\"057\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_058.png\'%}\" alt=\"058\">\r\n\r\n<p>The brain cells give Smiley Guy his ultimate goal, picking up the five keys\r\nto get to Dr. Z. Oddly though it\'s not that Dr. Z is hiding, but that Bog has\r\nhim trapped inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_060.png\'%}\" alt=\"060\">\r\n\r\n<p>This time heading east from the jaws to the neck. There\'s a green object that\r\nrepeatedly bounces up and down against one of the toxic waste pipelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_061.png\'%}\" alt=\"061\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_062.png\'%}\" alt=\"062\">\r\n\r\n<p>The object is revealed to be a bouncing booger. Yuck. Bouncer offers some\r\nadvice on how to get to Dr. Z and offers help if the player can build a sneeze\r\nbomb allowing it to escape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The balloon that was found in the closed off corridor is the first step\r\ntowards making the bomb.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_063.png\'%}\" alt=\"063\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_064.png\'%}\" alt=\"064\">\r\n\r\n<p>East of the neck, is of course, the supply store. It\'s a bit sparse, and\r\nthe cost for health is a bit much when you realize it takes 10 gems to heal as\r\nmuch health as the player loses from a single hit, but for once it seems like\r\nthere\'s no reason to save any gems for some game mandatory purchase that the\r\nplayer doesn\'t know about.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_065.png\'%}\" alt=\"065\">\r\n\r\n<p>Ha. ha. ha. I\'m only kidding. Every store in ZZT is out for blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_067.png\'%}\" alt=\"067\">\r\n\r\n<p>The neck is also connected to the deep throat, and I navigated the maze back\r\nto the intestines to finally pick up this green key in the heart. It was also a\r\ngood time to traverse the jaws for a second time to head back outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_069.png\'%}\" alt=\"069\">\r\n\r\n<p>The cyan key is traded for a purple one, which allows the player to pick up\r\nthe other cyan key in the deep throat. Going back in means navigating the jaws\r\nfor a third time.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_070.png\'%}\" alt=\"070\">\r\n\r\n<p>Still another exit from the deep throat maze is the lung, which contains what\r\nI thought was some sort of rocket?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_072.png\'%}\" alt=\"072\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_074.png\'%}\" alt=\"074\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_077.png\'%}\" alt=\"077\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_079.png\'%}\" alt=\"079\">\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, it\'s a rather large air pump, which can be used to inflate the\r\nballoon found earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/smiley-guy/zzt_081.png\'%}\" alt=\"081\">\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the sneeze bomb can\'t be complete with just a balloon.

Another title, \"Mystery Science \r\nZZTheater 3000\", from an unknown author took the approach of making a game with a\r\nstory similar to one you\'d see in a bad movie and having the team riff on this \r\nmade up movie/game. The last two are made by acclaimed ZZTer John W. Wells, and\r\nare in fact proper riffs of ZZT games created by others. ZZT\'s readily edited\r\nworlds make such a thing very simple to do, and I\'m a bit surprised nobody other\r\nthan Wells ever tried such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But today, LaChapelle\'s is the one being examined, and I\'ll get it out of the\r\nway here: It\'s not a good game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n\r\n<p>The title screen gets right to it. Here\'s the title, here\'s who made it, and\r\nhere are the main characters.</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}\r\n@Prologue\r\n\"Another week, another movie\" you think as\r\nyou walk out the theater again. After five\r\nyears of watching the worst movies ever\r\nmade, you think you\'ve seen everything\r\nthere is between giant fire-breating\r\nturtles and silly string ninjas. So you\r\ndon\'t think about looking behind you\r\ntoward that wierd noise before the doors\r\nclose behind you...\r\nCrow: Boy, Joel, how much longer do we\r\nhave to do this before we get down to\r\nEarth?\r\nJoel: I\'m not sure. I\'m pretty sure the\r\nMads have a whole truckload of movies at\r\nDeep 13 just waiting to be shown.\r\nTom: Yeah. I\'m guessing between 3-5 more\r\nyears before they get through with them.\r\nJoel: Just don\'t think too much about it,\r\nguys. We\'ll be back to earth soon. Trust\r\nme!\r\nSuddenly, the monitor next to Cambot\r\nflashes on.\r\n&gt;Blink!&lt;\r\nDr. Forrester: Hello, booby! I see you got\r\nthrough another one. I have a little\r\nsuprise for you and your little friends.\r\nJoel: Really? What is it?\r\nDr.: I\'ve....well....tell them, Frank.\r\nFrank: What the doctor is trying to say is\r\n.....that....\r\nJoel and the bots: WHAT???\r\nDr.: We\'ve...run out of movies.\r\nJoel: Alright!! That means we finally go\r\nback down to earth, right?\r\nDr.: Are you kidding? I\'m still in the\r\nmiddle of my experiment. And so are you!\r\nCrow: What? Are you crazy?\r\nDr.: That\'s right! You\'re not leaving that\r\nsattelte for another 3-5 years! And to\r\nmake sure of that....\r\nBefore he finishes his sentence, the doors\r\nbehind you open up and a horde of\r\ncreatures walk into the room!\r\nJoel: What\'s going on here!?\r\nDr.: It\'s a result of my latest invention,\r\nthe Patented 3-D Projection Screen!\r\nFrank: Or P3DPC!\r\nDr.: Yeah....huh? Anyway, what it does is\r\ntakes anything that is alive on the screen\r\nand makes is come alive in real life!\r\nFrank: In other words, all you see there\r\nhas jumped out of the screen and into your\r\npod!\r\nDr.: Yes, and they\'ve all been programed\r\nto do one thing: Keep you and your robots\r\nfrom leaving the Sattelite of Love!\r\nThen four of the creatures grab your\r\nrobots and take them to different parts of\r\nthe ship!\r\nThe Bots: HEEEEEEEEEEEEELP!!!!\r\nJoel: Hey, you can\'t do that!\r\nFrank: Oh, can\'t we? We\'re evil! EVIL!!\r\nDr.: So long Joeline! HA HA HA HA HA HA!!\r\nJoel: Great! Now what am I supposed to do?\r\nMagic Voice: I suggest you save them.\r\nJoel: But how?\r\nM.V.: You can use your Tickle Bazooka to\r\nmake the monsters die laughing.\r\nJoel: Good idea! And?\r\nM.V.: And I just happen to know where the\r\nrobots are.\r\nJoel: Can you show me?\r\nM.V.: Of course! And one more thing...This\r\nwas supposed to be a suprise from Gypsy,\r\nbut since this is an emergency, I\'ll tell\r\nyou. She\'s been secretly building a\r\nshuttle that will take you and the robots\r\nback to Earth. She had handed a key to the\r\nfour doors leading the shuttle to each of\r\nthe robots. But before she was able to\r\nshow you, this had to happen.\r\nJoel: Boy, Gypsy never seems to let me\r\ndown.\r\nM.V.: If you can save your robots you will\r\nbe able to get back home...\r\nJoel: And I can get revenge on the Mads!\r\nThanks, Magic Voice! Okay, Mads......\r\nIT\'S SHOWTIME!\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_003.png\'%}\" alt=\"003\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game opens right away with a wall of text to explain the plot. Despite\r\nrunning out of movies to show, you have to stay behind on the Satellite and now\r\ndeal with characters from these terrible films being a part of reality. The bots\r\nhave been kidnapped and you\'ll need to rescue them to get the necessary keys to\r\nescape back to Earth. It\'s your typical Town of ZZT get the keys in whatever\r\norder you like quest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game is full of references to the various movies shown in MST3K and that\r\nincludes giving new names to all the default enemies you\'ll encounter. This game\r\nis dated as being from 1996 but looks and plays like something out of 1993, so\r\nstandard enemies are in, and objects are pretty simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_004.png\'%}\" alt=\"004\">\r\n\r\n<p>Grabbing the ammo, I headed north to go after Tom Servo first. There\'s some\r\ncute little ascii art made with the text tool to depict Tom. At first I thought\r\nthat red key was supposed to be him, what with the similar body shapes and all,\r\nbut it was merely a red key to open one of the doors in the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_006.png\'%}\" alt=\"006\">\r\n\r\n<p>What MST3K the ZZT game loves to do is ask you MST3K trivia questions. I\'ve\r\nseen a reasonable number of them over the years, and would consider myself a fan\r\nif not a particularly knowledgeable one, so in my case there\'s a lot of guessing\r\non trivia.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_007.png\'%}\" alt=\"007\">\r\n\r\n<p>I correctly guessed butter on my first try, since it was the funniest of the\r\nthree options. With Toga Man out of the way, the player can proceed into the\r\nnext room.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_008.png\'%}\" alt=\"008\">\r\n\r\n<p>So this is about what to expect from MST3K. A series of chambers of stock\r\nenemies and a key at the end that will let you open the next door in a character\r\nhub room. This particular board offers two paths, with the bottom one lacking in\r\nlions, or Mr. B-Naturals as the game called them.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_011.png\'%}\" alt=\"011\">\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, instead of lions, the player has to deal with an invisible wall\r\nmaze instead, which may be even worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_014.png\'%}\" alt=\"014\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next sections consist of centipedes and more invisible walls, as well as\r\nthe world\'s most common boulder puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_015.png\'%}\" alt=\"015\">\r\n\r\n<p>The reward for making it through is 100 health and a blue key. There\'s also\r\na secret path to the double exclamation point object if the player is willing to\r\nlook around for it and collect 5000 points for their trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_022.png\'%}\" alt=\"022\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_023.png\'%}\" alt=\"023\">\r\n\r\n<p>With the blue key it\'s possible to head towards the next section of the Tom\r\nhub and another trivia question. Jerry (spelled Gerry on the actual show) was\r\nnot a movie character and thus the author made sure to explain how he got there\r\nlest people raise questions about continuity!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_025.png\'%}\" alt=\"025\">\r\n\r\n<p>The 2nd challenge to find Tom is to run past some blink walls. They\'re timed\r\nin such a way that the player can\'t just hold the up key and blast right through\r\nthem without taking damage so some pacing is necessary. This challenge gives a\r\nyellow key for the 3rd challenge, and makes the player backtrack to it again\r\nlater when they have the cyan key.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_028.png\'%}\" alt=\"028\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_029.png\'%}\" alt=\"029\">\r\n\r\n<p>Trivia! Again I go with the silliest answer of a hang glider and am rewarded\r\nfor it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_030.png\'%}\" alt=\"030\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_032.png\'%}\" alt=\"032\">\r\n\r\n<p>Town\'s influence knows no bounds and the same style of slider puzzle appears\r\nin MST3K as well. The player has to push some horizontal sliders in order to\r\nmake complete lines of boulders allowing the pushers to move south and clear a\r\npath to the cyan key. In Town the space for the puzzle is smaller, which makes\r\nit possible to accidentally push some sliders too far and fail the puzzle, but\r\nhere there\'s so much room that it would be extremely difficult to not be able to\r\nsolve the puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_033.png\'%}\" alt=\"033\">\r\n\r\n<p>After obtaining the key and backtracking to the 2nd challenge, it\'s time to \r\nrescue Tom Servo from Gamera.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_030.png\'%}\" alt=\"035\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_030.png\'%}\" alt=\"036\">\r\n\r\n<p>Gamera is about as simple as a boss object in ZZT can be. He doesn\'t move,\r\njust slowly shoots towards the player which means sometimes shooting to the sides\r\nwhen the player isn\'t aligned with him. It\'s very easy to just spam bullets in\r\nhis direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_039.png\'%}\" alt=\"039\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_040.png\'%}\" alt=\"040\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_041.png\'%}\" alt=\"041\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_042.png\'%}\" alt=\"042\">\r\n\r\n<p>My guessing at trivia questions fails me, but there\'s no penalty for an\r\nincorrect answer. Rescuing Tom Servo gives the player the first of the four keys\r\nthey\'ll need to escape to Earth. With one path cleared, it\'s time to turn in\r\nthe key and choose another.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_044.png\'%}\" alt=\"044\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_045.png\'%}\" alt=\"045\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_046.png\'%}\" alt=\"046\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_047.png\'%}\" alt=\"047\">\r\n\r\n<p>For my second bot I went with Gypsy. This time the path doesn\'t branch off as\r\nit did with Tom Servo\'s route. Once again the player is treated to some ascii\r\nart as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at my health when failing at trivia questions yet again, you\'ll\r\nsee that this time there actually was a 10 health penalty for a wrong answer!\r\nI\'d say the stakes were higher if not for the fact that these can be done in any\r\norder, so more likely the author just forgot to hurt the player on Tom\'s\r\npath.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_048.png\'%}\" alt=\"048\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_050.png\'%}\" alt=\"050\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_051.png\'%}\" alt=\"051\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next board consists of dodging some spinning guns and safely making your\r\nway down to the next trivia question. There are also some secret supplies, this\r\ntime well worth the effort as it\'s easily discovered by examining the walls and\r\nmeans another 100 health.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_053.png\'%}\" alt=\"053\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next screen is a big empty room filled with bears and...</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_055.png\'%}\" alt=\"055\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_058.png\'%}\" alt=\"058\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_050.png\'%}\" alt=\"059\">\r\n\r\n<p>An absolutely massive invisible maze! It was as fun as it looked.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_060.png\'%}\" alt=\"060\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_061.png\'%}\" alt=\"061\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_062.png\'%}\" alt=\"062\">\r\n\r\n<p>The writing on these characters gets to the trivia so quickly that whether\r\nyou\'re familiar with them or not, they have no real personality and the fact\r\nthat they\'re from specific movies winds up being meaningless.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_063.png\'%}\" alt=\"063\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next room is a long winding path with tigers to shoot. So I shoot\r\nthem. At least the game was nice enough to provide a bunch of ammo from a single\r\nobject.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_067.png\'%}\" alt=\"067\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_069.png\'%}\" alt=\"069\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_070.png\'%}\" alt=\"070\">\r\n\r\n<p>The second boss is Daddy-O, who moves continually up and down while shooting\r\na sine wave of bullets. Again the boss is trivial to defeat, and if you\'re so\r\ninclined, it\'s possible to just run into the gap and get to Gypsy without even\r\nfighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_071.png\'%}\" alt=\"071\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_072.png\'%}\" alt=\"072\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_073.png\'%}\" alt=\"073\">\r\n\r\n<p>Gypsy has an interesting choice for a security question, but it gets us our\r\nsecond key.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_075.png\'%}\" alt=\"075\">\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, Cambot.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_077.png\'%}\" alt=\"077\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_078.png\'%}\" alt=\"078\">\r\n\r\n<p>At this point I\'m becoming numb to the trivia.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_079.png\'%}\" alt=\"079\">\r\n\r\n<p>Another action sequence follows, this one full of transporters that warp the\r\nplayer from area to area. The first section contains some red objects that shoot\r\nendlessly and have to be dodged as they cannot be harmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_082.png\'%}\" alt=\"082\">\r\n\r\n<p>Next, some blinkwalls and a simple puzzle using boulders to block the\r\nspinning guns from shooting. Then just some lions and bears. Once again there\'s\r\nalso hidden bonus points, but they\'re not particularly exciting to obtain.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_092.png\'%}\" alt=\"092\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_093.png\'%}\" alt=\"093\">\r\n\r\n<p>After answering the latest trivia question, the player can proceed\r\nonward.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_094.png\'%}\" alt=\"094\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_095.png\'%}\" alt=\"095\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_098.png\'%}\" alt=\"098\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next board actually stands out a bit. It\'s still a very simple puzzle,\r\nbut at least it\'s not an invisible maze or another fifty tigers. At the end is\r\nstill more trivia.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_100.png\'%}\" alt=\"100\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_102.png\'%}\" alt=\"102\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_101.png\'%}\" alt=\"101\">\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of something new, this next board introduces darkness! Exiting the\r\nroom involves shooting a switch a few times that can be seen in the lit version\r\nof the room. A sound plays when you hit it, so despite it never being visible in\r\ntorch light, the player can still find it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s almost a fun puzzle, trying to find this hidden object, but it falls\r\nshort since ZZT sharks can\'t be killed, and they like to move towards the\r\nplayer. Most of your shots will be blocked and trying to find the object in the\r\ndark is a pain since you\'ll be hitting sharks and not realizing it. To get\r\nthrough, you\'ll need to lure the sharks away and then run to where the switch is\r\nand shoot at it then.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_103.png\'%}\" alt=\"103\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_104.png\'%}\" alt=\"104\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_106.png\'%}\" alt=\"106\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_109.png\'%}\" alt=\"109\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_110.png\'%}\" alt=\"110\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next room is the screening room! Featuring a row of seats, and Rommel\r\nfrom the currently being screened Sidehackers and a friend of his. They try to\r\nmove in a rectangular shape, but once they\'ve been shot their code desyncs and\r\nthey\'ll hit a wall and just stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For rescuing Cambot, the player receives the next green key. Just one more to\r\ngo with Crow.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_112.png\'%}\" alt=\"112\">\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, is Crow\'s path.

By having\r\nthree bodies of water, progress can be made fast enough that the board becomes\r\na fun challenge rather than here where it takes forever to get anywhere. Of\r\ncourse, unlike Town\'s board, this one doesn\'t return you to the entrance when\r\nyou get hit, which makes things a bit more bearable than what it could have\r\nbeen.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_181.png\'%}\" alt=\"181\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_185.png\'%}\" alt=\"185\">\r\n\r\n<p>Now this board is one which I actually like!

The centipedes will\r\nmove back and forth along the corridors and the player has to slowly warp their\r\nway across the board. Since the centipedes have no room to turn around they\'re\r\nforced in one direction until they hit the end of a corridor. This makes it\r\ntrivial to get through without getting hit as the player can just wait until the\r\ncentipede is a safe distance from the exit transporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/mst3k/zzt_190.png\'%}\" alt=\"190\">\r\n\r\n<p>Town of ZZT has a pretty famous board called \"The Three Lakes\" which-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait a minute.

This fight plays out the\r\nsame as before. Gamera, friend of all children, continues to stand still and\r\nshoot bullets.

Adam LaChapelle has no other known credited ZZT games.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MST3K for ZZT is simply bad. There\'s something ironic about a game whose\r\nsource material is a show that lampoons poorly made movies being turned into a\r\npoorly made game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While most of the games I\'ve written about have had some merits, MST3K really\r\nbrings nothing to the player. It exists as a small window into the mind of a fan\r\nof the show, and doesn\'t reveal anything to captivate one\'s interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has a bug rendering the game impossible to complete without editing, the\r\npuzzles are trivial, the trivia serves no purpose, and its combat is just piles\r\nof lions and tigers with no real thought to the environment placed around\r\nthem. Then you get multiple mazes to add to the tedium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I find it difficult to come up with positive things to say, unlike Bug Town\r\nwhere the game was crude and felt pretty lacking, Janson went on to keep honing\r\nher craft, LaChapelle released this and nothing else. I enjoyed the boulder\r\npuzzle room, and the ascii art of the bots stands out, but playing this game\r\nis just unfun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At points you\'d almost thing it was trying to be bad in the spirit of the\r\nfilms watched on the show, but it doesn\'t seem self-aware enough to really be\r\ngoing for such a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you happen to try this one for yourself, you probably won\'t get much out\r\nof it. If you\'ve never seen any MST3K the game won\'t make any sense to you, and\r\nif you have, you won\'t really get anything out of having that knowledge other\r\nthan better odds on trivia questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I should really just relax.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of \r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-11-27',1,'django',2,192,'',''),(194,'Closer Look: Turmoil','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get Turmoil?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Turmoil is available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=turmoil.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_turmoil\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>.\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also explore the world yourself on the \r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/t/turmoil.zip?file=TURMOIL.ZZT&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT Public Beta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/turmoil/zzt_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n<h2>Turmoil</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Clysm<br>\r\n<!--Published Under: <br>-->\r\nReleased: Jun. 24, 1996\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>During my recent stream of \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Simpsons 2\", one of the\r\nviewers made a comment that they were glad to see some \"average\" ZZT games, and\r\nnot just focusing on the best games out there. This comment surprised me since\r\nI think excluding the previously looked at MST3K game, the worlds I\'ve been\r\nwriting about and streaming have mostly been average or slightly above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t want to be assigning review scores or anything, but I do think that\r\nif I had to put ZZT worlds played for this project into a box labeled \"awful\", \r\n\"subpar\", \"average\", \"good\", or \"great\", that it would be a pretty easy task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The Simpsons\" would be bottom of the barrel, \"MST3K\" would be subpar, \r\n\"Merbotia\" would be average, \"King\'s Quest\" would be good, and so far I don\'t\r\nthink I\'ve covered anything truly exemplary. Maybe Toucan\'s \"Pop\". Actually\r\nprobably \"Pop\". It\'s almost like trying to boil a game down to a number is not\r\na good use of my time. Heck I\'m already thinking \"Wait maybe Merbotia should be\r\ngood and King\'s Quest great?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, putting aside trying to objectively rate creative expression, I opted\r\nto play Clysm\'s \"Turmoil\" because I do think it\'s a very good baseline for\r\ntrying to grasp the difference between a \"good\" ZZT game and a \"bad\" ZZT game.\r\nIt splits the difference and is about as average as a ZZT game can get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So recalibrate your perception of average to whatever I think it is, and\r\nlet\'s check out Clysm\'s \"Turmoil\"!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/turmoil/zzt_001.png\'%}\" alt=\"001\">\r\n\r\n<p>The world opens to this cool looking title screen with white text and\r\ncolored highlights.

The game is pretty easy, and the combat involved is fairly barebones,\r\nbut there\'s definitely plenty of charm to it. Despite the simplicity of the\r\ngame\'s graphics, Clysm does an excellent job creating worlds which are both\r\nvaried and memorable with little more than some small exposition by Boris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game\'s cast is very samey. None of the crew really seems to have much\r\npersonality, to the point where I completely forgot that though the game seems\r\nto end on a positive note, Masher is just gone. Boris is the only character who\r\never really has a chance to show any personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turmoil is a game that fuels the player\'s imagination. When you look at\r\nwhat\'s actually there, it\'s not much, but it\'s just enough to get your brain to\r\nstart filling in the blanks on its own. The missions are just an excuse to send\r\nthe player on a journey across the galaxy, fighting strange creatures, helping\r\nthose in need, and moving on to the next planet when the situation\'s been\r\nresolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has its memorable moments, like the surprise hut ambush, a feat that would\r\nbe difficult to pull in a medium that isn\'t ZZT. (Then again, there\'s always\r\nBaba Yaga.) The missions play out very similarly, but always feel fresh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ending is rather strange, and I wonder if there was ever an intent on\r\nmaking a sequel. It happens rather abruptly in what feels like the height of the\r\nstory\'s tension only to just come to a sudden stop. There\'s a lot left\r\nunanswered in the ending. Masher is just gone and the crew is stranded. It\'s a\r\npretty grim situation, but this new life on an alien world is one that the\r\nPlecostatmus crew looks forward to with a boundless optimism.\r\nThis world is just their latest mission.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of \r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-12-10',1,'django',2,194,'',''),(196,'Closer Look: Virus 302: Special Edition','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get Virus 302 Special Edition?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Virus 302 Special Edition is available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=V302SE.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_V302SE\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>.\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also explore the world yourself on the \r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/v/V302SE.zip?file=V302SE.ZZT&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT Public Beta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_002.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n<h2>Virus 302 Special Edition</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Dr. Dos<br>\r\nPublished Under: Global Gaming Interactive<br>\r\nReleased: Apr. 6, 2002\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of you just joining us, earlier this month I streamed Virus 302,\r\nmy first released ZZT game. I made it when I was 10 and being 10 was not exactly\r\nexperienced in good game design. It was a very bad game with a very nonsensical\r\nplot, but good for some laughs in a modern context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My original plan was to stream the Special Edition as well, but I opted to\r\nwrite about it directly instead. V302:SE was made when I was 13 years old. I\r\nknew it would still be bad, and figured I\'d be harsher on it since I would\r\nimagine my abilities with ZZT would have improved a lot, and I\'d have a better\r\nsense of design sensibilities, but I have to say, it\'s honestly worse. Like, I\r\ngenuinely question what made me think I should release it. There\'s plenty to\r\ngo over here, and you may want to compare and contrast against the original\r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/v/virus302.zip?file=Virus302.zzt&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Virus 302</a>\r\nusing the Museum file viewer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or if you\'re really feeling daring, the live playthrough is on\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPkQcmt2UwU\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>\r\n.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_002.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game\'s title screen is a mess to begin with. Only half of the \"V\" has\r\ndepth added to it for some reason, and the other letters look very blocky as the\r\nshading runs into more of the letters themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"2\" mostly looks like a \"2\" though, which is more than can be said about\r\nthe original game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_003.png\'%}\" alt=\"003\">\r\n\r\n<p>The game itself opens just as the original with the player in his house.

If you manage to hit for 6 damage the text appears in colors to\r\nsignify the extra damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arrow object moves fast, but there\'s a lot of room for error with how\r\nmuch health you have.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_040.png\'%}\" alt=\"040\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_042.png\'%}\" alt=\"042\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player is dumped back into the mayor\'s house, and this time can unlock\r\nthe door to the closet and pick up a pistol and some ammo. This sounds useful,\r\nbut without any car keys there\'s no way to leave town.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_044.png\'%}\" alt=\"044\">\r\n\r\n<p>Oh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, I\'ll accept using some tiny part of a pistol as a makeshift lockpick to\r\nbreak into your car, but that won\'t cut it for the ignition.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_045.png\'%}\" alt=\"045\">\r\n\r\n<p>So here\'s the world map! The original game has a \"teleportation station\"\r\nwhich was just a series of passages, so even this work of art is a step up, but\r\nI\'m amazed that most of the locations haven\'t even attempted to be drawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The player is given a bit of freedom as for where to go:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Pawn Shop</li>\r\n    <li>Town</li>\r\n    <li>Cavern</li>\r\n    <li>Old Yass Plains</li>\r\n    <li>Security Booth</li>\r\n    <li>Clock Tower</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>And you couldn\'t tell what any of those places were just by looking on the \r\nworld map.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_046.png\'%}\" alt=\"046\">\r\n\r\n<p>My first stop is the Pawn shop, where to save objects I used blink wall rays\r\nto make the windows. Except then in the center I used an actual blink wall\r\ninstead of an object, so parts of the windows flicker on and off.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_047.png\'%}\" alt=\"047\">\r\n\r\n<p>The pawn shop is closed though, so it\'s immediately time to turn around.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_048.png\'%}\" alt=\"048\">\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of time, the clock tower is this ugly brown building.

I don\'t know why I kept this content.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_052.png\'%}\" alt=\"052\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_053.png\'%}\" alt=\"053\">\r\n\r\n<p>THIS IS COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT FOR THE PLAYER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two paths the player needs to take if they want to get an optional\r\nbonus. The south path is full of ruffians.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_055.png\'%}\" alt=\"055\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"054\">\r\n\r\n<p>The good ruffian gives some supplies, and one of the red keys to get the\r\narea\'s reward if they\'re willing to put up with this.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_056.png\'%}\" alt=\"056\">\r\n\r\n<p>The north path contains lions, and this \"troll\" who just moves around and\r\nshoots randomly. You might think it\'s a dead end, but if you go north on\r\nexactly one tile, you can proceed to the next room! Wow!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_058.png\'%}\" alt=\"058\">\r\n\r\n<p>That next room is a maze. In the original game the player has to navigate\r\nalong an invisible path of fake walls, but here an object mercifully reveals\r\nthe path automatically. So clearly I was aware that this sort of thing was not\r\nfun, but kept it in anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_059.png\'%}\" alt=\"059\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_060.png\'%}\" alt=\"060\">\r\n\r\n<p>So here the player reaches the boss of the Old Yass Plains, the Anti-Virus\r\nHologram. Except the player has no idea who this character is, unlike in the\r\noriginal where by now they\'d know him as the villain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He runs around and shoots, and sometimes throws stars, but thankfully not so\r\nmany that the fight becomes impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_062.png\'%}\" alt=\"062\">\r\n\r\n<p>The reward for the area is a bunch of gems, but the true benefit is that\r\nfinishing the plains advances the game\'s clock.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_063.png\'%}\" alt=\"063\">\r\n\r\n<p>Now that lunchtime is over, the pawn shop is open. Or, at least it\r\nwould be, but the code tries to jump to a label called \"unlock\".\r\nUnlock is a reserved word in ZZT-OOP since it\'s a command, and so\r\nthe game never jumps to the label and I had to cheat to enter.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_065.png\'%}\" alt=\"065\">\r\n\r\n<p>The pawn shop, like all pawn shops is completely empty of stock on the floor,\r\n but loaded with bushes and a drinking fountain.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_066.png\'%}\" alt=\"066\">\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t recall which game I got this drinking fountain mechanic from, but I\r\nliked it then and I liked it now. You can drink as often as you like, and you\r\ngain one health for doing so, but it pops up a message requiring the player to\r\nhave to hit enter to be able to drink again. If the player wants to invest time\r\nin getting free health, they can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it\'s a good mechanic as a little easter egg sort of thing. If the\r\nplayer finds themselves running into a drinking fountain in order to have a\r\nchance at survival, it would be pretty garbage to rely on.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_069.png\'%}\" alt=\"069\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_070.png\'%}\" alt=\"070\">\r\n\r\n<p>The pawn shop only sells a shotgun and a weapon permit. You can\'t just buy\r\nan AK-47 in this world. I pick up both of them because better weapons can only\r\nmake the game go faster. Afterwards, it\'s back to the world map.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_071.png\'%}\" alt=\"071\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_072.png\'%}\" alt=\"072\">\r\n\r\n<p>The security checkpoint continues the trend of being a place to go without\r\nanything to do.

The gameplay is really straightforward here\r\nand the overwrought cave intro is pretty funny in comparison to the actual cave\r\nbeing just a gray room with some bats.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_079.png\'%}\" alt=\"079\">\r\n\r\n<p>But wait! Up ahead on the next board, it\'s the mark of a true ZZTer, it\'s an\r\nRPG battle!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_081.png\'%}\" alt=\"081\">\r\n\r\n<p>Despite thinking these engines were the coolest as a kid, I immediately\r\ndownplay it as a standard affair, and mention how you might get bored so there\'s\r\nsome music to listen to. First off, yes, you will get bored during all the many\r\nRPG battles this game has. Secondly, there is no music to choose from.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_083.png\'%}\" alt=\"083\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a lot to see on this board. It\'s heavily inspired by Final Fantasy 7,\r\nincluding limit breaks. The timers for you and the enemy slowly fill up. When\r\nyours fills, a menu pops up letting you choose if you want to attack, use an\r\nitem, or defend. There is no reason to ever defend, and the player won\'t have\r\nany healing items available at this point, so instead you just pick attack until\r\nyou win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The screen shows your weapon, and reveals all four that are available at some\r\npoint in the game. That star in the middle surrounded by water, boulders, and\r\nfake walls, is the system\'s random number generator. When you roll for damage,\r\nthe object in the center shoots in a random direction and hits one of the\r\nobjects which represent 1, 2, 3, or 4 damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly is the limit break meter, which should fill as you take damage like in\r\nFinal Fantasy 7, but in nearly all of this games battles, doesn\'t actually fill\r\nup ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_084.png\'%}\" alt=\"084\">\r\n\r\n<p>The reward for defeating the spider is some gems, and a uniform you steal\r\nfrom a corpse so it\'ll look like you work at the security booth.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_087.png\'%}\" alt=\"087\">\r\n\r\n<p>Now disguised, the guards let the player go inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_089.png\'%}\" alt=\"089\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_090.png\'%}\" alt=\"090\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_091.png\'%}\" alt=\"091\">\r\n\r\n<p>The checkpoint is pretty empty, with nothing more than a red carpet. A\r\nhelpful computer monitor informs the player that there will be instant game\r\novers coming up if they aren\'t careful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The player also got the guard\'s ID card from the cave, but has yet to read\r\nthe data off of it. The reality is that you\'re supposed to go back to the\r\nplayer\'s house and use the scanner to get the information needed. Of course,\r\nthe passage to leave the security checkpoint mistakenly links to the same board\r\nso I\'m stuck here and had to look up the information in the editor!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_092.png\'%}\" alt=\"092\">\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody\'s getting their ID cards renewed, and none of them noticed this one\r\ndesk with no line at all.

The alternate ID is listed as \"Square Clock Wise\", which\r\nI thought was a trick to mean the answer is \"78963214\" (a square on a keyboard\'s\r\nnumber pad), but the game actually accepts both the number and the phrase as\r\ncorrect answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_102.png\'%}\" alt=\"102\">\r\n\r\n<p>With the ID card updated, the player can explore the rest of the checkpoint,\r\nwhich consists of an empty room with stairs. Another guard believes you to be\r\none of the generals, and that they\'re under attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far this game has had a dueling engine, a traditional RPG battle engine,\r\nso I guess some sort of minigame where you direct a bunch of troops in order to\r\nwin a battle would be reasonable to expect. Maybe set tactics or just placement,\r\nand do so in a way that the enemy forces get outgunned.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_108.png\'%}\" alt=\"108\">\r\n\r\n<p>Ha ha just kidding.

The new locations are the City of ZZT, the red plains, and the forest\r\nof ZZT. The map mechanic is pretty pointless since the rest of the game is\r\nstrictly linear. There aren\'t even passages for the other areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also want to point out that we\'re now halfway through this game, and so far\r\nthe villain has not been revealed, explained, or hinted at in any way other than\r\nthe content taken directly from the original game in an area the player is told\r\nis optional.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_111.png\'%}\" alt=\"111\">\r\n\r\n<p>I got a laugh in my stream of the original Virus 302\'s City of ZZT which\r\nconsisted of three buildings.

The weird \"What can I get now\" choice only shows up when you\r\nhave a weapons permit purchased from the pawn shop which lets you buy the AK\r\nwithout a bribe attached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second building sells items. It\'s possible to buy a first aid kit, or a\r\nlarger medkit here. These don\'t increase your health directly, but instead are\r\nused in the RPG fights throughout the game as healing there. You can only carry\r\none of each of these due to ZZT\'s flag system and limits making it a huge pain\r\nto have a custom counter. What other RPGs often did instead, was use torches to\r\nrepresent healing items and avoid all the micromanagement of code.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_116.png\'%}\" alt=\"116\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_117.png\'%}\" alt=\"117\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/virus-302-special-edition/zzt_118.png\'%}\" alt=\"118\">\r\n\r\n<p>The last building can actually be entered.

I can maybe believe at\r\n13 thinking \"This is definitely gameplay people will love\", but I can\'t get over\r\nhow incredibly buggy it is, and how many of those bugs would have been caught if\r\nthere was any testing. This playthrough must actually have been the first time\r\nI actually played the game all the way through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graphics are a step up only in the sense that there are more colors to\r\nuse rather than using color effectively. The game\'s action sequences, even if\r\nmost of them weren\'t broken to pieces, would be just as uninspired as the old\r\ngame\'s lions and tigers. The RPG battles are too easy, too slow, and too\r\nrepetitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story was nonsense in the original, and continues be the same. The only\r\nreal changes are to some characters names to make them more timely. Characters\r\nin the special edition still show up out of nowhere, have relations which the\r\nplayer is expected to take on blind faith, and have no real motivation beyond\r\nfollowing the script of the original game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still think for me personally, this is a really neat time capsule. The fact\r\nthat it\'s a remake rather than an original creation makes it a great way to\r\ncompare what I thought a good ZZT game was at 13. The answer appears to be\r\nskyline fades, RPG battles with limit breaks, and obtuse puzzles and secrets.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may be the worst special edition since Star Wars (ha ha), but it\'s not\r\ntaking something good and egotistically saying \"But I can do better this time\".\r\nIt\'s taking what is still very bad source material, and somehow managing to turn\r\nit into something even less appealing. I don\'t believe anybody has ever actually\r\nplayed this, and I hope they haven\'t. It\'s just plain unplayable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly I need to remake it again. I can do better this time...</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of \r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-12-19',1,'django',2,196,'',''),(198,'Closer Look: Nightmare','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get Nightmare?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nightmare is available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=nmzzt.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_nmzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>.\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also explore the world yourself on the \r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/n/nmzzt.zip?file=NGHTMARE.ZZT&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT Public Beta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_001.png\'%}\" alt=\"001\">\r\n<h2>Nightmare</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Barjesse<br>\r\n<!--Published Under: <br>-->\r\nReleased: Jul. 18, 1996\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div><em>You went to sleep tonight as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dressed for bed as usual.<br>\r\nYou pulled back the covers as usual.<br>\r\nYou turned out the light as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that\'s where the usual stopped.</em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Barjesse\'s Nightmare is a ZZT game that really stands out among the rest.

Another\r\nline in the intro allows the player to read the credits and get some supplies\r\nfor doing so, which will ultimately be a wise decision as this board is the only\r\nsource of ammo in the game.

You will need\r\nto deduce what that objective is, and how\r\nto achieve it.\r\n\r\n(A caution to chronic cheaters here: If\r\nyou zap around in here, you will not be\r\nable to win the game!)\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_018.png\'%}\" alt=\"018\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_019.png\'%}\" alt=\"019\">\r\n\r\n<p>This board consists of four smaller puzzles, trying to interpret the dreams\r\nand figure out how to proceed. The first dream is in the bottom left, the player\r\ncontrols an object in a room filled with tigers. The object can move, but can\'t\r\nshoot (not that object bullets can harm creatures anyway). The player has to\r\ncrush the tigers against each other to defeat them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to this, I never realized the weird behavior with pushing and crushing\r\nZZT has here. If you push a tiger into another tiger, and that tiger can\'t be\r\npushed as well, then a tiger gets crushed. However, if you try to push a tiger\r\nthat\'s next to a wall, it will consider the movement blocked and the tiger will\r\nlive. The bottom of the room has an object which will destroy tigers pushed into\r\nit, so as the numbers dwindle it becomes easier to use the object instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One minor annoyance with this dream, is that the tigers will generally try to\r\nmove towards the real player, who juts out into the room. This causes the tigers\r\nto have to be pushed first out of the way of the player until they move to the\r\nbottom row where they can be eliminated. It can be a bit of a nuisance.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_022.png\'%}\" alt=\"022\">\r\n\r\n<p>The second dream involves catching a blue object that runs around the room\r\n(look in the top left!) which causes all the bullets on screen to turn into fake\r\nwalls. The object moves in a counter-clockwise square so it\'s easy to catch\r\nwhich is good since the bullets will be shot randomly, and the player has to\r\nmake a bridge of fake walls across the river.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_025.png\'%}\" alt=\"025\">\r\n\r\n<p>It can take a bit before a suitable crossing is complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_028.png\'%}\" alt=\"028\">\r\n\r\n<p>The third dream has you controlling a slightly different object. This one\r\nmoves and shoots in the direction pressed on the keyboard. A single purple\r\nobject will be visible at any time, and need to be shot. To make things more of\r\na challenge, shooting the empty spaces will reset the puzzle. The player has to\r\nstep carefully in order to shoot the star in the correct order.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_030.png\'%}\" alt=\"030\">\r\n\r\n<p>The final dream is the strangest of them all. A small maze is filled with\r\nslimes. The player\'s goal is to destroy them. This is done by blocking their\r\npath causing them to fizzle out. At the same time however, their trail of\r\nbreakable walls is randomly erased, leading to the slimes having another\r\noutbreak.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_035.png\'%}\" alt=\"035\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_036.png\'%}\" alt=\"036\">\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, the player will have them cornered and be able to destroy them\r\ncompletely. Be cautious about touching the controls as the dream sequence ends\r\nhowever! In my case here the controls didn\'t erase themselves and blocked the\r\npath back to the hub, trapping me in the eastern path and forcing me to restart\r\n(or zap, but I figured I\'d just reset since it was so early).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fake walls appear around the room, which are used as a convenient way to mark\r\nboard exits. There\'s also a piece of the player\'s consciousness as a reward!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_051.png\'%}\" alt=\"051\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_052.png\'%}\" alt=\"052\">\r\n\r\n<p>Nightmare is divided into two types of puzzles, minor ones like the clock\r\nroom which are used to get from point A to point B, and major ones like this\r\nwhich return a piece of consciousness to the player. In order to wake up, the\r\nplayer has to solve all thirteen major puzzles to gain all the letters that make\r\nup the word CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_040.png\'%}\" alt=\"040\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next major puzzle is to the south, and consists of using a robot to\r\ncollect spinning triangles. The player has to use the controls provided to move\r\nthe robot in each direction, as well as two additional buttons to shoot either\r\neast and west or north and south simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complicating things is that some of the triangles refuse to be collected\r\nuntil others have been. There\'s no real indication of what the correct order is,\r\nand it seems like there\'s some flexibility to it, but you\'ll always be able to\r\ncollect if you go in the order of ZZT\'s colors: blue, green, cyan, red, purple,\r\nyellow, white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game warns about making the board unwinnable, and while it would be\r\npossible to do so, it would be very difficult to mangle the extremely basic\r\nboulder and slider puzzles to actually get stuck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One nice touch of this engine is that the robot can pick up keys and open\r\ndoors. It\'s all done with other objects, but plays ZZT\'s key and door sounds\r\nappropriately.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_046.png\'%}\" alt=\"046\">\r\n\r\n<p>When the puzzle\'s completed, the player has a long walk to obtain the white\r\ntriangle, which states that it should be touched from the right rather than the\r\nleft when touched otherwise. It\'s a pointless walk, and I\'d have preferred for\r\nthe white triangle to just be put behind 7 solid walls and more readily\r\ncollected.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_047.png\'%}\" alt=\"047\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_048.png\'%}\" alt=\"048\">\r\n\r\n<p>Oddly, despite their being a path west, the player is unable to travel down\r\nit. This will be revealed later as to why, but for now, it\'s back to the room of\r\nfour dreams, and this time the eastern path.</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- talk about flag management when the hub piece is collected -->\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/conveyor.png\'%}\" alt=\"conveyor\"}>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}@A small green room...\r\n\r\nYou walk into a room with BRIGHT green\r\nwalls.

The first, is to make it inside\r\nthe vault where the dream glitches are kept. After reading the sign some music\r\nnotes appear which play parts of \"Rock A Bye Baby\" when touched. Once the tune\r\nhas been played in order the player can enter the vault itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_060.png\'%}\" alt=\"060\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next portion is to collect all the dream glitches in the vault which can\r\nbe dissipated by your touch. At first glance, the vault appears to just be a\r\nmaze filled with red dots to collect, but look closely and you\'ll see that the\r\nwalls also have conveyors scattered throughout. The player has to navigate the\r\nmaze in a way to be able to collect the pieces, and also move with the flow of\r\nthe conveyors (or simply mash their keyboard to go against them). The sudden\r\nzippy movement of being along a conveyor really caught me off guard when I was\r\nfirst navigating the vault maze. The choice of dark green on dark cyan is very\r\ndeliberate here with how well the colors blend into each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_062.png\'%}\" alt=\"062\">\r\n\r\n<p>This puzzle counts as a major one, and the player is rewarded with a piece\r\nof consciousness. There\'s one more path in the east wing to explore, but I may\r\nhave forgotten about it at first. Whoops.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_063.png\'%}\" alt=\"063\">\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, one really awesome feature that Barjesse thought to include in\r\nNightmare, was minimizing backtracking. When the player moves west on the board\r\nwith the four dreams, rather than going back to the clock room, they\'re taken\r\ndirectly to the hub. Since approaching from the east means the player has solved\r\nthe clock puzzle already, Barjesse saved the player from having to traverse a\r\nnow empty room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, look up and you\'ll see the letters that the player has collected so\r\nfar appear. This serves as an indicator of progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_064.png\'%}\" alt=\"064\">\r\n\r\n<p>While walking across the hub, the player will stumble upon a piece of\r\nconsciousness that the Sandman forgot to hide in a puzzle. You might think that\r\nfinding a hidden object that gives you a letter is far worse than any puzzle,\r\nbut the game is not cruel. There\'s a simple timer on the board and the player\r\nwill automatically pick up the letter after spending enough time on the board.\r\nThis being the hub of the game, there\'s no worry the player will ever not be\r\nable to find the piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One last thing to point out here, is that the player needs to collect a total\r\nof thirteen letters to spell CONSCIOUSNESS, and ZZT can only store ten flags.\r\nThe game actually uses some clever memory management to keep track of all the\r\nletters. Firstly, the one that\'s on this board doesn\'t need a flag since it\'s on\r\nthe board that checks if you have all the letters to begin with. So in reality\r\nthere are twelve letters and ten flags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Barjesse did, was have each letter check what letters you currently have\r\nin a four letter chunk and adjust a flag appropriately. So you\'ll pick up the C\r\nand get a flag \"CXXX\". Then pick up an N and it will erase \"CXXX\" and set \"CXNX\"\r\nin its place! This way the game only needs three flags which are manipulated to\r\nhold the state of four letters each. It\'s a clever workaround to ZZT\'s lack of\r\ndata storage.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_071.png\'%}\" alt=\"071\">\r\n\r\n<p>Going back through the clock room and four dreams room to the northern\r\nunexplored room leads to another maze.</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}@AAACK!! What a MESS!!\r\nOh, boy.\r\n\r\nYou\'ve just wandered into the tank that\r\nholds the dream element of instability.\r\n\r\nThis is the stuff that makes the location\r\nof your dream change every time you turn\r\naround.\r\n\r\n$...and I\r\n$ think\r\n$I\'ll\r\n$crush this bit of consciousness\r\n$ into smaller bits...\r\n\r\nThe Sandman\'s voice echoes through the\r\nchamber of the tank, as if it was\r\nsomething he\'d said some time ago.\r\n\r\nLooking around, you indeed see tiny pieces\r\nof consciousness lying around.\r\n\r\nIt looks like you\'re going to have to\r\ngather them up and piece them back\r\ntogether like some abstract jigsaw puzzle.\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_072.png\'%}\" alt=\"072\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_073.png\'%}\" alt=\"073\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_075.png\'%}\" alt=\"075\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_076.png\'%}\" alt=\"076\">\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to the conveyor maze, this board also consists of picking up the\r\npieces.

Unlike the robot puzzle\r\nwith the colored triangles, there\'s no order enforced, and whichever one gets\r\nshot is one step closer to finishing the puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge comes from the dark blue ricochets within the box that will\r\ndeflect any bullets that come near.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_113.png\'%}\" alt=\"113\">\r\n\r\n<p>So, shooting east from where the player is here, despite aiming directly at\r\n#6, causes a ricochet to deflect the bullet upwards and hit target #2 instead.\r\nYou basically need to draw imaginary lines out from the numbers to find out what\r\ndirection they can actually be hit from, and then follow any ricochets to figure\r\nout where you\'re supposed to stand to actually hit the target. It\'s actually a\r\nlot of fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My only complaint, is that one ricochet outside of the box. If it wasn\'t\r\nthere, the #1 target would be able to be shot from two different directions\r\nwhich I suppose Barjesse didn\'t want, as all the others have only one vulnerable\r\nspot. However, that ricochet looks extremely out of place. I think a more\r\nreasonable alternative would have just been to extend the box down an extra row\r\nand place a solid wall or ricochet directly below the one.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_121.png\'%}\" alt=\"121\">\r\n\r\n<p>The Black Box counts as a major puzzle and gives the player a C as well as\r\nopening up new paths from this board.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_122.png\'%}\" alt=\"122\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_123.png\'%}\" alt=\"123\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_124.png\'%}\" alt=\"124\">\r\n\r\n<p>To the west is a desolate looking board that is supposed to be the Sandman\'s\r\nworkshop.

While the first puzzle\'s controls were arranged more\r\nsensibly, here from top to bottom the controls are west, shoot, south, north,\r\nand east. Shooting is done in the last direction the robot moved in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The less logical (to me at least) order, means a lot of fumbling with the\r\ncontrols as you accidentally press the wrong button, and realize you now need\r\nto correct the mistake and then hit the button you needed to press to begin\r\nwith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first order of business is escaping from the room in the top left area\r\nwhich requires finding a fake wall. Graciously, there are some dark blue fakes\r\nnear the exit to guide the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_127.png\'%}\" alt=\"127\">\r\n\r\n<p>Once free of the bright blue room, the robot needs to push the key into the\r\nconveyors to get it out into the main area. At first glance it may look like the\r\nkey is now stuck on the bottom row, but there\'s a small groove in the rightmost\r\nroom which lets the robot get back underneath the key and push it upwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_128.png\'%}\" alt=\"128\">\r\n\r\n<p>The way pushed elements ignore whatever is underneath them means that a trail\r\nis left across the floor as the key is moved. Perhaps it would\'ve looked nicer\r\nwithout the brown carpeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_130.png\'%}\" alt=\"130\">\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless, once the key has been safely pushed into the final conveyors, the\r\nplayer can collect it and open the door to their next piece of consciousness, an\r\n\"I\".

The player has to destroy\r\nbreakable walls to make their way up the board. The room wraps horizontally, so\r\nrunning off the right edge will place the player on the left. What challenge\r\nthere is comes from some of the breakables actually being objects which shoot\r\nback at the player when shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_174.png\'%}\" alt=\"174\">\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s pretty weak, and even when making mistakes very simple to not get shot\r\nmost of the time just by keeping your distance. Alternatively, you can just\r\nstand point blank like this and always be safe. You can\'t shoot objects at point\r\nblank range, so a false will won\'t even waste a bullet. You can shoot breakable\r\nwalls at point blank so if the wall really is breakable it will be destroyed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_175.png\'%}\" alt=\"175\">\r\n\r\n<p>Opening the door offers a shortcut in case the player ever goes north from\r\nthe hub again as this board would be quite a pain to navigate when solved.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_177.png\'%}\" alt=\"177\">\r\n\r\n<p>Touching purple walls alters the path, allowing passage to the northern room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_178.png\'%}\" alt=\"178\">\r\n\r\n<p>This puzzle is another fun one. A cannon can be used by the player to fire a\r\nshot, and when an arrow is shot, it will shoot back in the direction it\'s\r\npointing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four large buttons as well, which rotate the arrows of a matching\r\ncolor. Every arrow of a color will rotate the same way, but some buttons make\r\ntheir color rotate clockwise and others counter-clockwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_182.png\'%}\" alt=\"182\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player needs to spin things in such a way that all the breakable walls in\r\nthe room will be destroyed. The player might try to be clever have two arrows\r\nface each other so they can rotate arrows while a bullet bounces back and forth\r\nessentially endlessly, but the buttons are purposely slow to press making it\r\nvery difficult to try and adjust arrows fast enough when there\'s already a\r\nbullet traveling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s not perfect though, and with some long shots you can react fast enough\r\nto change things. It\'s also not uncommon to have an arrow be hit just as it\r\nwould be rotating from the button causing it to react to the bullet and not\r\nrotate. It is possible to (for better or for worse) prevent a single arrow from\r\nspinning this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the goal was to not manipulate arrows while there was a bullet around,\r\nsimple having the buttons check for a bullet on screen before allowing them to\r\nbe pressed would have prevented it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_188.png\'%}\" alt=\"188\">\r\n\r\n<p>To make things difficult, after a certain number of shots, the gun is\r\ndestroyed by the Sandman and the player has to use their own ammunition.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_196.png\'%}\" alt=\"196\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_197.png\'%}\" alt=\"197\">\r\n\r\n<p>Solving the puzzle gives the player their \"U\".</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_201.png\'%}\" alt=\"201\">\r\n\r\n<p>And touching all three purple walls turns the scroll into another \"O\" as\r\nwell.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_203.png\'%}\" alt=\"203\">\r\n\r\n<p>Things are really coming along now, with only three letters remaining before\r\nthe player can finally wake up.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_205.png\'%}\" alt=\"205\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_204.png\'%}\" alt=\"204\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_206.png\'%}\" alt=\"206\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_207.png\'%}\" alt=\"207\">\r\n\r\n<p>Slider puzzles in ZZT have a bit of a bad rap. They can be pretty tough for\r\nsure, but they always look a lot more difficult than the actually are. This\r\nboard is thankfully nice enough to compartmentalize them, and the smaller a room\r\nis, the fewer possible moves there are, and the easier it is to solve one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s not too much to say about slider puzzles. You either solve them or\r\nyou don\'t. Perhaps it\'s best told by combining all the in-progress screenshots I\r\ntook into a nice little gif to watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/slider.gif\'%}\" alt=\"slider\">\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s fun to see these solved like this, even if this is just haphazardly\r\ntaken screenshots. Note that the white segment is just a linear path and the\r\nonly puzzle is not accidentally pushing a boulder and trapping yourself!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_248.png\'%}\" alt=\"248\">\r\n\r\n<p>Once the exit gate is reached, some objects will pave a path of fake walls to\r\nonce again save on backtracking.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_250.png\'%}\" alt=\"250\">\r\n\r\n<p>And here we have the last branching path of the game. To me, this board looks\r\na lot like the hub of Town of ZZT. Apparently normal walls and a plus shape are\r\nall it takes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This puzzle, I find scarier than the sliders from earlier. Here there are a\r\ndozen boulders to push, and transporters are involved so the effects of moving\r\nsomething are even more difficult to follow than before.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_253.png\'%}\" alt=\"253\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_254.png\'%}\" alt=\"254\">\r\n\r\n<p>Either I stumbled into the solution, or it\'s a fake puzzle and there aren\'t\r\nany actual ways to prevent solving it. Pushing in all the boulders where it\'s\r\npossible to do so opens up the last three paths, and gives the player a \"C\".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eastern path leads all the way back to the triangle piece room, meaning\r\nthese next two rooms will be the last. Coincidentally, I also feel they\'re the\r\ngame\'s two worst puzzles.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_262.png\'%}\" alt=\"262\">\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}@What\'s a black box?\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n$Behold my lovely black box:\r\n\r\n$A puzzling marvel,\r\n$A marvelous puzzle\r\n\r\n\r\n$You may have seen my other one --\r\n$(I have yet to conceal its innards)\r\n$ be assured:\r\n$this one\'s my favorite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$A black box is a scientist\'s puzzle:\r\n\r\n$Given an opaque box,\r\n$discover what you can about\r\n$ what\'s inside.\r\n\r\n$Mine is a variation on this theme:\r\n$Given a box full of --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$But I\'ve already given\r\n$too much\r\n$away.\r\n\r\n$You\'ll figure it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n$(I say as I stifle a snicker...)\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>What we have here is a repeat of the previous Black Box puzzle, but this time\r\nit\'s a SUPER Black Box according to the board\'s title. So what makes Black Box\r\none of my favorite puzzles, but Super Black Box one of my least?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, you have to do it blindly this time. The first puzzle worked well\r\nbecause you had all the information, and just had to piece it together. Super\r\nBlack Box makes you just move from one tile to the next, shooting, and hoping it\r\nworks. You could make a map yourself and try to identify where all the ricochets\r\nare located, but brute force is faster here. The lack of contrast also makes it\r\nmore likely that your shots will be slightly off when making a long distance\r\nshot upwards from the bottom of the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_272.png\'%}\" alt=\"272\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_273.png\'%}\" alt=\"273\">\r\n\r\n<p>The puzzle is eventually solved, and when you finish it the \"S\" reward begins\r\nrunning around doing laps around the board until the player catches it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s actually VERY important to catch the \"S\" fast. If you catch it on its\r\nfirst lap you get bonus points. If you catch it on its second lap you don\'t. If\r\nyou don\'t catch it on the second lap, it mistakenly #zaps the touch label again\r\nresulting in the S being unable to be collected and rendering the game\r\nunwinnable! Your best bet is to use the first lap to line yourself up with it\r\non one of the horizontal stretches across the top or bottom, and then letting it\r\nrun into you on the second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the \"S\" collected, there\'s just a single letter remaining. The last\r\npuzzle is west of the not Town of ZZT room, and it\'s also a disappointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_278.png\'%}\" alt=\"278\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_275.png\'%}\" alt=\"275\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_276.png\'%}\" alt=\"276\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_277.png\'%}\" alt=\"277\">\r\n\r\n<p>So this final puzzle is a transporter maze. There\'s nothing wrong with that.\r\nIt\'s a twisty little maze and ZZT\'s behavior for transporters is pretty complex\r\nbased on whether there\'s a matching transporter on the other end, or if the\r\nspace the transporter is pointing towards is empty. It makes it easy to create\r\none way passages or transporters that don\'t let you even go through them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It starts out fun to work your way through, and unlike slider puzzles, there\r\nisn\'t any harm in transporting all over the place unlike pushing sliders\r\nhaphazardly so the player can feel out the solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_279.png\'%}\" alt=\"279\">\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, the player will make it into this room with a small purple\r\nobject.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_280.png\'%}\" alt=\"280\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_281.png\'%}\" alt=\"281\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_282.png\'%}\" alt=\"282\">\r\n\r\n<p>The clod of sleep is a boulder, and by blocking a transporter, causes its\r\nbehavior to go from placing the player where the boulder is now, to transporting\r\nthem to the very bottom room which is necessary to be able to reach the goal\r\nroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then this happens...</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_283.png\'%}\" alt=\"283\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_284.png\'%}\" alt=\"284\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_285.png\'%}\" alt=\"285\">\r\n\r\n<p>Sure enough, the last letter phases into the lower left room and the player\r\nhas a new room to try to get to.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_288.png\'%}\" alt=\"288\">\r\n\r\n<p>The solution is once more to use sleep to block off a transporter and make it\r\nto the last letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_289.png\'%}\" alt=\"289\">\r\n\r\n<p>And this is the moment where you\'ll realize why this puzzle is terrible. With\r\nno boulders in the way, this transporter places the player a single tile to the\r\nleft of it. Once two boulders block that path, they\'ll go to the bottom middle\r\nroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_290.png\'%}\" alt=\"290\">\r\n\r\n<p>To get to the bottom left room, they have to push a boulder through that\r\ntransporter NINE times.

For\r\nthe first two, it\'s possible to use an extra boulder and allow you to get back\r\nto the sleep room right away, but eventually there will be no more room to push\r\nthings through on this path and you\'re stuck doing things the long way.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_292.png\'%}\" alt=\"292\">\r\n\r\n<p>After a lot of tedium, the player can obtain the last letter and wake\r\nthemselves up.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_294.png\'%}\" alt=\"294\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_295.png\'%}\" alt=\"295\">','','2016-12-31',1,'django',2,198,'',''),(200,'Closer Look: Nightmare','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/nightmare/zzt_296.png\'%}\" alt=\"296\">\r\n\r\n<p>See that tiny dark purple passage?

The puzzles are fun, fair, and strike a good balance between the\r\neffort required to solving them and the interest the player will actually have\r\nwhile solving them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game is visually striking, the ever shifting colors of the main hub are\r\nunlike any other ZZT board I\'ve seen. There\'s a lot of good use of colors in\r\nthe various mazes. (Though the one that\'s solid white is a bit of an eye\r\nstrain.) The conveyor maze blends similar colors together in such a way that the\r\nplayer will likely be caught off guard. Muted scenes like the riddle board still\r\nmanage to look good, even when they don\'t have that bright pop seen elsewhere.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The puzzles themselves are a good variety and play to ZZT\'s strengths.\r\nsliders, transporters, walls and floors witching places, all of these are the\r\nkind of puzzles you\'ll find in ZZT, but not really anywhere else. Some puzzles\r\nmay be a bit weak, like the riddles having to be multiple choice or moving a\r\nrobot around an empty room to get a key, but the lower quality puzzles come off\r\nas filler, not bad design. Nightmare is nothing more than a collection of\r\npuzzles, and what\'s offered makes for an extremely enjoyable experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I strongly suggest that you try the game yourself if you haven\'t already.\r\nYou\'ll need a good two hours to get through (making this the longest game I\'ve\r\ncovered yet), and it\'s time that\'s well spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goodnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of \r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-12-31',1,'django',3,198,'',''),(201,'An Interview With Jim Crawford - Frog Fractions 2 and ZZT','Dr. Dos','Interview','<figure>\r\n<a href=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/jim-crawford-interview/ff2.png\'%}\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/jim-crawford-interview/ff2.png\'%}\" alt=\"Frog Fractions 2\" style=\"max-width:600px\">\r\n</a>\r\n<figcaption>Frog Fractions 2: TXT WORLD!</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>So I have to admit, whatever I was expecting <em>Frog Fractions 2</em> to be, it was\r\ncertainly not a text game that looks and feels like ZZT.

He responded saying that he\'d be happy to answer some questions.\r\nSo I sent him a few, and got the following responses:</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did you first find ZZT? Are there any particular worlds you have strong\r\nmemories of?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"When I was 12 or so my mom\'s boyfriend bought a CD-ROM drive and a 3 CD set\r\ncalled <em>Shareware Bonanza</em>, which was almost certainly the result of a process\r\nlike telling an intern \"download everything from every BBS until you have enough\r\nto fill up these 1.8 gigs.\" Chunks of content were tiny back then so this was a\r\ntruly stupendous amount of stuff: games, music, scans of ladies from the Sports\r\nIllustrated swimsuit issue, audio files of movie one-liners. I spent a lot of\r\ntime going through them, and they felt effectively infinite -- I would never,\r\never have enough time to play every game on those disks. Living in the content\r\ndesert of the early 90s, it was a miraculous content oasis, a prelude to the\r\ncontent ocean that we\'re all drowning in now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT was one of those games. I remember thinking it looked like a ripoff of\r\nKroz, but of course it turned out to be quite different. I loved exploring those\r\nworlds, and looking back on it, maybe I was taken with the abstractness of them,\r\nhow you could convey a sense of place with a sketching comprised of a few\r\nglyphs. Later exploration-driven indie games like <a href=\"http://www.autofish.net/clysm/art/video_games/seiklus/\" target=\"_blank\">Seiklus</a> and more recently\r\n<a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/509160/\" target=\"_blank\">Gebub\'s Adventure</a> feel to me like ZZT did, but with graphics -- exploring a\r\nworld where the art evoking the sense of place feels sketched in, rather than\r\nfully realized.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/jim-crawford-interview/seiklus.png\'%}\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/jim-crawford-interview/seiklus.png\'%}\" alt=\"Sulkies spelled backwards\" style=\"max-width:320px\">\r\n</a>\r\n<figcaption>Fellow ZZTer Clysm\'s Seiklus</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Another memory I have is coming across a ZZT developer group on Prodigy,\r\nwithout realizing what I\'d hit on. I don\'t think I ever actually posted\r\nanything, but Alexis Janson was posting there, who made a lot of the ZZT games\r\nI later came to love, and also <a href=\"http://digitalmzx.net\" target=\"_blank\">MegaZeux</a> and specifically <a href=\"http://vault.digitalmzx.net/show.php?id=94\" target=\"_blank\">Weirdness</a> -- a game\r\nthat, looking back on it, hits a lot of the same notes that I was trying for\r\nwith Frog Fractions.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/jim-crawford-interview/weirdness.png\'%}\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/jim-crawford-interview/weirdness.png\'%}\" alt=\"weirdness\" style=\"max-width:320px\">\r\n</a>\r\n<figcaption>Alexis Janson\'s Weirdness</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What ZZT games did you make? Are any of them around still on zzt.org?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I made a few ZZT games but I don\'t think I ever actually *released* any.\r\nWhen Frog Fractions was released I told people I\'d been making games for twenty\r\nyears, but that\'s overselling it -- what I\'d mostly been making was game\r\n*engines*, and when it came to actually making the content, I would peter out\r\nand rarely actually release anything. It was only with the development of Frog\r\nFractions 2 that I really forced myself to see if I could do for-real level\r\ndesign.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What inspired you to put an homage to ZZT in Frog Fractions 2?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I made Frog Fractions for my friends, so when 10000 people played it on day\r\none, I was pretty shocked. I wasn\'t part of the indie scene at the time; Frog\r\nFractions was very much \"outsider art.\" And I love outsider art! But six months\r\nafter its release, I was friends with tons of indie devs, and very much an\r\ninsider. I used that a ton, in leveraging talent to help make the game better,\r\nand help make the ARG better, but it also made me wonder about whether I was\r\ncapable of making something so weird and obscure any more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether or not it was actually necessary, I ended up compensating by making\r\nmy references even more obscure, including ZZT, Insanity and Nethack, three old\r\ngames that I discovered on those CD-ROMs that are almost unknown to modern\r\naudiences. Obscure allusions are a double edged sword; they\'re more powerful\r\nfor people who get them, but for people who don\'t, they just seem like nonsense.\r\nIn which case the trick is to make the nonsense itself worth seeing, in the case\r\nof a game like this one, making it funny or fun. I hope I succeeded!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After making FF1, I saw a lot of people have fun with the text adventure part\r\nand realize that was a kind of game they could enjoy playing. I kept that in\r\nmind deliberately for FF2, including a list of game recommendations for people\r\nwho 100% the game. I don\'t know how many people who love FF2 will love ZZT as\r\nwell, but anyone interested in spending that much time in TXT World probably at\r\nleast ought to give it a shot.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/536890/\" target=\"_blank\">Frog Fractions 2 can be purchased on Steam, under the title Glittermitten Grove</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    This interview is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of \r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2016-12-31',1,'django',1,NULL,'',''),(202,'Closer Look: Frost 1; Power','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get Frost 1; Power?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Frost 1; Power is available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=frost1.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_frost1\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>.\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also explore the world yourself on the\r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/f/frost1.zip?file=FROST1.ZZT&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT Public Beta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n<h2>Frost 1; Power</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Zenith Nadir<br>\r\n<!--Published Under: <br>-->\r\nReleased: Aug. 26th, 2003\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The year is 2003 and ZZT\'s sun is setting. It was the last year with more\r\nthan 100 released titles, and new members within the community were becoming\r\nless and less common. Despite being the beginning of the end, there were still\r\nquality games being released. Frost stands out as one of the most notable titles\r\nfrom ZZT\'s later years, holding up today as a game that offers unparalleled\r\ngraphics and attention to detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nadir\'s Frost was held in high regards after it\'s release. Already a well\r\nestablished ZZTer and popular community member, Frost became a ZZT must-play\r\novernight and has had a significant impact on the late ZZT community in several\r\nways. The game\'s graphics are some of the best you\'ll see in ZZT, and I\'ve often\r\nused screenshots from it as a way to illustrate the magnitude of difference\r\nbetween early ZZT games and modern ones. At least one ZZTer began constantly\r\nmessaging Nadir asking about his \"graphical secrets\" much to his chagrin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s a very iconic ZZT game as we\'ll shortly see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the game begins, you should take a listen to the game\'s theme-song,\r\ncomposed by MadTom, a very talented ZZT musician.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/575sRNvKPWw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_001.png\'%}\" alt=\"001\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_002.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_003.png\'%}\" alt=\"003\">\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}\r\nSET: ...It failed.

There is far more to read than there is\r\nto interact with, so be prepared for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frost opens with a cutscene of a gray figure falling from the sky, screaming.\r\nHis name is Set, he is not happy with where and when he is, but he is prepared\r\nto make the best of it and destroy some folks for reasons currently unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set will never make another appearance in this game again FYI.

Like uh rabbits\r\nand cats and foxes and lizards and\r\nhamsters and penguins and the odd dragon\r\netc. Not all species are intelligent in\r\nthis way, of course- think of it in terms\r\nof a planetary elite of animals or\r\nsomething, like how humans are really just\r\nsmart apes.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of one of them! Isn\'t\r\nthat exciting!!!\r\n\r\nWell, actually it\'s the story of several,\r\nbut in this one file I\'m going to\r\nconcentrate on a girl called Penny. She\r\ncomes from the continent on the right on\r\nthe lovely picture currently concealed\r\nbehind this stupid blue box thing. I\'ll\r\neven put a dot on the globe so you can see\r\nher approximate position because I\'m so\r\nnice.\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>And there\'s the rub. Welcome to Zootopia. Frost is a game that features a\r\ncast entirely of anthropomorphic animals. ZZT\'s limited graphics make it so that\r\nyou\'re not really getting anything out of being told the white on blue smiley\r\nface the player controls is a fox. The world of Frost wasn\'t designed\r\nspecifically for the medium of ZZT, so outside of art boards there\'s no real\r\ndifference in the characters being anthropomorphic or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_010.png\'%}\" alt=\"010\">\r\n\r\n<p>Again we\'re dealing with something made in 2003. So we get a good look at\r\nattitudes towards furries as well. In short, the prevailing wisdom of the time\r\nwas: they\'re bad and gross. I obviously can\'t speak for Nadir\'s thoughts on\r\nhimself, his work, and the furry fandom for the time, but the quick\r\nattempt to distance Frost from furry come off as being afraid of being marked\r\nwith the label. Frost wants its audience to enjoy it on its own merits, not\r\nbecause it has foxes in it. At the time, \"furries like this\" was a mark against\r\nsomething for a lot of people, and trying to push away that audience to better\r\ncourt others wasn\'t all that uncommon.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_014.png\'%}\" alt=\"014\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_015.png\'%}\" alt=\"015\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_013.png\'%}\" alt=\"013\">\r\n\r\n<p>Here we get a good look at our protagonist, Penny Shaïwell, and wow. It is\r\nincredibly difficult to portray people in ZZT, and frankly prior to my first\r\nplaying this game, I would\'ve thought a decent animal person would be beyond\r\nwhat ZZT could do. For ZZT, this is an incredibly complex pose! Again, these\r\ncharacters weren\'t created with ZZT in mind, but Nadir doesn\'t look to have made\r\nsacrifices for the sake of ZZT. Just the fact that she\'s been crammed head to\r\ntoe in a 25 tile high screen is accomplishment enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_016.png\'%}\" alt=\"016\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_019.png\'%}\" alt=\"019\">\r\n\r\n<p>Frost is packed with little details to bring the world to life. This cutscene\r\nconsists solely of Penny talking with her friend Melissa, and could have been\r\nvery rigid. Instead, other objects walk into the school, and an object on the\r\nbasketball court is animated repeatedly practicing their shots.</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}\r\nPENNY: Hm? Oh, hey Mel. Nothing much, I\r\n\r\nPENNY: was just digging around my room\r\n\r\nPENNY: last night and I found a pile of\r\n\r\nPENNY: old Speeduck comic books under my\r\n\r\nPENNY: bed... so I brought a couple with\r\n\r\nPENNY: me to read today...\r\n\r\nMELISSA: Cool, can I see?

I\'m fine.\r\n\r\nPENNY: Well, it\'s alright for some, I\r\n\r\nPENNY: suppose...\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>Melissa likes sword fighting and comics. We have no idea what species she is\r\nthough. (An <a href=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_300.png\' %}\" target=\"_blank\">unused art board</a> reveals her as a dog.) The bell rings (actually,\r\nvia #play sound effects), and the two rush off for class.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_022.png\'%}\" alt=\"022\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_021.png\'%}\" alt=\"021\">\r\n\r\n<p>The world is built up, but unlike most ZZT games which have to rely on\r\ntelling you, Frost is capable of showing as well. Negative space is used to\r\ncreate a nice mountain range in the background. It\'s a very pretty game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_024.png\'%}\" alt=\"024\">\r\n\r\n<p>This is the first bit of player interaction the game gives. Ms. Feris calls\r\nout a move at random, and the player has to press the appropriate direction to\r\nperform the action. Each move has the class perform the action, slashing\r\nvertically, parrying downward, of thrusting their swords forward. The timing is\r\ngenerous enough (though if you struggle the sequence starts over), and it\'s\r\npretty satisfying when you time it perfectly so that your sword stays in sync\r\nwith all the other students\' swords.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_033.png\'%}\" alt=\"033\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_034.png\'%}\" alt=\"034\">\r\n\r\n<p>After the refresher lesson, the class breaks into pairs. Melissa\'s annoyance\r\nkind of goes against her talking up how she actually enjoyed swordfighting in\r\nthe previous scene. It may have been more true to what\'s been established about\r\nthe characters to swap the dialog.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_036.png\'%}\" alt=\"036\">\r\n\r\n<p>The students are paired up in the next scene, and a helpful arrow points out\r\nMelissa and Penny among the crowd.

The house on the left appears to have ivy growing on it, a\r\ndetail that\'s completely unnecessary but shows the amount of effort that was put\r\ninto making these scenes look at good as they do. Speaking of detail, the brown\r\nclubs on the left are named \"garden lemur gnome things\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Penny and Melissa promptly appear and begin walking down the street. They\r\ndon\'t just walk, they walk _diagonally_, which is a pretty big deal for ZZT\r\nwhich has no concept of diagonal movement!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without using the trick for diagonal movement, given the perspective on this\r\nboard, the objects would be walking at a funny angle down the sidewalk, or have\r\nto zig-zag their way down, alternating between moving east and south. So how\r\ndoes it work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT\'s movement is typically handled with <code>/[dir]</code>. This\r\nmakes an object move once per active cycle. Tim Sweeney was kind enough to\r\nrealize that long repetitive lines like <code>/e/e/e/e/e/e/e/e/e/e</code> are a\r\nbit clunky for extended movement, and added a <code>#walk [dir]</code> command\r\nas well. When an object is walking, they will move in that direction every\r\nactive cycle until they are told to stop walking. (They can also jump to a\r\n<code>:thud</code> label when they hit a wall.) Unlike regular movement, walking\r\ndoesn\'t end a cycle and ZZT-OOP code is still processed, which includes a\r\nregular movement command. By walking south, and also moving east, the end result\r\nis that the object can take two steps in a single cycle! Note that it\'s two\r\nsteps and not a single diagonal step. The object can\'t be blocked to the south\r\nand the east, and then move diagonally southeast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This technique never got used all that often, so it does stand out here. It\r\ncan also be used with the same direction for walking and regular movement to\r\nmove in a cardinal direction at speeds faster than anything else in ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}\r\nMELISSA: So why aren\'t you out of your\r\n\r\nMELISSA: PE kit?\r\n\r\nPENNY: I can shower and change when I get\r\n\r\nPENNY: home.

The latter is cause for exile-\r\na traditional punishment, still in force\r\n200 or so years after the Rush\'tici War,\r\nduring which time Gian declared neutrality\r\nand banned all use of offensive magic of\r\nany form in its area, and offenders were\r\nthrown out of the country into Southern\r\nVasqueth. Not many people really live\r\nthere other than the exiles themselves\r\nand it\'s mostly forest, so nobody\r\ncomplained.

I\'d do the\r\nsame, but I still think she was totally\r\noverreacting about the sword thing.

It was the height of comedy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t know what Nadir was thinking when he decided to include this\r\nsequence, but it\'s honestly a completely understandable request! You\'re getting\r\nkicked out of the country, and have to begin a long walk to another city\r\nelsewhere, you darn well better have tampons if you need them. I feel like most\r\nmodern games would still be afraid to bring up any mention of periods, lest the\r\nillusion of women as pure creatures who definitely don\'t have bodily functions\r\nbe shattered.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_135.png\'%}\" alt=\"135\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_136.png\'%}\" alt=\"136\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_137.png\'%}\" alt=\"137\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_138.png\'%}\" alt=\"138\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_140.png\'%}\" alt=\"140\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_143.png\'%}\" alt=\"143\">\r\n\r\n<p>Goodbyes mostly said, Penny is now entirely on her own, as ready as she\'ll\r\never be to make her way to Alsace.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_144.png\'%}\" alt=\"144\">','','2017-01-09',1,'django',1,NULL,'articles/cl/frost-1-power/preview.png','ZZT\'s best looking game is also it\'s furriest.'),(203,'Closer Look: Frost 1; Power','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_146.png\'%}\" alt=\"146\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_147.png\'%}\" alt=\"147\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_145.png\'%}\" alt=\"145\">\r\n\r\n<p>After many, many cutscenes, the game finally begins in earnest.

Nadir does a nice job conveying a\r\nforest here, with the roughly circular shapes of all the different trees.\r\nCompare it to something like\r\n<a href=\"https://pokyfriends.com/static/blog/posts/11/zzt_030.png\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nDeceiving Guidance\'s forest\r\n</a> which tries to draw every individual tree and ends up being much muddier\r\nversus the distinct floors and walls of Frost\'s forest.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_151.png\'%}\" alt=\"151\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_152.png\'%}\" alt=\"152\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_154.png\'%}\" alt=\"154\">\r\n\r\n<p>The main gameplay of Frost consists of running into creatures to attack them\r\nwith your sword, while the creatures attempt to run into you and attack before\r\nyou can. It\'s fortunate that the game\'s graphics and storyline bring the game up\r\nso high, since the combat is pretty bad. The enemies react fast enough that it\'s\r\ndifficult to run into them directly, and just being adjacent for a moment is\r\nenough to take 5 damage. The creatures take two hits, and are knocked back from\r\nthe first hit so if you can\'t get them against a wall, they\'ll get away and\r\nbegin the process anew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that blood is from each time I was bit. To be fair to Nadir, this combat\r\nwould likely go much more smoothly outside of Dosbox where it\'s possible to run\r\nin a straight line and turn on a dime. The emulator\'s key repeat issues with ZZT\r\nmake things harder than they should be.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_158.png\'%}\" alt=\"158\">\r\n\r\n<p>Sandwiches are provided in the chest as a source of healing, under the\r\ncircumstances, it\'s not really enough. To make matters worse, there are hidden\r\nduplicators that create more enemies, so it\'s not actually possible to clear out\r\nan entire board.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_161.png\'%}\" alt=\"161\">\r\n\r\n<p>Up ahead is a bridge that\'s been blocked by a giant rock creature. The stream\r\nhere is animated to create the effect of flowing water, and there are also\r\nplenty of stones and bits of moss on the ground, adding some more detail to the\r\nforest than just having trees. The sprinkling of decorative objects again\r\ncontributes to making these environments feel less sterile.</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}@Stumpy\r\nPENNY: Great, the bridge is blocked by\r\nthis weird rock thing.\r\n\r\n(The weird rock thing emits a low roaring\r\nsound. Penny jumps back, alarmed.)\r\n\r\nPENNY: Yaah!! What the hell?\r\n\r\n(Upon closer inspection, Penny notes that\r\nthe `rock\' has eyes, a mouth and a greyish\r\nhide. The thing has a long, bleeding gash\r\nup on its shoulder. It\'s obviously\r\ninjured.)\r\n\r\nPENNY: Erm... (approaches nervously- the\r\ncreature attempts to move, but is too\r\nweak) Hang on, I know what you are. You\'re\r\none of those, things, whatsisnames...\r\nRogons, aren\'t you? (the creature appears\r\ndocile, and Penny comes up close to it and\r\nstrokes its nose. It seems pleased.)\r\n\r\nPENNY: Aw, who did that to you... hang on,\r\nyou\'re lucky my dad gave me some bandages\r\nand such this morning.\r\n\r\n(After a few minutes of poking around with\r\nher first aid kit, Penny successfully\r\npatches up the wound- but the rogon is\r\nstill too weak to move, like she\'d perhaps\r\nhoped.)\r\n\r\nPENNY: There we go. I wonder what caused\r\nthat- those nasty little polliwog things\r\ncouldn\'t have, they\'re not big enough. It\r\nmust have been another traveller maybe, or\r\na brigand... Uh, could you do me a favour\r\nand like move already? I\'ve got a mountain\r\nto pass over and I\'d like to get there\r\nbefore it sunset. What time is it now...\r\n11:34am. Actually, I\'m in no rush. But\r\nstill! SHIFT YO ASS\r\n\r\n(Impasse. The rogon remains inert.)\r\n\r\nPENNY: I said move!!\r\n\r\n(Penny attempts to push it out of the way,\r\nto no avail. The rogon makes a low\r\nwhining sound.)\r\n\r\nPENNY: Well, this is going nowhere fast.\r\nI can\'t get by or over this thing, and\r\nthe stream is too fast flowing to cross.\r\nWhat do you want?!\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nFor the love of Fauna... hmm. If I\r\nrecall my Biology correctly, aren\'t rogan\r\nnative to swampy areas? And didn\'t I pass\r\nby a swamp about half a mile back? Hm.\r\n\r\n(The rogon blinks significantly upon\r\nmention of a swamp, and makes a gentle\r\ngrunting sound. Penny notices something\r\nshiny in the grass for the first time.)\r\n\r\nPENNY: Hang on, what\'s this?\r\n\r\n(She goes to pick it up. It\'s a name tag.\r\nDon\'t ask me where it\'s supposed to hang\r\nfrom on a creature with no immediately\r\napparent neck.)\r\n\r\n$Hello!

Penny\'s dismissal of the swamp being\r\nhaunted would imply to me that this is a world without ghosts and skeletons as\r\nthings people believe are real. Her reaction to seeing undead in a world that\r\nshouldn\'t have any is pretty calm. Maybe Ilititoa does have these things, and\r\nPenny just disregards them since she was raised in a magic-free environment\r\nwhere such things were essentially non-existent.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_185.png\'%}\" alt=\"185\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_186.png\'%}\" alt=\"186\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_188.png\'%}\" alt=\"188\">\r\n\r\n<p>Or maybe the reality of the situation doesn\'t hit her until just now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This next screen introduces zombies and bloodflies, both of which are easier\r\nto deal with the the polliwogs from earlier. The zombies will move straight\r\ntowards the player once they\'re aligned with them, which makes it a lot easier\r\nto run straight into them without having the enemy move away during the\r\napproach. The bloodflies have similar behavior, and also are defeated in a\r\nsingle hit. Since both creatures mostly try to move towards the player, it\'s\r\neasy to get them stuck against a wall which makes avoiding them an option.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_191.png\'%}\" alt=\"191\">\r\n\r\n<p>Like before, signs guide the player where to go, and like before the player\r\nwill find the obvious direction blocked, and have to take the \"wrong\" path in\r\norder to proceed.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/frost-1-power/zzt_193.png\'%}\" alt=\"193\">\r\n\r\n<p>Heading to the house, once more the tiny details make the most out of the\r\nscene.

I don\'t\r\nimagine you\'d get much traffic in a place\r\ncalled \"Haunted Swamp\".\r\n\r\nHENNA: Yeah, but this place was just\r\nlabeled such by Silver to keep people out.\r\nBut then it started living up to its name,\r\nas you know...\r\n\r\nPENNY: Silver? Your mentor, right?\r\n\r\nHENNA: Sorry, yes.\r\n\r\nPENNY: ...so none of this is your\r\ndoing, other than the signs? I had this\r\nmental image of you watching me from your\r\nbubbling cauldron, waiting for the moment\r\nat which you\'d release the flying monkeys.\r\n\r\nHENNA: Don\'t be disgusting. And aye,\r\npretty much. And that\'s why I was on my\r\nway out... you see, Silver... got killed\r\nby zombies just hours ago... we were both\r\nin the thick when the dead started rising,\r\nshe was showing me how to strengthen\r\nforcefields... and before we knew we were\r\nsurrounded... and god fuck I just don\'t\r\nwant to talk about it right now.\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>Penny awakens in the house she saw earlier, with Henna taking care of her\r\ninjuries.

I was going to just\r\nrun back here, get what I could and then\r\nscarper, but then you came into the\r\npicture.

Plus there\'s the\r\ngate. We\'re safe.\r\n\r\nPENNY: If you say so, but I\'m not waiting\r\nto find out.

I can worry about\r\nthat later. Why don\'t you come with me?\r\nI mean, those horrible skeletons I met on\r\nmy way in could use a few hits of that\r\nfire beam thing I saw you use earlier.\r\n\r\nHENNA: Skeletons?\r\n\r\nPENNY: You don\'t know?

She was hurt and blocking a bridge I\r\nneeded to cross and I couldn\'t find any\r\nother way over. I fixed her up, but she\r\nwouldn\'t shift- I saw your name on her\r\ncollar, so I thought I\'d come look for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nHENNA: (pacing) Oh my, this is terrible...\r\nwe have to find her.

Alas, the sequel was never\r\ncompleted, though an incomplete version was released by Nadir in 2007 with\r\nauthor commentary sprinkled throughout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was also a period where Nadir tried his hand at telling the Frost story\r\nvia a webcomic. The comic has about 30 pages, covers everything shown here up to\r\nPenny arriving in the woods, and cleans up the writing enough that going from\r\nthe comic to the ZZT game, there\'s a noticeable difference. It\'ll be posted on\r\nthe Museum beta site (both public and private) later this month, so be sure to\r\ncheck that out!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This game extremely captivating. Its world is clearly one that was thought\r\nout and whose surface was barely scratched in the first game. I keep repeating\r\nmyself, but the game\'s graphics, both in the dedicated art boards as well as\r\nthose with player control are without a doubt some of the best seen in ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The writing is pretty solid. Nadir seems a bit afraid of creating a dead\r\nserious world and the writing definitely imparts a bit of lightheartedness even\r\nwhen the situations can be pretty grim. Penny\'s reactions can be a bit\r\nunderwhelming, but overall there\'s nothing eyerolling here. Some plot threads\r\naren\'t really explored, like the whole Set character, and the exact mixture of\r\nfantasy/sci-fi/reality that\'s blended together isn\'t really defined. It\'s a bit\r\nlike the blend of magic and technology you\'d see out of a Final Fantasy game,\r\nbut the world isn\'t really developed to the point where you could confidently\r\nguess whether something like computers or guns exist. Exactly what can and can\'t\r\nbe done with magic isn\'t explored either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such criticisms about the unknowns of the world would likely not apply\r\nhad the series been completed of course. Frost includes the \"1\" in its own\r\ntitle. Of course the first chapter wouldn\'t have all the answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the gameplay, it feels a bit tacked on. I\'m not surprised Nadir later\r\ntried to tell the story through comics, since it seems like a better fit. The\r\ncombat seems to be there for the sake of having more traditional ZZT gameplay,\r\nand not just calling the ZZT world a cinema. Playing under Dosbox, you\'ll\r\nprobably need to cheat for health, but while it\'s a bit harsh on the player,\r\nit\'s not the sort of thing that makes you wonder how it was supposed to be\r\nenjoyable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s a shame the series was never completed, but even the brief foray into\r\nthe world of Ilititoa offered by Frost 1; Power is a trip worth taking.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of\r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2017-01-09',1,'django',2,202,'',''),(204,'Closer Look: Aceland','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get Aceland?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Aceland is available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=aceland.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_aceland\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>.\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also explore the world yourself on the\r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/a/aceland.zip?file=ACELAND.ZZT&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT Public Beta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_002.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n<h2>Aceland</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Prakish (Ace) Padole<br>\r\n<!--Published Under: <br>-->\r\nReleased: Jul. 4, 1994\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s very difficult to say what a ZZT game is. There are so many of them\r\nreleased over 25 years covering dozens of genres, aesthetics, and ways to play.\r\nYet somehow amongst all the chaos, there are some games that just capture the\r\nessence of ZZT, and Aceland is a shining example of this. It\'s a bright\r\ngrand adventure through forests, caves, and castles, but it\'s not a fantasy\r\nthemed world. It has oddities and eccentricities, and just creates a mixture of\r\nideas in that way that only ZZT can. Prak\'s Aceland is an iconic ZZT adventure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_002.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n\r\n<p>Aceland has a very peculiar title screen. There\'s a blue and green blob which\r\nmight be the world the game takes place on? It\'s being shot by spinning guns?\r\nThere\'s a yellow object shooting from the opposite side.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_004.png\'%}\" alt=\"004\">\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually the yellow object will shoot and reveal this number eight that\r\nstarts shooting back? I have no idea what any of this means.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_006.png\'%}\" alt=\"006\">\r\n\r\n<p>The starting board isn\'t any more traditional. An object pushes you up\r\ntowards the passage. The other half of the room is a bonus object that can\'t be\r\ngotten for quite some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_007.png\'%}\" alt=\"007\">\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the game itself starts. A small street with a few homes, all very\r\nclearly labeled for the player. The pool warns of sharks, and sure enough there\r\nare a few there. It\'s just a silly addition, and completely avoidable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bad neighbor can be seen shooting bullets randomly, living up to his\r\nname.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_008.png\'%}\" alt=\"008\">\r\n\r\n<p>Your roommate is standing outside your home, and gives you some starting\r\nmotivation, but doesn\'t really tell you all that much. It won\'t take long before\r\nthe game\'s plot is actually revealed to the player though.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_011.png\'%}\" alt=\"011\">\r\n\r\n<p>The first place to check out is your house. As far as homes in ZZT go, this\r\none is pretty lacking in the realism department. No bed, couch, oven, or even a\r\ntoilet to be found. Just rooms containing some supplies to get the player\r\nup and running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scroll is a message from the author, who refers to himself as Prak,\r\ntelling the player that they\'ll die in Aceland.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_013.png\'%}\" alt=\"013\">\r\n\r\n<p>With some ammo now, the player is likely to try shooting their neighbor, only\r\nto find it has no effect on him.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_017.png\'%}\" alt=\"017\">\r\n\r\n<p>The gardener expresses dissatisfaction at working for such a jerk. The cyan\r\nclub is a tree with a gem on it that the player takes, which also causes the\r\ntree object to vanish. Other than that, there\'s nothing else the player can do\r\non this board for now, since both the other homes are locked.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_019.png\'%}\" alt=\"019\">\r\n\r\n<p>The city in Aceland is this single board. There\'s a lone object wandering the\r\nstreets who will greet the player when touched, and also a single tiger for some\r\nreason.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_020.png\'%}\" alt=\"020\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_021.png\'%}\" alt=\"021\">\r\n\r\n<p>The sign in the middle of the road gives the player the game\'s plot. They\'ll\r\nneed to collect some keys (that aren\'t purple!) and defeat Mugerlock, who I\r\nguess must be evil. To do this, the player will need a microwave oven, the one\r\nthing that can kill a sorcerer. Don\'t question it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that all established, it\'s time to explore Trala.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_023.png\'%}\" alt=\"023\">\r\n\r\n<p>The store consists of a regular shopkeeper who sells ammo and torches, and\r\nTricia the great, a friendly magic user who beckons the player as soon as they\r\nenter the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_024.png\'%}\" alt=\"024\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_025.png\'%}\" alt=\"025\">\r\n\r\n<p>For 5 gems, Tricia will transform the enemies on the board into ammo, which\r\ncompared to the shopkeeper\'s prices is a very good deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_026.png\'%}\" alt=\"026\">\r\n\r\n<p>The shopkeeper sells the usual items, and no healing. The player is given\r\nsome interesting choices for how to respond to somebody who is talking about\r\nbeans and pork. Aceland is a weird game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_028.png\'%}\" alt=\"028\">\r\n\r\n<p>Next up is the museum, which is an interesting thing to include in an\r\nunofficial ZZT world. This board explains what the default ZZT enemies do, and\r\nI can\'t imagine how few people (especially in 1994) played a fan ZZT game\r\nbefore playing Town and Demo where they\'d learn all about these creatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a \"Torture room\".</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_032.png\'%}\" alt=\"032\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_033.png\'%}\" alt=\"033\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_034.png\'%}\" alt=\"034\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_035.png\'%}\" alt=\"035\">\r\n\r\n<p>Even in 1994 people were questioning why tigers can shoot bullets.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_036.png\'%}\" alt=\"036\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_037.png\'%}\" alt=\"037\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_038.png\'%}\" alt=\"038\">\r\n\r\n<p>Also take note that there are still centipedes in the tiger cage. This board\r\nfeatures some overlapping stats that happen with ZZT sometimes, and as the\r\ntigers move around, centipedes will begin to appear.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_039.png\'%}\" alt=\"039\">\r\n\r\n<p>Pushers being classified as creatures is a bit of an odd decision, but it\r\ndoes have some precedent since they\'re listed under the creatures menu and not\r\nterrain in ZZT\'s editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_040.png\'%}\" alt=\"040\">\r\n\r\n<p>The back of the museum shows off more of ZZT\'s features, conveyors that move\r\nthings along, invisible walls (which are annoying), fake walls, blink walls,\r\nbreakable walls, bombs, duplicators, and energizers! It is a pretty decent\r\noverview for two screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_046.png\'%}\" alt=\"046\">\r\n\r\n<p>Although the game suggest the museum for beginners, it\'s actually necessary\r\nin order to talk to your neighbor\'s wife. She gives you the key to her house to\r\nmake up for him being such an awful neighbor!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"054\">\r\n\r\n<p>With a key, rather than explore the remaining areas of the city, I head\r\nstraight to the neighbor\'s house.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_055.png\'%}\" alt=\"055\">\r\n\r\n<p>The neighbor\'s house is structured similarly to your own, only considerably\r\nmore deadly. The green boulders that make up the background repeatedly flash\r\ncolors which really make this board pop out visually in action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objective here is the cyan key which lets the player into the basement.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_058.png\'%}\" alt=\"058\">\r\n\r\n<p>The basement is dark, but I\'m showing it lit up here. The key gives the\r\nplayer more supplies, and a red key which can open the gardener\'s house as well\r\nas the supply room in the shop. Unfortunately I have the memory of the goldfish\r\nand did not get all the goodies in the shop with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a secret passage to the south to a world map. Passages show up in\r\ndark boards so the fake walls of the basement and hidden world map aren\'t really\r\nmuch of a secret, but I\'m unsure still if it was meant as a reward for a player\r\nor a debug room.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_063.png\'%}\" alt=\"063\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_065.png\'%}\" alt=\"065\">\r\n\r\n<p>The world map consists of two screens, and can take the player to essentially\r\nevery board in the game, and even marks boards that are dark with torches.\r\nSeeing as how it\'s possible to warp to one board away from the game\'s end, I\r\nopted to just pretend like I had never found it and move on to the gardener\'s\r\nhouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_068.png\'%}\" alt=\"068\">\r\n\r\n<p>This is another weird board. The gardener is a big fan of trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_071.png\'%}\" alt=\"071\">\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, seeing a notice to not shoot the gardener\'s trees, I immediately\r\ndo so, which causes it to fall down. Though there\'s nothing that happens for\r\ndoing so, even if you shoot away ever single tree like I did. It\'s not being an\r\nawful person, it\'s a social experiment to see what will happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a white key to pick up here. It\'s not a regular ZZT key, but an\r\nobject. This is one of the keys that is needed to get in the tower of Pzia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The museum quest is now completed in its entirety, and I can get back to\r\nexploring the rest of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_074.png\'%}\" alt=\"074\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_075.png\'%}\" alt=\"075\">\r\n\r\n<p>Banking in the 90s was a terrible experience from what I gather.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_078.png\'%}\" alt=\"078\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a fake wall that lets the player get right to the tellers, but none\r\nof them will have anything to do with the player. Invisible walls prevent the\r\nplayer from entering the passage or attempting to unlock the vault.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_083.png\'%}\" alt=\"083\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_084.png\'%}\" alt=\"084\">\r\n\r\n<p>You can\'t cut in line, but you can kill this person to get into the passage.\r\nIn Aceland, the player\'s not so much a hero as they are a person who never has\r\nto suffer any consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_087.png\'%}\" alt=\"087\">\r\n\r\n<p>The bank\'s basement is a normally dark room, filled with various creatures,\r\nkeys, and multiple exits.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_088.png\'%}\" alt=\"088\">\r\n\r\n<p>The scroll blatantly hints at which passage to try to get to, with the others\r\nleading to sections of the bank that are dead ends. There\'s not a lot to say\r\nabout the combat here. It\'s just a few enemies scattered about in darkness.\r\nNothing too difficult given how little the player can see. The board is\r\nplenty fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_095.png\'%}\" alt=\"095\">\r\n\r\n<p>The correct exit leads to a rather tiny invisible maze, hence the message\r\nabout having fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_098.png\'%}\" alt=\"098\">\r\n\r\n<p>The transporter leads to the back of the vault, where there\'s a second white\r\nkey to the tower, as well as a \"disintergrater\" which causes the green objects\r\nwaiting in line to all be destroyed. From here the player needs to backtrack to\r\nexit the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big red section of the bank is actually a maze made out of fake walls\r\nwhich can be used to gain access to the vault and collect as many gems as the\r\nplayer is willing to wait for to be duplicated into the vault. Aceland does a\r\npretty solid job at giving the player ample resources, so it\'s not really\r\nnecessary, but it does mean a source of infinite healing, and the gems can be\r\nspent on ammo and torches for an infinite number of them as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_112.png\'%}\" alt=\"112\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_113.png\'%}\" alt=\"113\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_115.png\'%}\" alt=\"115\">\r\n\r\n<p>The last building in the Trala is the church, where the player can exchange\r\ntheir score for health. I don\'t think high scores were ever really much of a\r\nfocus with ZZT, but I do like how maximizing your score involves avoiding\r\nhealing. Or at least it would, if not for infinite score and health giving gems\r\nin the bank vault.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_118.png\'%}\" alt=\"118\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_119.png\'%}\" alt=\"119\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_121.png\'%}\" alt=\"121\">\r\n\r\n<p>I headed west of the city to the tower gates, a dangerous board full of\r\nspinning guns that rain bullets down on the player with several creatures\r\nroaming the board as well. The white doors are here, and any keys that you\'ve\r\ncollected are consumed by just entering the board rather than touching the doors\r\nthemselves. Since the path is still blocked off, I turned around and headed in\r\nthe opposite direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_122.png\'%}\" alt=\"122\">\r\n\r\n<p>East of the city is the forest, which is broken up into a few different\r\nsegments, the first of which is a simple puzzle of lining up boulders to get\r\nthe pushers to open up the next section.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_126.png\'%}\" alt=\"126\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player will have to push some boulders off to the side as well in order\r\nto actually get enough clearance to go inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_127.png\'%}\" alt=\"127\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_130.png\'%}\" alt=\"130\">\r\n\r\n<p>The talking trees pretty much ignore the player, but if you bug them too many\r\ntimes...</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_136.png\'%}\" alt=\"136\">\r\n\r\n<p>They start shooting in all directions! So, please leave these trees alone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weird \"turn it off\" button can turn the pushers into gems, which is good\r\nsince it\'s easy to trap yourself in this area otherwise if you didn\'t push\r\nenough boulders out of the way to have an exit. I actually reloaded a save since\r\nI thought I had accidentally trapped myself and the button\'s purpose wasn\'t\r\nreadily apparent.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_141.png\'%}\" alt=\"141\">\r\n\r\n<p>The eastern path in the forest leads to even more forest.

After defeating the rest of the enemies it\'s safe to head north to\r\nthe \"Fortress of doom\" the sign helpfully guides the player to.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_145.png\'%}\" alt=\"145\">\r\n\r\n<p>I really enjoy how this board looks.

Meanwhile, in the dinner hall a\r\ncook serves everybody dinner, and gets fed up with their reactions and calls it\r\nquits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this is going on while the player is shooting at creatures and\r\ncollecting a red key to get into the castle\'s basement. Aceland has a lot of\r\nbasements now that I think about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_159.png\'%}\" alt=\"159\">\r\n\r\n<p>As you\'d expect, the basement is dark. This one has several passages, but is\r\nstructured very linearly.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_160.png\'%}\" alt=\"160\">\r\n\r\n<p>The passage takes the player to the hallway, which takes them to the basement\r\nagain, which takes them to the hallway, which takes them to the basement yet\r\nagain.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_162.png\'%}\" alt=\"162\">\r\n\r\n<p>From the bottom right corner of the basement it\'s possible to get into this\r\narea with the prison chase.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_163.png\'%}\" alt=\"163\">\r\n\r\n<p>The guard is not happy with us being there and starts shooting and following\r\nthe player around.

In order to get into\r\nthe mountain cave, the player has to defeat two tiger boss enemies that use the\r\nsame character ZZT uses for lions rather than tigers.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_198.png\'%}\" alt=\"198\">\r\n\r\n<p>\"You should stay away from the lions.

There\'s a dead end\r\npath with just a few gems, and a giant centipede that guards nothing and has to\r\nbe freed by the player. Of course, with the lights out the player likely won\'t\r\nsee enough to make realize these things until they\'re already gone down those\r\npaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_210.png\'%}\" alt=\"210\">\r\n\r\n<p>The upper path leads to a room that isn\'t dark, since it\'s a puzzle room.\r\nLike Town of ZZT\'s Rube Board, there are false hints to confuse the player, a\r\ntype of puzzle design I have some pretty negative feelings towards.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_211.png\'%}\" alt=\"211\">\r\n\r\n<p>Prak offers the player some sympathy though, with an object that can be used\r\nto skip the puzzle in exchange for losing out on gems and points.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_218.png\'%}\" alt=\"218\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_220.png\'%}\" alt=\"220\">\r\n\r\n<p>Getting through turns out to be pretty simple, the player just needs to block\r\nthe last pusher from closing the passage to the doors in the upper area. Then\r\nthere\'s the classic 3 boulder puzzle that shows up constantly in ZZT games.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_225.png\'%}\" alt=\"225\">\r\n\r\n<p>After that, the board becomes an action sequence, full of keys and creatures.\r\nThe one tile wide chokepoints are pretty silly with how trivial it is to avoid\r\ngetting hit by just firing well in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_226.png\'%}\" alt=\"226\">\r\n\r\n<p>The reward for finishing the room is health and points, along with a purple key\r\nand yet more supplies. Though I am dangerously low on torches by this point.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_237.png\'%}\" alt=\"237\">\r\n\r\n<p>With a fresh purple key, it\'s possible to venture into the eastern corridor\r\nof the caves. It\'s dark and full of lions and bears, and a single tiger! This\r\nboard looks very ugly to me, but you\'re normally seeing very little of it at\r\none time. Maybe it\'s just an association of yellow normal walls with ugliness\r\nfrom years of bad ZZT games that don\'t do anything with the default border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to cheating for the benefit of taking screenshots, I knew I could\r\nignore that middle pocket there which was a nice little bonus.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_240.png\'%}\" alt=\"240\">\r\n\r\n<p>The caves keep going, and it\'s pretty clear that I don\'t have enough torches.\r\nAceland loves to dump ammo and gems on the player, but torches are far more\r\nscarce. I decided rather than get stuck in the dark that I\'d turn back now and\r\ndo some shopping.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_242.png\'%}\" alt=\"242\">\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s a bit of a walk, but it\'s definitely needed. Aceland doesn\'t have forced\r\npurchases like The Lost Monkeys where the player can find themselves stuck, but\r\nusing the microwave does cost gems (usually, some objects seem to forget to\r\ncheck). Again, infinite gems in the vault so no issues here.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_244.png\'%}\" alt=\"244\">\r\n\r\n<p>The nice thing is I remembered that I could use the hidden world map to just\r\njump directly to the part of the caves I turned around in.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/aceland/zzt_247.png\'%}\" alt=\"247\">\r\n\r\n<p>Just like that, I\'m back on track in the M Caves.

As is often the case with ZZT\r\nenemies that shoot, they tend to shoot each other a good amount before the\r\nplayer can even get there.

It feels like the quintessential game where\r\nyou just do things for the sake of doing them. The story is barebones, with the\r\nplayer\'s sole motivation for defeating Mugerlock being that a sign in the middle\r\nof the road told them to. Everything in it feels so meaningless as if any\r\nquestioning on why the player is going somewhere or doing something is only\r\nanswered with a simple \"because\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, its opportunity to explore such a video game typical world ends up\r\nultimately being a lot of fun. Aceland is a very traditional ZZT game about\r\ngetting keys, shooting lions, and talking with NPCs who feel far more like props\r\nthan people. The same could be said of Town of ZZT really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where Aceland shines, is in its ability to somehow transfix the player\r\ndespite its inanities. Once the player gets that microwave oven and realizes\r\nthat nearly every object in the game will die to it, it becomes this absolutely\r\nbizarre game less about exploring environments and more about exploring\r\ninteractions. Who will live? Why? What will they say when they\'re fried? It\'s\r\nall very juvenile, but it makes the person playing want to see things through.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aceland is a game about being labeled a hero and escaping consequences\r\nbecause of it, and it does this without a hint of irony. The game never comments\r\non the player\'s actions. Mugerlock doesn\'t actually do anything, and there\'s no\r\nreason you can\'t just interpret the player themselves as being the antagonist.\r\nIt\'s a playground where the player gets to do whatever they like, whether that\r\nbe microwaving cats, freeing prisoners, or shooting evil wizards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a lot of fun playing through Aceland (though the caves dragged on a\r\nbit). It feels like a natural evolution of the formula provided in ZZT\'s\r\noriginal worlds, and is definitely one anybody who enjoys ZZT games needs to at\r\nleast give a try.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of\r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2017-01-23',1,'django',3,204,'',''),(207,'Closer Look: ZZTer Comics','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h1>ZZT and Comics</h1>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zzter-comics/zzzzt.jpg\'%}\" alt=\"zzzt\">\r\n<p>With any creative medium, once you\'ve tried one out, you\'re probably going to\r\nbe interested in trying out others.

This was a short lived\r\nseries written specifically to be posted on the ZZT Archives of the time. Two\r\ncharacters, one who never is named, and the other \"Vortek\", are ZZTers who spend\r\ntoo much time playing ZZT and being on the computer in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The humor is very basic. It\'s observational humor where the observation is\r\neither \"ZZT is outdated\" or \"ZZTers use ZZT a lot\", with a few \"a rectangular\r\nslab with a smiley face on it would look strange in the real world\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a whopping 10 strips, and it takes about 2 minutes to read\r\nall of them, so go on and do that!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/comic/nomad/\" target=\"_blank\">Nomad\'s ZZT Comics</a></b><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Yellow Boarders</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zzter-comics/kaddar.gif\'%}\" alt=\"Yellow Boarders\">\r\n\r\n<p>The second series of ZZT comics is \"Yellow Boarders\" created by Kaddar not\r\nlong after Nomad\'s comics ended. Much like Nomad\'s comics, Yellow Boarders had\r\na short run of only seven strips. It even repeats Nomad\'s \"Why are we playing\r\nan ASCII game on our Pentium 3 machines\" but this time in the era of Pentium 4s.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yellow Boarders is much more relevant to the ZZT community, with strips about\r\n24 Hours of ZZT contests, and hyping ZZT games still in development as being way\r\nmore advanced than the actually are. They\'re not exactly laugh out loud funny,\r\nbut you can at least tell there\'s a joke in each strip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still want the main character\'s ZZT player shirt to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/comic/kaddar\" target=\"_blank\">Kaddar\'s Yellow Boarders</a></b><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Bencomic</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zzter-comics/bencomic.png\'%}\" alt=\"Bencomic\">\r\n\r\n<p>Though Nomad and Kaddar\'s comics were short lived and quickly forgotten,\r\nBencomic, created by Benco and several others over the years, was a cornerstone\r\nof ZZT comics with an archive spanning over eight years! Unlike the previous\r\ncomics, Bencomic was not an original series, and was instead a comic conversion\r\nof various logs of ZZT IRC channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as ZZT community culture goes, Bencomic is a treasure trove today.\r\nCharacter representations are (mostly) consistent, and what few poses the\r\ncharacters have add a surprising amount towards making what\'s essential reading\r\n15 year old IRC logs palatable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bencomic wasn\'t drawn by any of the people producing the strip, instead\r\ntaking advantage of a site called Stripcreator, which lets you create 3 panel\r\ncomics by selecting backgrounds, characters, and poses to combine with your\r\ndialog. The characters featured are mostly from other webcomics from the early\r\n2000s including \"Penny Aracde\", \"Jerkcity\", \"Diesel Sweeties\", and even the\r\ncharacters seen in \"Yellow Boarders\"!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bencomic was split across two accounts, the first on the account Benco, and\r\nthe second more recent comics on the account Bencomic. The Benco account has\r\nyet to be properly preserved, but some automated screenshots of every Bencomic\r\naccount strip is on the museum thanks to the efforts of Zamros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"http://www.stripcreator.com/comics/benco\" target=\"_blank\">Bencomic</a> (Classic) on Stripcreator</b><br>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/comic/bencomic/\" target=\"_blank\">Bencomic</a> (Modern) on the Museum of ZZT</b><br>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"http://www.stripcreator.com/comics/bencomic\" target=\"_blank\">Bencomic</a> (Modern) on Stripcreator</b><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Mr. Shapiro</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zzter-comics/shapiro.gif\'%}\" alt=\"Mr. Shapiro\">\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Shapiro was a ZZT game series that began in 2000 by Eurakarte. The games\r\nfeatured triangular characters such as Mr. Shapiro, Ibo, and Triangy and also\r\nincluded a few MS Paint comic strips featuring the games\' characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are pretty blatantly inspired by Pokey the Penguin. <s style=\"font-family:monospace\">YES</s></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/comic/mr-shapiro/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Shapiro Comics</a></b><br>\r\n<b>Mr. Shapiro Cares Not For Lies - <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/m/shaplies.zip\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_shaplies\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a></b><br>\r\n<b>Mr. Shapiro Cares Not For Snakes - <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/m/shap-snk.zip\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_shap-snk\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a></b><br>\r\n<b>Year of Shapiro - <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/y/yearoshp.zip\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_yearoshp\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a></b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Zamros: The Comic</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zzter-comics/zamros.gif\'%}\" alt=\"Zamros: The Comic\">\r\n\r\n<p>Like Bencomic in being based on IRC logs, but Dave2\'s Zamros: The Comic is\r\ninstead illustrated with simple MS Paint artwork. Zamros is the star outright,\r\nas opposed to Bencomic where he often steals the show. There are a lot of good\r\nstories from Zamros, and it\'s no wonder why he got his very own comic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, here several of the comics feature stories from other ZZTers\r\nincluding John W. Wells, Skullie, and CraNKGod. Zamros: The Comic goes back to\r\nZZT comic standard of being short lived, with a modest 21 strips being produced.\r\nThe artwork is cheerful looking and does a nice job of presenting the stories\r\ntold within.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/comic/zamros/\" target=\"_blank\">Zamros: The Comic</a></b><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Lemmy</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zzter-comics/lemmy.jpg\'%}\" alt=\"Lemmy\">\r\n\r\n<p>Lemmy is the first comic featured which feels less like a ZZT community comic\r\nand more like a webcomic in general. Created by DarkMage, the series does\r\nfeature a few ZZTers within the cast, Lemmer and Skullie in particular, but\r\nboth of them are side characters. Instead, Lemmy focuses on Lemmer\'s sister,\r\nwho you may have guessed is named Lemmy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lemmy deals with the sort of plots you\'d expect from a mid 2000s webcomic,\r\nsatanic rituals, joining clubs in high school, and mastering Dance Dance\r\nRevolution. The strip\'s artwork is easily the highest quality of any of the\r\ncomics featured here. The characters are detailed, and several comics are\r\nproduced in color, with markers or colored pencils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also jokes about writing on Live Journal!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/comic/lemmy/\" target=\"_blank\">Lemmy</a></b><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Ol\' Uncle Bo\'s Gamblin\' Shack</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zzter-comics/ubgs.gif\'%}\" alt=\"UBGS\">\r\n\r\n<p>Ol\' Uncle Bo\'s Gamblin\' Shack (abbreviated as UBGS) was a long running\r\nstrip created with clip art and MS Paint, starring Bo, his friend Bread, and his\r\ntwo slaves Qu and Hank. It takes place in modern times, and this comic has aged\r\nabout as well as it sounds. It brought ZZTers the phrases \"Szplug\" and\r\n\"What a puhhdicament\" though? The comic (in its heyday) was of course a hit.\r\nThere\'s even a flash adaptation of one of the strips on\r\n<a href=\"http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/84366\" target=\"_blank\">Newgrounds</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/comic/ubgs/\" target=\"_blank\">Ol\' Uncle Bo\'s Gamblin\' Shack</a></b><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>The Prophesies of Revvy</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zzter-comics/revvy.gif\'%}\" alt=\"Revvy\">\r\n\r\n<p>While the other comics were all projects intending to keep going without any\r\nreal definitive end, Revvy\'s \"The Prophesies of Revvy\" was released all at\r\nonce without any intentions of there being more. It\'s a short, self-contained\r\nsurreal comic treating ZZT\'s data as something like a Bible code and using it to\r\ndocument ZZT\'s past, present, and future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now if only it didn\'t have any rape jokes and transphobic remarks, I\'d say\r\nit\'s well worth taking a look it. Instead, it turns into something that would\r\nbe a fun read, that\'s spoiled by a few jarring instances of the outdated \"humor\"\r\nof its time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Read <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/comic/revvy/\" target=\"_blank\">The Prophesies of Revvy</a></b><br>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Frost</h2>\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/zzter-comics/frost.png\'%}\" alt=\"Frost\">\r\n\r\n<p>The last comic archived is Zenith Nadir\'s \"Frost\", which ran sporadically\r\nfrom 2008-2009.

It\'s the only title released by Yapok Jr and had\r\nto have had some impact or legacy, or maybe it\'s just a fun name to say.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game was released in 1995, which seems to be right in the middle of a\r\nturning point for ZZT. Alexis Janson had released Super Tool Kit, giving ZZTers\r\nreasonable access to special colors, and so Sundria (let\'s just call the game\r\nSundria and the author Yapok to prevent confusion) benefits from nicer graphics\r\nthan early ZZT worlds. At the same time, ZZT\'s full graphical potential hadn\'t\r\nreally been realized, so you\'ll find trees with brown trunks, but no complex\r\nshading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gameplay is at a crossroads as well. The early days of Town knockoffs\r\nand generic fantasy being phased out for a more surreal and whimsical world with\r\noddball humor. Shooting lions and solving slider puzzles are giving way for a\r\ngame which tells a story with characters who are more than props to guide the\r\nplayer through puzzles. Sundria is an adventure game about exploring the world\r\nand seeing what strange creatures live in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_001.png\'%}\" alt=\"001\">\r\n\r\n<p>The title screen is just some blocky colors and flashing color line walls\r\ncovering the screen\'s edges. There\'s no insight as to what the game is about,\r\njust a title and who you\'ll be taking the role of while playing.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_002.png\'%}\" alt=\"002\">\r\n\r\n<p>Sundria begins with Louis\'s alarm clock in his tree home going off and\r\ngetting ready to start his day with some coffee. The player is immediately\r\npresented with a choice of which mug to drink from.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_005.png\'%}\" alt=\"005\">\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing wrong results in an additional message about drinking grease\r\ninstead, but with no penalty suffered as the other correct cup is drank\r\nimmediately afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_006.png\'%}\" alt=\"006\">\r\n\r\n<p>With the message window closed, the player gets a look at Louis\'s tree house\r\nhome. The game benefits from its access to browns and dark reds, but still comes\r\noff as a very primitive looking home. A table made out of normal walls, and a\r\nslider to represent a chair come off as very crude representations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a bathroom to the right, but that\'s really only established by being\r\nthe smallest room in the house and being mostly white. The front-most room has\r\na yellow solid surrounded by some purple breakables which I can give no\r\ndefinitive meaning to. Perhaps it\'s a carpet that the player is unable to walk\r\non?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_007.png\'%}\" alt=\"007\">\r\n\r\n<p>I of course head straight for the bathroom, and confirm the upper object as a\r\ntoilet.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_008.png\'%}\" alt=\"008\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_010.png\'%}\" alt=\"010\">\r\n\r\n<p>The toilet of course has an eject button which leads to a secret passageway.\r\nSundria likes its slapstick.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_011.png\'%}\" alt=\"011\">\r\n\r\n<p>A more modern ZZT game might have had an object push the player into the\r\nsecret passage to represent being launched, but Sundria just has the toilet\r\nobject disappear and lets the player walk into the fake wall or not at their\r\nleisure.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_012.png\'%}\" alt=\"012\">\r\n\r\n<p>Following the secret path gives the player some equipment including torches\r\nwhich will become essential later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_013.png\'%}\" alt=\"013\">\r\n\r\n<p>Washing your hands scores the player a towel. Whether or not picking up a\r\ntowel counts as a Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy reference is an exercise\r\nleft up to the reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_015.png\'%}\" alt=\"015\">\r\n\r\n<p>That\'s all there is to see in Louis\'s home, so it\'s time to head outside.\r\nThere\'s something about mid 90s ZZT games where they love to not give the player\r\nany motivation from the onset. Anywhere the player goes is solely because the\r\nperson behind the keyboard picked that direction. Louis himself has no goals\r\nyet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sundria also likes text labels. In later years this sort of thing would be\r\nfrowned upon for breaking \"show, don\'t tell\". Of course, I don\'t know how one\r\nwould indicate that this tree is a \"bee fly ptarmigan\" tree. The signs for the\r\nrubbish heap and possum gardens do have little stumps to make them appear less\r\nas text written on a board and more as signs within the world itself so there\r\nis some attempt to keep things within the world itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_019.png\'%}\" alt=\"019\">\r\n\r\n<p>The first place I opted to explore was the Pocket Gopher\'s Burrow.

Actually, so is eating the grub due to an\r\naccidental space in the #endgame command causing the game keep going.

It\'s not exactly good design, but it\'s easy to avoid losing progress\r\nby being proactive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\'s all there is to the Pocket Gopher\'s Burrow.

I think this is the\r\nfirst cutscene board I\'ve ever seen in ZZT where the player gets to it by moving\r\nfrom one board to the next rather than taking a passage. Similarly, the player\r\nnot being in one of the board\'s corners for the cutscene is also a bit unusual,\r\nthough not completely unheard of. The cutscene doesn\'t begin until the player\r\ntouch the boulder object blocking the passage, adding to the confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the player didn\'t pick up the wet towel in Louis\'s house they\'ll be killed\r\nhere due to the heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_128.png\'%}\" alt=\"128\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_129.png\'%}\" alt=\"129\">\r\n\r\n<p>A scroll welcomes Louis to the center of the earth, the hub for the rest of\r\nthe game. Here things get a bit more traditionally ZZT with a quest to travel\r\nto four areas, obtain a key, and unlock some central doors, which in this case\r\nlead to the castle of the aardvarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_131.png\'%}\" alt=\"131\">\r\n\r\n<p>The gems that make up the text flash different colors, and the walks in the\r\ncenter of the board use blinking colors. The blinking walls in the rubbish heap\r\ncould be explained as toxic waste, and I suppose the walls here could be claimed\r\nto be magma, but I was beginning to get pretty suspicious about these blinking\r\nwalls and whether or not they were intended to be blinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_132.png\'%}\" alt=\"132\">\r\n\r\n<p>Like Town, the player is given free reign of which path they\'d like to take\r\nfirst. The passage I happened to reach first led to Yamane Desert. Each area\r\nhas a sort of introduction board like this one, with pushers to push the player\r\ntowards the next board whether they want to move on or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pushers can\'t actually push a player off screen, so there\'s still some manual\r\ninput required. Later ZZT games that wanted to have a sort of intermission\r\nscreen without player input being needed would duplicate a passage on top of a\r\nplayer clone to automatically make the warp.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_134.png\'%}\" alt=\"134\">\r\n\r\n<p>Yamane begins in an oil rig which I wouldn\'t have identified as such without\r\nthe text label. There\'s a blinkwall as a simple obstacle, and a room full of\r\ngems and some strange looking objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_136.png\'%}\" alt=\"136\">\r\n\r\n<p>Touching the break in the line wall reveals that it\'s a pipe leaking hot oil\r\nand that the player can\'t proceed. There\'s\r\ncode to get past the pipe by plugging it up with a wad of phlegm given to the\r\nplayer by another character, but that requires doing these four areas in a\r\ndifferent order than the one I chose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objects are all various foodstuffs which give and take health depending\r\non Louis\'s tastes. From left to right there\'s trail mix (good), a Bunsen burner\r\nwith burnt stuff stuck to it (good), a kettle of fish (good), a bowl of cold\r\noatmeal (bad), a lutefisk sandwich (bad), and a lamburger with relish (good).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_140.png\'%}\" alt=\"140\">\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the oil rig is an ad for a... pickle vat?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_144.png\'%}\" alt=\"144\">\r\n\r\n<p>And a scroll with additional information on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again with this board, the normal walls that make up the animal on the\r\nbillboard are blinking. It very much feels like a mistake, and by now I was\r\nsure that the blinking walls were not supposed to be such. So let\'s get into how\r\nsuch a thing could happen (since it\'s just going to keep on happening throughout\r\nthe rest of the game).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT\'s text mode uses blinking characters rather than high intensity\r\nbackgrounds (much to the dismay of everybody trying to squeeze out better\r\ngraphics). That some characters are flashing on and off like this should be\r\nobvious when working on the game, but for some reason Sundria manages to not\r\nnotice this. Blame Windows! If you happen to run ZZT on an older Windows machine\r\nwith native MS-DOS support, it\'ll run in a window rather than fullscreen by\r\ndefault. When running in a window, the blinking is replaced with high intensity\r\nbackgrounds. So what happened here is almost certainly that the game was\r\nmade on a Windows machine and either Yapok was unaware about the discrepancy in\r\ngraphics or intended the game to be ran in a window on Windows.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So technically the presentation of these screenshots isn\'t representative of\r\nhow the game is meant to look. In Dosbox, the easiest way around this is with\r\nthe utility <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/b/blinkx.ZIP\">BlinkX</a>\r\nwhich forces high intensity backgrounds. It\'s not a huge deal as far as gameplay\r\ngoes, but the blinking definitely makes some boards feel odd.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_147.png\'%}\" alt=\"147\">\r\n\r\n<p>Moving along to the next screen, there\'s a large section of the room locked\r\naway and filled with walls that are immediately transformed into tigers. ZZT can\r\nonly support so many elements with stats like these tigers on the screen at once\r\nso the rest simply become empty spaces. The stat limit being hit has a fun\r\neffect of meaning the tigers are unable to shoot since their projectiles require\r\na stat to be available.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_150.png\'%}\" alt=\"150\">\r\n\r\n<p>Yamane/Yamone (if you want to look at the object\'s name) gives Louis the\r\nfirst key to the castle of the aardvarks and reveals that there\'s no need to\r\nfight the tigers.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_152.png\'%}\" alt=\"152\">\r\n\r\n<p>Key acquired, there are still three more passages to go through.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_154.png\'%}\" alt=\"154\">\r\n\r\n<p>The leftmost passage leads to Yapok Isles.

Their behavior can feel\r\nvery strange to people who don\'t know how they work, but the chair lift can be\r\noperated multiple times so there\'s no real danger of breaking things here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\'s get technical for a moment and explain how this works!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In ZZT\'s editor, placing a player will always just move the player on the\r\nboard to the cursor\'s location, explicitly preventing you from making more than\r\none. Of course, you can still copy the player to the pattern buffer and place\r\nclones that way. You can also just straight up #put &lt;dir&gt; player with an\r\nobject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So for this chair lift, touching the lower part tells the upper part to put\r\na player to the south, wait a little bit, then shoot south to destroy the clone.\r\nOnce the clone appears, the player needs to move in a direction that the clone\r\nisn\'t blocked in. ZZT updates elements with stats in the order they were added\r\nto the board. The first stat is always the player (unless you go so far as to\r\nhex edit a ZZT file), so the actual player presses down and moves down. ZZT\r\nkeeps processing the stats and eventually reaches the player clone and runs the\r\nsame player update code on it. It sees that the down key was pressed and moves\r\nthe REAL player below the clone. The clone stands still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason the actual player moves rather than the clone is because there\r\nshould only be one player on the screen, and it\'s the first stat, so rather than\r\nsearch out the stat that needs to have its coordinates changed, ZZT can just be\r\nlazy and assume that it wants to update the coordinates of the first stat,\r\nsetting the actual player\'s coordinates to the new location!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s all a wonderful coincidence in ZZT\'s coding that this works out the way\r\nit does. It could\'ve been a situation where the player clone would move itself\r\nsouth instead, or the \"move south from here\" vector using the first stat\'s\r\ncoordinates as the origin point rather than the clone\'s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another coincidence is that the player clone can be destroyed just by\r\nshooting it and without losing any health. This happens because when the clone\r\nis shot, ZZT only checks if it was the first stat element that got shot when\r\ndetermining if health needs to be reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these weird behaviors have done wonders for ZZT\'s capabilities and\r\nif clones had been handled differently, it would have had a tremendous impact on\r\nlater ZZT games which player clones\' unique properties become essential engine\r\nfeatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course all of this here has to happen because there\'s no way to move\r\nthe player to an arbitrary location on a board via ZZT-OOP.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_212.png\'%}\" alt=\"212\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/yapok-sundria/zzt_214.png\'%}\" alt=\"214\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next room consists of something buried in the ice and a pick with limited\r\nuses.

I wonder if this articles seems\r\na bit harsh on it? Yes, instant game overs are a poor design decision, the\r\ngraphics are frequently blinking when they shouldn\'t be, and it\'s possible to\r\nrun out of flags. Yet, like a lot of older ZZT worlds, Sundria gets by on its\r\nstrange charms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s not a ton there, but even in its minimalism, you\'ll get a weird sense\r\nof what the world is. It makes me think of the comic strip \"Pogo\" in terms of\r\nsetting. It\'s an adventure to see the world and its characters, all strange and\r\nunusual animals with strange and unusual personalities. A lot of the humor is\r\nwhat today would be considered generic randomness, but I feel like in 1995 this\r\nsort of thing hadn\'t been done to death. Playing Yapok-Sundria as a contemporary\r\nrelease won\'t do it any favors, but it does feel genuine. It\'s not random for\r\nthe sake of being random as much as it\'s random for the sense of conveying\r\nsomething that you wouldn\'t see so much elsewhere in 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes that line between what is random and what is important gets a bit\r\ntoo blurred, like with the meatloaf and the doilies. The mountain climb is also\r\nvery dull (and Yapok admits as much in the guide in the game\'s text file). The\r\ngame feels very safe to explore as long as you don\'t forget to save, and exploration\r\nis really what it\'s all about. The quest for knickerbockers is pure MacGuffin.\r\nLouis\'s journey is completely contrived, and it doesn\'t matter at all. And in\r\nthe mid 90s, ZZT would allow something like that to thrive. Yapok-Sundria isn\'t\r\nan obscure ZZT world lost to the ages, it was a success.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of\r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2017-02-25',1,'django',3,208,'',''),(211,'Closer Look: Oaktown','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get Oaktown?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Oaktown is available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=oaktown1.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_oaktown1\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>.\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also explore the world yourself on the\r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/o/oaktown1.zip?file=OAKTOWN1.ZZT&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT Public Beta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n<h2>Oaktown</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Shaun Taylor and Brian Keeler<br>\r\nPublished Under: Pacific Systems<br>\r\nReleased: Sep. 11, 1993\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Today\'s game is Oaktown, a 1993 release by Shaun Taylor and Brian Keeler, a\r\ngame selected based entirely on the Museum of ZZT\'s file viewer. When working on\r\nthe site, most of the time I can just pick a world at random to use when testing\r\nthe file viewer, which means picking a letter and choosing a game. Taylor and\r\nKeeler\'s Oaktown just so happens to be the first game listed under the letter O,\r\nand when I was browsing through its boards it looked like I had found a ZZT game\r\nwhich looked like it would be a lot of fun to play through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It looked very traditional: explore various areas of a town, collect a few\r\nkeys, and escape the town via the airport or something. The town itself had a\r\nlot of charm, and I just really wanted to play it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And you know what? Oaktown really does have a lot of charm! Its a really fun\r\nworld to explore for awhile. It has charm, but it does not have ammo. It does\r\nnot have health. Oaktown starts off at its peak and only sinks lower and lower\r\nin quality as you try to play it. By the end I just wanted it to be over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let\'s take a look at what OakTown does right, and how its flaws drag down\r\nwhat would likely otherwise have been an early classic of ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_000.png\'%}\" alt=\"000\">\r\n\r\n<p>The world\'s title screen takes an interesting approach. Most ZZTers would\r\npromptly erase ZZT\'s yellow borders placed on each new board. Newer creators\r\nmight leave them behind, but Oaktown leans into it. The borders are made thicker\r\non the sides, committing to them. With the yellow border I\'d expect nothing\r\nfrom this game, but just by thickening some walls, the expectations for the game\r\ngo up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The title itself shows a nice city skyline in breakables, and conveyors below\r\nrotate gems along a path giving the appearance of flashy lights you\'d find on\r\nan old-timey Las Vegas sign. It looks pretty nice in motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game\'s authors are two friends who made this game together, and thus\r\ncreated \"Pacific Systems\". The game is also considered the first episode out of\r\nthree, following a typical shareware model. The other two episodes aren\'t\r\non any archives, and who knows if they even actually exist. Oaktown is the only\r\nknown release by these two or Pacific Systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_004.png\'%}\" alt=\"004\">\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}@Welcome!\r\n$Welcome to Oaktown, A huge project\r\n$put together for you by Pacific Systems.\r\n$PS consists of Shaun Taylor, his\r\n$computer, and anyone else he can get good\r\n$help from!

Who knows at this\r\n                  point!\r\n\r\n  Thank you for taking the time to read\r\n                  this!\r\n              -Shaun Taylor\r\n\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>Oaktown opens with a blend of plot and information on the game\'s authors.\r\nThe story is pretty vague, one of the game\'s programmers has gone rogue and is\r\nmessing things up in the town. Unlike Town of ZZT, there\'s no explicit goal of\r\ncollecting keys or anything, just a plea to find Brian who could be anywhere.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The starting board uses its otherwise unneeded space to give the player some\r\nadvice and show off the game\'s name in large letters. It\'s a bit like what would\r\nbe done by Aceland the following year with its hybrid boards of art and\r\ngameplay.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_007.png\'%}\" alt=\"007\">\r\n\r\n<p>In an unexpected twist, the toilet can\'t be used!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_008.png\'%}\" alt=\"008\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player has an ill-trained dog moving around in the laundry room.\r\nSearching the dryer gives a few gems as loose change. More gems can be found\r\nby rummaging through the couch cushions in the player\'s living room.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_016.png\'%}\" alt=\"016\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s no television, but there is a stereo system which offers two songs to\r\nlisten to, both of which are taken straight from Tim Sweeney\'s original worlds.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_020.png\'%}\" alt=\"020\">\r\n\r\n<p>The fridge is full of rotten food, which will take away health when the\r\nplayer opts to eat any of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_025.png\'%}\" alt=\"025\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_026.png\'%}\" alt=\"026\">\r\n\r\n<p>Except for the bran muffin which induces the need for a bowel movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_027.png\'%}\" alt=\"027\">\r\n\r\n<p>Toilet puzzle solved. This game makes you work for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_029.png\'%}\" alt=\"029\">\r\n\r\n<p>Out in the hallway, Zeke, the rock and roll loving stoner(?) informs the\r\nplayer of the mayor\'s decree preventing travel outside of town. Perhaps this is\r\nthe work of Brian?</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_031.png\'%}\" alt=\"031\">\r\n\r\n<p>Stepping outside onto the streets of Oaktown, the game\'s visuals start off\r\nstrong. Numerous colorful buildings line the street, all of different heights\r\nand using simple shading to give them an effective sense of depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sidewalks are made of breakable walls (and the player can\'t shoot on\r\nthese town boards), which gives Taylor and Keeler the opportunity to have doors\r\non buildings look consistent, with their accessibility being what determines\r\nwhich buildings can be entered vs which are just for decoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_032.png\'%}\" alt=\"032\">\r\n\r\n<p>The streets have life, with some street dancers and a boombox outside, but\r\nalso other objects which are people going about their business who will walk to\r\nthe edge of a screen and disappear, making a trip to somewhere else in town. It\r\nbreathes a lot of life into Oaktown, which is especially necessary for a town of\r\nits size.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_033.png\'%}\" alt=\"033\">\r\n\r\n<p>The dancers will perform for the player for a gem, but can also be attacked\r\nif the player wants to be a jerk. Punching the bro results in the two dancers\r\nattacking the player for a bit, but no lasting repercussions</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_035.png\'%}\" alt=\"035\">\r\n\r\n<p>Paying for the dance results in the cyan dancer moving around in a plus\r\nshape, and some more music made with ZZT\'s \"drum\" sound effects. The player is\r\nalso given a password, though for what exactly is currently unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_040.png\'%}\" alt=\"040\">\r\n\r\n<p>Down the road is city hall, where the person from the previous board walks\r\npast the guards and into the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_043.png\'%}\" alt=\"043\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player unfortunately can\'t enter the building, and needs to find an\r\nalternative entrance to city hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_046.png\'%}\" alt=\"046\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_047.png\'%}\" alt=\"047\">\r\n\r\n<p>The center of Oaktown is packed with buildings, two of which are stores the\r\nplayer can enter to buy supplies. These stores share a board, which comes off\r\nlooking pretty sparse.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_048.png\'%}\" alt=\"048\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_050.png\'%}\" alt=\"050\">\r\n\r\n<p>The prices are... not good. And the ammo dealer is overcharging us! A lot of\r\nmoney will be spent in these stores throughout the game, and every gem that can\r\nbe scrounged up is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_051.png\'%}\" alt=\"051\">\r\n\r\n<p>To the west is the Oak Zoo. Oaktown offers some player freedom in which areas\r\nthey\'d like to explore in which order, but unlike Town of ZZT, it opts for fewer\r\nlocations with larger paths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of ZZT\'s enemies being animals means zoos are a common\r\nlocation in early ZZT games which still relied on them for their action scenes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_054.png\'%}\" alt=\"054\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_058.png\'%}\" alt=\"058\">\r\n\r\n<p>It costs five gems to take a tour of the zoo and good god is this board\r\nvisually noisy! Bears, boulders, sliders, ammo, gems, all strewn about\r\neverywhere. Bears in ZZT don\'t move until the player is with a certain distance\r\nof them, which makes them typically the easiest enemy to fight. It\'s a good\r\nthing too since my ammo is so limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_063.png\'%}\" alt=\"063\">\r\n\r\n<p>Getting through most of the room clears out a lot of the visual clutter. Past\r\na certain point the player gets cut off from the left half of the room and\r\nlocked in the right. The second passage towards the middle of the screen\r\nactually leads to this same board and is used as a crude checkpoint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT offers a board property that the editor labels as \"Re-enter when zapped\".\r\nWhen set to yes, if the player takes damage by bullet or creature, they\'re\r\nwarped back to the tile they entered the room on. This second passage updates\r\nthose coordinates to the new passage\'s location preventing the player from\r\nhaving to traverse the entire board again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it\'s a good thing it\'s here, since there\'s a duplicator creating more\r\nbears. The more time spent wandering cleared sections of the maze, the more\r\nbears can be spawned.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_066.png\'%}\" alt=\"066\">\r\n\r\n<p>This part here is just cruel. There are no other false gems like this in the\r\ngame either. The only way you\'d be able to identify a gem was actually an object\r\nlike this would be if there was a boulder or slider to push it with, since the\r\nonly alternative is that if you shoot a gem it will be destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_071.png\'%}\" alt=\"071\">\r\n\r\n<p>The board ends with the tour guide warning about the next board being full of\r\nlions instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_072.png\'%}\" alt=\"072\">\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m a big fan of the TOURISTs CAGE. The good news here is that most of the\r\nlions on this board are just objects. Some are chasing around the other\r\ntourists, and after shooting them leads to this incredible dialog:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_073.png\'%}\" alt=\"073\">\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m pretty sure this is a Dril tweet circa 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_079.png\'%}\" alt=\"079\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_080.png\'%}\" alt=\"080\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_081.png\'%}\" alt=\"081\">\r\n\r\n<p>Another human in the cage is Shaun Taylor, one of the game\'s programmers. He\r\nreiterates the goal of finding Brian, but offers no advice on how to actually go\r\nabout it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/programmer.png\'%}\" alt=\"programmer\">\r\n\r\n<p>But you darn well better agree to help out lest you get this amazing advice\r\nand an instant game over!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last person in the cage will give you the key to escape it and explore\r\nthe lion village.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_087.png\'%}\" alt=\"087\">\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the lions are spectating the cages, turning it into a zoo of their\r\nown.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_091.png\'%}\" alt=\"091\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_092.png\'%}\" alt=\"092\">\r\n\r\n<p>Oaktown gives the player a lot of opportunities to be violent towards random\r\nobjects, and it never ends well. Asking to learn from him gives the player a\r\nquest to obtain a \"Mystical Torch\" in order to leave the lion\'s realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_097.png\'%}\" alt=\"097\">\r\n\r\n<p>Oaktown has a few moral choices like this one throughout the game. The player\r\ncan steal some gems and they will get away with it, but they\'ll lose points for\r\ndoing so. Meanwhile, if they act responsibly, they\'ll receive bonus points\r\ninstead.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_101.png\'%}\" alt=\"101\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_102.png\'%}\" alt=\"102\">\r\n\r\n<p>A few other lions add some flavor the environment and they do a good job of\r\nit.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_106.png\'%}\" alt=\"106\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a restaurant selling some meat the player can use to regain 16\r\nhealth, which at 4 gems is a decent enough price. Pond water however is dirty\r\nand results in the player losing a single point of health.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_110.png\'%}\" alt=\"110\">\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly there\'s a shooting range that the player can either buy ammo from or\r\nplay a simple minigame to try and get more gems.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_111.png\'%}\" alt=\"111\">\r\n\r\n<p>The shooting gallery features a target that moves up and down in a set\r\npattern. The timing is unfortunately rather precise, and the reward for a hit is\r\nonly a single gem. Missing the target instantly ends the minigame until more\r\nmoney is paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if a player can reliably shoot the target, the rewards are too small to\r\nbe worthwhile. You\'re still consuming ammo so even after breaking even in gems,\r\nyou still need to spend money to replenish the ammo it took to hit the target\r\nin the first place. In fact, more than 20 hits on the target are needed to turn\r\na profit of a single ammo. </p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_114.png\'%}\" alt=\"114\">\r\n\r\n<p>And you\'ll need 20 gems to be able to proceed with the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_116.png\'%}\" alt=\"116\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_118.png\'%}\" alt=\"118\">\r\n\r\n<p>This dark room is a long winding path to get the Mystical Torch. There\'s not\r\nmuch to it, but I did manage to run out of ammo three-quarters through and have\r\nto run back through the dark to buy more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lack of ammo is already hurting this game, but it was still early enough\r\nthat I could brush it off as me not having been expected to enter the zoo first.\r\nStill poor design, but design that could be worked around by having picked a\r\ndifferent location to explore first.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_126.png\'%}\" alt=\"126\">\r\n\r\n<p>With the torch obtained, the player can return it to the <s>lion king</s>\r\n<s>king of red lions</s> ruler of the lions and procure an exit to the next zoo\r\nexhibit, but there\'s still an unexplored treasure room to pillage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_128.png\'%}\" alt=\"128\">\r\n\r\n<p>The treasure room is another action board, though one that is optional.\r\nWith how starved I am for resources, it looked like I\'d be able to get through\r\nit with more ammo than I started with at the very least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately the player need to run through a gauntlet of spinning guns, and\r\nthere\'s nothing the player can do but hope for good luck getting through\r\nunscathed as there are no safe tiles to stand on that aren\'t being shot at by\r\na gun.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_129.png\'%}\" alt=\"129\">\r\n\r\n<p>From there the player will have to run a short relay to some buttons to open\r\nup further passage through the treasure room, keeping in mind that there are\r\nthree duplicators on screen producing more and more lions as time goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also this guy who starts talking about how he likes cats.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_130.png\'%}\" alt=\"130\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_131.png\'%}\" alt=\"131\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_132.png\'%}\" alt=\"132\">\r\n\r\n<p>It uh, takes a rather unexpected turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_135.png\'%}\" alt=\"135\">\r\n\r\n<p>Once in the main portion of the room it becomes a test of the player\'s\r\nability to hit lions without wasting too much ammo in the process. Eventually\r\nthe player will make it into the treasure room and be able to pick up the\r\nsupplies as well as a bonus of 40 gems from the lion\'s treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_138.png\'%}\" alt=\"138\">\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s still not over however, as the player will need to backtrack through the\r\nroom again.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_139.png\'%}\" alt=\"139\">\r\n\r\n<p>And that didn\'t pay off at all. I left the treasure room with one fewer ammo\r\nthan I started with, and with nearly 200 health fewer than before.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_141.png\'%}\" alt=\"141\">\r\n\r\n<p>Next up is the snake cage. The lion doesn\'t say anything when you present him\r\nwith the torch, just quietly opens up the door to the next room.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_142.png\'%}\" alt=\"142\">\r\n\r\n<p>The snake cage is the final section of the zoo and is officially where my\r\nplaythrough fell apart completely. It\'s another maze, with another person who\r\ntalks about snakes the same way that guy from earlier talking about lions.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_150.png\'%}\" alt=\"150\">\r\n\r\n<p>Despite my best efforts, it became clear that I did not have the resources\r\nneeded to get through the board without cheating. The big boa was too big to\r\nshoot and too long to take a bunch of damage to get through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The room is a single tile wide, ensuring that every snake meant taking 10\r\npoints of damage. Duplicators meant that there was simply not enough ammo to\r\nget through.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_152.png\'%}\" alt=\"152\">\r\n\r\n<p>I gave in and zapped straight to the exit bypassing the rest of the screen\r\nentirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_153.png\'%}\" alt=\"153\">\r\n\r\n<p>And just like that, the player is unceremoniously dumped back outside of the\r\nzoo. (Okay, turns out there\'s a gem that turns into a key in there that I\r\nmissed, but at first I was unsure if the entire zoo was optional. After all, I\r\nhad no guidance other than \"find Brian\" and now I\'ve learned he\'s not in the\r\nzoo.)</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_155.png\'%}\" alt=\"155\">\r\n\r\n<p>In the southwest corner of Oaktown is the airport, with its very tiny little\r\nrunway. The player can\'t yet enter, for reasons unstated and on par with a\r\nPokémon game for roadblocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_157.png\'%}\" alt=\"157\">\r\n\r\n<p>The southernmost section of town has nothing of interest but a locked gate.\r\nThe player won\'t be leaving town anytime soon while the mayor has forbid it.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_160.png\'%}\" alt=\"160\">\r\n\r\n<p>On the center right screen (I went back to the center to spend my gems on\r\nsupplies), is the town bar and part of an American football field. The two\r\nobjects out on the field will shoot a ball back and forth at each other for a\r\nfun little detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_166.png\'%}\" alt=\"166\">\r\n\r\n<p>The bar is a private club, and requires the password provided by the dancers\r\nfrom earlier to be let in.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_167.png\'%}\" alt=\"167\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_168.png\'%}\" alt=\"168\">\r\n\r\n<p>Lending the drunk some money foreshadows that the park won\'t be any better\r\nfor supplies than the zoo was. Things aren\'t looking good for my enjoyment of\r\nOaktown.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_169.png\'%}\" alt=\"169\">\r\n\r\n<p>The bar offers a few items, beer will restore 1 health for _three_ gems,\r\n(The bartender cites a tax on beer,) a meal will restore 4, and beernuts are\r\njust a waste of money.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_171.png\'%}\" alt=\"171\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_172.png\'%}\" alt=\"172\">\r\n\r\n<p>The bar\'s other patrons are just for flavor.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_179.png\'%}\" alt=\"179\">\r\n\r\n<p>In the top right corner of the bar is a pay phone! The first time the player\r\ninteracts with it they\'ll find a gem in the coin return and make the first call\r\nfor free, but if they want to see the others they\'ll each cost a gem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They\'re all of course basic crank calls for Stu Piddiot, Hugh Jass, and\r\nIsabelle Ringing. Thankfully the bartender never makes the connection that the\r\ncall is coming from inside the bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the bar ultimately serves as a third store to purchase health from, but\r\nthere aren\'t nearly enough gems to go around for the supplies the player will\r\nneed to complete Oaktown without cheating.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_203.png\'%}\" alt=\"203\">\r\n\r\n<p>The northeast corner of town contains a really fun sequence with these two\r\nneighboring buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_208.png\'%}\" alt=\"208\">\r\n\r\n<p>The savings and loan has been closed down and the security system is\r\nbroken...</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_204.png\'%}\" alt=\"204\">\r\n\r\n<p>The ACME co. warehouse meanwhile is full of ruffians, some ammo, and a very\r\nconvenient bomb.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_210.png\'%}\" alt=\"210\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_211.png\'%}\" alt=\"211\">\r\n\r\n<p>I expected the explosion to just wipe out a huge chunk of the wall since it\r\nall appeared to be made of breakables, but most of it is an object. There is\r\nconsistency in the breakables representing the tops of the walls being replaced\r\nwith solids are the player is now seeing the sides. It\'s a mix of good detail\r\nwork but also creates the appearance of a perfectly clean break in the wall from\r\nthe explosion.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_212.png\'%}\" alt=\"212\">\r\n\r\n<p>Though the bank\'s electronic security system\'s wall blinks on and off, the\r\ntigers seem to be working just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_213.png\'%}\" alt=\"213\">\r\n\r\n<p>At least until ZZT\'s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/worldsofzzt/status/808385666018967552\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nglitch with blink walls</a> mangles things.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_215.png\'%}\" alt=\"215\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player is free to rob the bank and gets a decent amount of money from\r\ntheir crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_217.png\'%}\" alt=\"217\">\r\n\r\n<p>The final corner of town consists of the rest of the town\'s football field\r\nand entrances to its lake and park.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_220.png\'%}\" alt=\"220\">\r\n\r\n<p>The lake is locked away behind two doors, one from the zoo which has been\r\nskipped so far, and the other to be obtained in the Oaktown park.

Oaktown does\r\nsomething that no other ZZT game has here: made a dark board interesting to look\r\nat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt\'s using the <a href=\"http://zzt.org/fora/viewtopic.php?p=52162#p52162\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nKangaroo Effect</a> in 1993 when the concept wouldn\'t be codified and named\r\nproper until 2007, a good fourteen years before its \"discovery\"!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the kangaroo effect is not actually the most descriptive name,\r\nperhaps an explanation is in order: In dark rooms, as expected, most elements\r\nare obscured by darkness, with two exceptions, torches, and passages. Normally\r\nin a dark room the player has no real sense of direction as they can only see\r\nwhat\'s in actively within their torch\'s light radius. By having the outer bounds\r\nof a room filled with torches or passages it\'s possible to create a boards that\r\ncan easily be navigated even in darkness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Kangaroo Effect, specifically the idea is to use torches/passages\r\nwith a matching foreground and background color to make them appear as regular\r\nwalls in darkness (and with a border of actual walls that will be hidden in\r\ndarkness to prevent the player from picking them up or entering a passage).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here the torches are used to represent a forested environment, just like the\r\nforest seen in Town of ZZT, but with darkness to create this absolutely striking\r\nlooking appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_229.png\'%}\" alt=\"229\">\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, while I can gush about this area being the prettiest looking dark\r\narea I have ever seen in a ZZT world, it\'s going to be ruined by Oaktown\'s\r\nsense of gameplay balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_231.png\'%}\" alt=\"231\">\r\n\r\n<p>Here\'s the board with the lights on, which makes it significantly more dull\r\nlooking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The park isn\'t quite as bad as the zoo, at least at first. I\'m entering it\r\nwith about a hundred more ammo than I had in the zoo at least, and the enemies\r\nare more safely sectioned off by the forest tiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_236.png\'%}\" alt=\"236\">\r\n\r\n<p>The mysterious beta character is revealed to be a water fountain that gives\r\nthe player some health, but only once as they\'ve been sufficiently refreshed\r\nafterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_238.png\'%}\" alt=\"238\">\r\n\r\n<p>Making a good dark room is extremely difficult, but the mix of the kangaroo\r\neffect, as well as the forest preventing the player from being sniped by tiger\r\nbullets from across the room does quite a lot to make things more approachable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_249.png\'%}\" alt=\"249\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_250.png\'%}\" alt=\"250\">\r\n\r\n<p>I was so caught up in how nice these boards looked that I didn\'t even bother\r\nto take screenshots with the lights cheated back on. The good news, there\'s not\r\nexactly much to see. Lots of forest, with pockets of various enemies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second board has a talking tree who rather than give investment advice\r\nlike in Town of ZZT opts to instead talk about needing a forest key to leave.\r\nNear the tree is a scared man who\'s been stuck in the park without any torches.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_252.png\'%}\" alt=\"252\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_255.png\'%}\" alt=\"255\">\r\n\r\n<p>If you help him out, you\'ll get a few torches. If you refuse, he not only\r\ntakes away some points and shoots at you, but also drains your torches to zero.\r\nThe morality is laid on a bit thicker here than in the zoo. You better help him\r\nor not interact with him at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is competently programmed at least! If you don\'t actually have any torches\r\nto give he won\'t be upset and will just leave on his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_259.png\'%}\" alt=\"259\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next board opens with a trap as the player is immediately (most likely)\r\ngoing to break through a forest tile and into the pocket of lions.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_262.png\'%}\" alt=\"262\">\r\n\r\n<p>Up ahead is a river with a bridge to cross guarded by a single ruffian.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_264.png\'%}\" alt=\"264\">\r\n\r\n<p>A little bit later, the same river winds requiring a second crossing, but\r\nthis time the bridge is protected by a troll.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_265.png\'%}\" alt=\"265\">\r\n\r\n<p>The toll is twenty gems, and attempting to kick his butt will result in\r\ngetting shot a few times before making him disappear. Better to pay the toll.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_268.png\'%}\" alt=\"268\">\r\n\r\n<p>Or at least, it would be if the troll was placed in a way that actually\r\nblocked the player\'s path. The player can just waltz on by.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_274.png\'%}\" alt=\"274\">\r\n\r\n<p>The next board marks roughly the halfway point for the park. There\'s a\r\ntransporter blocked by a white door with the key visible on the other side\r\nof the lake.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_276.png\'%}\" alt=\"276\">\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the ammo and gems scattered in the park (none of these torches\r\nare actually collectible), are some health objects which give 50 health back.\r\nThe zoo had a few of these, but was much more difficult to get through. Here\r\nhealth has been holding fairly steady at least. My ammo is definitely\r\napproaching zero and I could only hope I\'d be done with the park before running\r\nout again.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_279.png\'%}\" alt=\"279\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_280.png\'%}\" alt=\"280\">\r\n\r\n<p>Wait, I lied. This one torch has a fake wall I accidentally walked into which\r\nlet me collect it!</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_287.png\'%}\" alt=\"287\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_292.png\'%}\" alt=\"292\">\r\n\r\n<p>After reaching the white key, I get to turn around to discover where the\r\ntransporter leads. While most of the earlier enemies had been shot, I did leave\r\nthat giant centipede alone giving me something to sneak past another two times.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this tiny island sits the forest key, which was said to be required to\r\nget out of here. With it, I can continue on the path I was following beforehand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_296.png\'%}\" alt=\"296\">\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately up ahead is the forest door. Though the park had a few optional\r\nareas so far, it\'s basically been a linear path to this point, and putting an\r\nextra door here really didn\'t add anything other than a small backtrack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately though, I\'m grateful that I didn\'t have to redo a huge chunk of\r\nthe park because of a missing key or something.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_298.png\'%}\" alt=\"298\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_299.png\'%}\" alt=\"299\">\r\n\r\n<p>Up ahead is finally the end of the forest. There are a few passages to enter\r\nand some mysterious percent signs up above the starting area.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_300.png\'%}\" alt=\"300\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_301.png\'%}\" alt=\"301\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_302.png\'%}\" alt=\"302\">\r\n\r\n<p>They turn out to be some sort of berry bush which kills you for eating from\r\nit.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_306.png\'%}\" alt=\"306\">\r\n\r\n<p>The board is cut in two by another river, and this time with no bridge to\r\ncross.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_307.png\'%}\" alt=\"307\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_308.png\'%}\" alt=\"308\">\r\n\r\n<p>The other path leads to the den of the ruffian. Take a look at that ammo\r\ncount and realize I have no chance to not have to cheat some more. Despite my\r\nupcoming doom, I at least got the relief of having a board that wasn\'t dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_311.png\'%}\" alt=\"311\">\r\n\r\n<p>I almost did actually make it through without running out of ammo, but then\r\nthe ruffians in this last room blocked the door preventing it from opening all\r\nthe way. Shortly after zapping the door away I got myself killed by these last\r\nfew ruffians.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_318.png\'%}\" alt=\"318\">\r\n\r\n<p>My second attempt went a little better. Pulling the lever opened the final\r\ndoor to the leader of the ruffians, but meant backtracking through the\r\ngauntlet.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_320.png\'%}\" alt=\"320\">\r\n\r\n<p>Where I promptly discovered that the only way to pass was to kill all the\r\nruffian enemies remaining.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_324.png\'%}\" alt=\"324\">\r\n\r\n<p>Having done that I was able to pass and learn that these gems were blocked\r\nby invisible walls and that I would be getting no healing here.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_325.png\'%}\" alt=\"325\">\r\n\r\n<p>The leader of the ruffians calls the player out for destroying everything\r\nin the warehouse earlier, and lets them leave. It\'s very clear I\'m a force to\r\nbe reckoned with and not a single hit from death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the player hasn\'t done the warehouse the events unfold the same, but with\r\na comment about how you killed everybody in the ruffian den instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_328.png\'%}\" alt=\"328\">\r\n\r\n<p>The other end of the den has a few doors with some supplies behind them\r\nwhich are locked and can never be obtained. Great.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_331.png\'%}\" alt=\"331\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_335.png\'%}\" alt=\"335\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a lever which allows the player to cross the river to the last\r\nportion of the park still unexplored.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_336.png\'%}\" alt=\"336\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_337.png\'%}\" alt=\"337\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player then eats a beehive.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_341.png\'%}\" alt=\"341\">\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s another building up ahead, this time a ranger station. There\'s a\r\nvery weird design decision here where it\'s blocked off by invisible walls and\r\nrequires a transporter to get inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_342.png\'%}\" alt=\"342\">\r\n\r\n<p>The other transporter is right below, along with some sliders in case the\r\nplayer removes the forest tiles that block the transporter and would cause the\r\nplayer to just be transported to the tile above them instead of to the other\r\nside.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_344.png\'%}\" alt=\"344\">\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the ranger station are yet more items that can\'t be obtained. The\r\ndoors are locked with no way to unlock them. If the doors are shot, they\'re\r\ndestroyed and revealed to have invisible walls behind them preventing access\r\nstill.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_345.png\'%}\" alt=\"345\">\r\n\r\n<p>The ranger at least gives the player one of the keys to the beach ending\r\nthis area.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_351.png\'%}\" alt=\"351\">\r\n\r\n<p>Outside, I\'m left with almost no health, or ammo, or torches. Somehow I don\'t\r\nthink doing the park first and then the zoo would have gone any better, to be\r\nable to get through any section requires buying a lot of supplies from the\r\nshops, and the player won\'t have the money until they go through one of these\r\nsections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oaktown has so much promise, but it keeps wearing me down more and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_353.png\'%}\" alt=\"353\">\r\n\r\n<p>This was the point where I got stuck, and had to look at the game\'s code to\r\ndiscover the missing key in the zoo.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_355.png\'%}\" alt=\"355\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_357.png\'%}\" alt=\"357\">\r\n\r\n<p>Backtracking through the zoo is rather unpleasant, and I just give in and zap\r\nthrough a bunch of walls to get this over with.

The player can tunnel their way\r\nthrough the slime lake on to the next board. This is the only board in the town\r\nwhere the player can shoot making it easy to not realize it\'s even an option.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_373.png\'%}\" alt=\"373\">\r\n\r\n<p>You better believe there are some ninja turtles living in the sewers of\r\nOaktown. They all just move around randomly, though one of them pinned behind\r\na slime gives you bonus points and pizza if you rescue him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bulk of the sewers consists of navigating a brief maze filled with short\r\ncentipedes while trying to not get attacked by the sharks (described as sewer\r\ngators) in the water. There are two keys to pick up to finish the area, and both\r\nof them are green so there\'s some backtracking necessary due to the one key of\r\neach color limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_387.png\'%}\" alt=\"387\">\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to proceed form here is through a sewage pipe, with no real idea\r\nwhere it will lead the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_389.png\'%}\" alt=\"389\">\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out all of this was just a very elaborate way to get inside city\r\nhall.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_390.png\'%}\" alt=\"390\">\r\n\r\n<p>Oaktown City Hall looks great. The zoo was busy, and the park had some nice\r\nvisual touches, but this board is classic ZZT at its finest. There\'s a lot\r\ngoing on here, but the board doesn\'t feel cramped or chaotic. The line walls as\r\npillars is a great effect that I can\'t recall having come across elsewhere,\r\nand it just looks like a fun board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of the toilets in the restroom have doors apparently, and the other\r\nperson sitting on a toilet says they\'d kill you right now if they weren\'t\r\ncurrently busy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top toilet offers some excellent star trek/toilet humor:</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}@toilet\r\nHow are toilet paper...\r\n/i/i/i/i/i\r\nand the U.S.S Enterprise alike?\r\n/i/i/i/i/i/i/i\r\nThey both circle Uranus killing Klingons!\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_424.png\'%}\" alt=\"424\">\r\n\r\n<p>Despite just how much is going on here, I somehow missed a ton of it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a small invisible maze full of fake keys and I apparently thought I\r\nhad checked the red one and revealed it as fake, but it\'s very much an actual\r\nkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The red key lets you into the room with ruffians who claim they\'re saboteurs\r\ndeleting important records and they offer to pay you to detonate the bomb in the\r\nfiling room. The reward is the yellow key to the security center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the security center you can steal an ID card from a sleeping guard, and\r\nuse it to open the left wing of city hall where you\'ll run in with the good\r\nprogrammer of the game Shaun again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last area contains the town\'s actual mayor, who was imprisoned by Brian\r\nand another random captured woman who gives the player a kiss for being rescued.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But all of this is very easily missed as the white key obtained in the zoo\r\nopens up access to the mayor\'s office where the player will meet up with the\r\nevil programmer Brian.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_429.png\'%}\" alt=\"429\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_430.png\'%}\" alt=\"430\">\r\n\r\n<p>Brian breaks through the wall and the player has to give chase.

Oaktown\r\nhas been a flawed game, but one with clear potential up to this point. Right\r\naround here the game starts going all over the place, and really loses its\r\ncohesion.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_439.png\'%}\" alt=\"439\">\r\n\r\n<p>Any expectations of a non-linear chase go out the window as two of the Brians\r\nplace locked doors in the way turning this segment into a strictly linear affair,\r\nand one with a needless invisible maze.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_441.png\'%}\" alt=\"441\">\r\n\r\n<p>The chase is a gauntlet and gets very abstract. I\'m not going to pretend the\r\nlayout of Oak Zoo was anything like an actual zoo, but it was still a video game\r\ntake on what a zoo could be. Here we chased Brian from city hall to whatever\r\nthe heck this place is.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_443.png\'%}\" alt=\"443\">\r\n\r\n<p>The author openly admits as such.

The reward\r\nfor all of this is the yellow key to the next passage, and exit from this first\r\nroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I head back, open the door, and enter the middle passage which leads me to...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_460.png\'%}\" alt=\"460\">\r\n\r\n<p>This rather strange board consisting of a drawing of a stick figure with\r\na gun, two dozen or so invisible enemies, and a bomb salesman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now the player has to run to the stick figure\'s crotch to hit the button\r\nwhile randomly being shot at by invisible and bullet immune enemies.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_464.png\'%}\" alt=\"464\">\r\n\r\n<p>The bomb salesman can give the player a bomb, or reveal the enemies, but\r\nfor an absolutely massive price by this game\'s standards. The bombs are more\r\nreasonable, but can\'t be moved very far, and if the salesman is caught in the\r\nexplosion, they\'ll throw a star at the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_468.png\'%}\" alt=\"468\">\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s a bad situation all around, but it gets worse when I pick up the key and\r\nfind myself trapped by one of the enemies. Again they can\'t be shot, and ZZT\r\ndoesn\'t let you shoot objects at point blank anyway. The invisible stalker\'s\r\ncode makes it so that that if jammed into this position, they will lock up and\r\nnever be able to get out due to having a line where they try to move randomly\r\neither east or west, and if they\'re blocked in both of those directions they\'ll\r\nkeep trying forever, pinning the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_475.png\'%}\" alt=\"475\">\r\n\r\n<p>After zapping my way out of a softlock, I take the red key and open the final\r\npassage, and am pleased to find there is no third board to go with the other\r\ntwo.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_476.png\'%}\" alt=\"476\">\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt, back on the streets of Oaktown I can finally enter the airport, the\r\nonly place left unexplored and a fitting place for Brian to be since he\'s been\r\non the run.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_478.png\'%}\" alt=\"478\">\r\n\r\n<p>Ha ha ha.

Oaktown has a nasty habit of using flags for\r\nthings and not clearing them, just like what happened with Yapok-Sundria, the\r\ngame eventually runs out and things start breaking as flags get overwritten with\r\nnew ones. The game uses a flag to make sure you talked with each person in the\r\nwaiting area which is 6/10 flags right there. Needless to say, this segment\r\ncouldn\'t be completed without manually clearing some old flags.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_571.png\'%}\" alt=\"571\">\r\n\r\n<p>Disabling the security system from earlier allows the player to tamper with\r\nthe security field here and proceed through. There\'s a passage to the luggage\r\ncarousel which no doubt will be necessary so I head there immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_572.png\'%}\" alt=\"572\">\r\n\r\n<p>The goal here is to pick up the purple key to the back of the ticket sales\r\ndesk, as well as the two cyan keys needed to escape the carousel itself.

In this case it\'s\r\nnot Shaun and Brian\'s fault though, but a bug with ZZT. Something about ZZT\'s\r\nconveyor code and bomb code can cause things to get all jumbled up, resulting\r\nin <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKsFP_rV4fs\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nthe player being destroyed and ZZT softlocking</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_576.png\'%}\" alt=\"576\">\r\n\r\n<p>This of course happens to me, and I\'m forced to restart Dosbox entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_585.png\'%}\" alt=\"585\">\r\n\r\n<p>Back outside the player can just move through the crowd and behind the ticket\r\ncounter.

The employee checks if you\r\nhave the fake ticket first, then the actual ticket. This means if you pick up\r\nthe fake ticket at all, you\'ll always trigger the fake ticket message and have\r\nto manually clear the flag to remove it from the player\'s inventory. It\'s one\r\nlast cruel joke for Oaktown to play.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_589.png\'%}\" alt=\"589\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_592.png\'%}\" alt=\"592\">\r\n\r\n<p>The player catches up with Brian, who boards the plane just before it takes\r\noff. There\'s a nice effect here with the stairs to the plane disappearing and\r\nthen the visible portion of the plane as well, followed by that tiny dot in the\r\nsky that is the airplane flying off to wherever.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_593.png\'%}\" alt=\"593\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{% static \'images/articles/cl/oaktown/zzt_594.png\'%}\" alt=\"594\">\r\n\r\n<p>Oaktown draws to a close with Brian\'s escape and some weird explanation of\r\njust what powers as a programmer and sentient being in a ZZT world are available\r\nto him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s an unhappy ending really, and unfortunately the game\'s sequels aren\'t\r\nuploaded anywhere. On the one hand, I\'d love to see what these other episodes\r\nare like, but at the same time I am so glad I am done with Oaktown.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Oaktown is a failed classic, and it\'s such a shame. It has so many fun ideas,\r\nwonderful graphics for a 1993 ZZT game, and memorable locations. Oaktown goes\r\nwell beyond Town of ZZT and does a solid job at creating a world that while\r\nstill very clearly a video game is also grounded in reality enough to feel like\r\nan actual place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for how much it does right, it all crumbles when you actually sit down\r\nand play it. There are simply not enough resources to beat the game without\r\nusing cheats. The shops are expensive, and what\'s provided for the player to\r\ncollect can\'t stave off the inevitable drain of resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The worst part of all this is that quite simply, it\'s a numbers problem. All\r\nof this could be averted by just starting the player off with 1000 health and\r\n500 ammo. It wouldn\'t be a particularly elegant solution compared to properly\r\nbalancing the game, but even such a quick and dirty fix would\'ve elevated the\r\ngame to a much higher level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are definitely some other issues that could have been caught in\r\ntesting, with bugs from flags or the invisible walls blocking off the airport\r\nexit. Oaktown feels like its authors went through the same feelings I went\r\nthrough playing it, an exciting start leading to just a slog at the end. I\r\ndidn\'t want to keep playing it, and from the \"I got bored\" comments in the chase\r\nsequence, I don\'t think the authors wanted to keep making it. There\'s definitely\r\nsome material here that would\'ve been best left on the cutting room floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oaktown could\'ve served as a learning experience for Brian and Shaun, but\r\nwith no other released ZZT worlds by them available, it looks like there never\r\nwas anything to come from the game. If an episode 2 and 3 do actually exist out\r\nthere somewhere, I wouldn\'t expect them to play any differently from this first\r\nepisode. With a few tweaks here and there, and perhaps some scaling back on the\r\nend, I feel like Oaktown would be one of those iconic early ZZT games like\r\nAceland, but it winds up leaving such a bad aftertaste that by the time it\'s\r\nover you don\'t want to go back.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of\r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2017-03-12',1,'django',3,211,'',''),(214,'Closer Look: Doom','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get Doom?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Doom is available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=doom.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_doom\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>.\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also explore the world yourself on the\r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/d/doom.zip?file=DOOM.ZZT&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT Public Beta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_001.png\' %}\r\n<h2>Doom</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: Robojim<br>\r\n<!--Published Under: <br>-->\r\nReleased: Aug. 12, 1995\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Each month the <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\">Worlds of ZZT patrons</a> pledging $2 or more are invited to vote\r\non one of the worlds to receive a closer look article the next month.

And\r\nit did so thanks to a mighty 4-way tie in the votes with ties being biased\r\ntowards patron choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'ve definitely played Doom for ZZT in the past (and I\'m likely going to keep\r\nclarifying \"for ZZT\" throughout this article), and it was a very forgettable\r\nexperience. If you\'re looking for a faithful fan adaption of the revolutionary\r\nFPS game, ZZT is not the medium you\'ll find it in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing up myself, Doom was always one of my favorite games, and probably\r\nonly falls behind ZZT in terms of time sunk in a computer game as a child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s not a lot that can be said about Doom for ZZT itself, but there\'s\r\ndefinitely some discussion to be had when it comes to game creation tools and\r\ncreating a ZZT world versus creating a custom Doom wad. For now though, let\'s\r\nget rid into Robojim\'s attempts to capture Doom in ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_003.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The title screen opens with an impressive rendition of the game\'s logo, and\r\ndone without the use of any colors that can\'t be produced in ZZT\'s default\r\neditor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of bombs that have been pre-armed are scattered on the screen,\r\ncreating their colorful explosions, and on occasion the screen\'s black\r\nbackground flashes a bright white. Doom for ZZT manages to have some great\r\ngraphics, and some hideous looking rooms as well. It\'s a mixed bag.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_004.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The game opens with a difficulty selection and an overview on the enemies\r\nthe player will be fighting. \"Troopers\" and \"Sargeants\" make up the former\r\nhumans seen in the original and barons of hell represented as green (an odd\r\nchoice) smiley faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the game\'s roster of hellspawn hasn\'t fared as well, being\r\nreplaced with tigers, lions, and ruffians, but at the same time the behavior of\r\nthese ZZT creatures matches up approximately enough. The ZZT imps will still\r\nshoot at the player, the demons will only have melee attacks, and the lost\r\nsouls will have staggered movement and frequently charge at the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also various powerups, ZZT has no viable alternative to Doom\'s\r\narmor system, so the small health and armor pickups are both gems which will\r\ngive health. While Doom had eight weapons, each with their own situational uses,\r\nZZT has \"gun\", and thus no ammo specialization. You pick up bullets and shoot\r\nbullets. There\'s no stunlocking cacodemons with rapid chaingun fire, no worry\r\nabout splash damage from a rocket fired too close, or liquefying a room with a\r\nconcentrated blast of plasma from a BFG9000.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_005.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_006.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are ZZT fan games for all sorts of video games, Sonic, Mario,\r\nFinal Fantasy, Duke Nukem, Pokemon, King\'s Quest, and dozens more, Doom for ZZT\r\nis the only one I\'m aware of which explicitly offers the player to purchase the\r\nsource game that inspired their ZZT world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t think anybody played this game and called 1-800-IDGAMES.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a warning about possibly buggy code, but it all looks\r\nstraightforward enough that I can\'t see any way for the game\'s enemies to break.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_008.png\' tl=\'34,15\' br=\'59,24\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, there\'s the difficulty selection. This isn\'t something you see in\r\nmost ZZT games, and usually when you do it\'s just free starting health and ammo\r\non easier difficulties. While Doom for ZZT doesn\'t have dynamic enemy spawns\r\nthat change based on the selected difficulty, it does incorporate object based\r\nmonsters moving faster on harder skill levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NIGHTMARE! difficulty is also unique in that it attempts to emulate Doom\'s\r\nrespawning monsters as well. On this difficulty when an object based enemy is\r\nkilled, they become invisible, stop moving, and wait a bit before reappearing\r\nwith their health restored to create the illusion of an infinite supply of\r\nmonsters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s a cool idea, but falls apart since only some enemies are objects, so\r\nmany enemies will die permanently instead. Additionally, a \"dead\" monster still\r\ntakes up space on the board, blocking the player and their bullets as if there\r\nwas a wall in the way</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_009.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The game begins in earnest with the player plopped down into the game\'s first\r\nand only level. Doom for ZZT is not a long game. Immediately the enemies begin\r\nmoving and shooting haphazardly as the player makes their way across the room,\r\nshooting anything that gets in their way, and picking up the few resources\r\navailable.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_013.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>A backpack in the corner offers some extra ammo, but the player honestly\r\ndoesn\'t need to do all that much shooting. Infighting in Doom is pretty iconic.\r\nIf the player could trick one monster into hitting another, they\'d begin to\r\nfight each other. This makes large firefights a lot easier to get through or\r\ncan aid a player that\'s low on ammo to conserve what little they have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that ZZT can sort of replicate this! Objects can shoot\r\nother objects! The bad news is that as has been seen in several other games\r\npreviously looked at, friendly fire means that enemies have a much easier time\r\ntaking out each other than the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s not much that can be done about this, and it\'s a huge hurdle to\r\novercome when creating an action game in ZZT. AI is at best a mixture of moving\r\nand shooting randomly as well as towards the player, but in practice objects\r\nwill get stuck against walls with the player on the other side, and have no\r\nself-preservation when it comes to not stepping in the way of a bullet. The lack\r\nof hitscan combined with haphazard movement puts Doom in a tight spot.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_017.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The first board was a messy mixture of blue and cyan, hardly pretty, but not\r\ntoo painful on the eyes. This next board opts for a more blinding mixture of\r\ngreen and purple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This green room opts to use ZZT\'s built in creatures rather than objects, and\r\nwhile it certainly doesn\'t feel like Doom, it\'s much more palatable as a ZZT\r\nboard. And let\'s be honest, the first board didn\'t feel like Doom either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doom\'s architecture and ZZT\'s have their similarities. Neither are capable of\r\npresenting realistic spaces, but both games have had countless authors make\r\nvaliant attempts, sometimes with surprising results. Both games prioritize action\r\nand exploration of space over story and sensibility. I don\'t think any spaceport\r\nhangar\'s in the future will have jagged walkways over pools of toxic slime, but\r\nDoom\'s e1m1 hangar would rather the player have a fun experience over the\r\nexperience of entering an actual space colony.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_018.png\' tl=\'3,8\' br=\'40,13\'%}\r\n\r\n<p>Robojim does capture Doom\'s secret passages however. A conspicuous arrow\r\npoints towards a wall, a straightforward secret further hinted at by the\r\notherwise inaccessible room.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_019.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Pressing against the wall opens the path inside, and also summons a bunch of\r\ndemons, a traditional Doom monster closet.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_021.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Hitting the switch within this hidden room opens up a second path to the room\r\nbelow.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_022.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>This leads to another otherwise inaccessible area on the next board. There\r\nare some health pickups here, but most importantly is a yellow key that\'s\r\nnecessary to complete the game. It also gives a safe vantage point from which\r\nto observe the other enemies on the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_029.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Which is good since the rest of the board is the next place to go. The\r\nenemies here move in pretty quickly and it\'s easy to lose a lot of health like\r\nI did. The health provided in Doom here is a little less than I\'d prefer, but\r\nthe game is very much beatable without using cheats. Ammo meanwhile is much\r\nmore abundant, and just as in id\'s Doom, the former human enemies drop ammo when\r\nkilled.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_030.png\' tl=\'1,17\' br=\'25,25\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>In the corner are some imps shooting over water which I\'m only just now\r\nrealizing is meant to be an open window. Doom for ZZT does use STK colors here\r\nand there, and I think using some specially colored water could probably make\r\nfor a decent illusion of a window compared to ZZT\'s default water. There\'s an\r\nopen gap on the left, and some visible powerups implying there\'s a way to get\r\nin.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_033.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Sure enough, the switch on the board opens up a path to the west, but there\'s\r\nstill something suspicious about those walls on the bottom. One of them has a\r\ndark purple frame around it...</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_034.png\' \'message\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_035.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>And here we have our first actual secret. It\'s entirely optional and only\r\ngives the player some powerups as a reward for their thorough investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The skull is cool and there are some upsidedown crosses. Now it\'s looking\r\nlike Doom.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_036.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Back on the main path, the west room opened up by the switch also contains\r\nnothing more than some more powerups, but with some enemies to fight against\r\nrather than just leaving them for the player\'s taking. Also visible is another\r\nsection of the room with some items. Assuming the game\'s map is euclidean (ZZT\r\ncan have boards connect arbitrarily in any direction), it looks like there\'s\r\na secret in the starting room that hasn\'t been found yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also some satanic upsidedown cross with 6-6-6 written across its\r\npoints! Spooky stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_039.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>A short backtrack to the first room, and the secret entrance is obvious in\r\nhindsight.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_040.png\' tl=\'25,22\' br=\'38,25\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Walking into it even erases the fake walls marking the path for the player.\r\nA single fake gets left behind due to the player standing on top of it when the\r\n#change command erases the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_036.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Oh no, I missed taking a screenshot of the player in the opening room\'s\r\nsecret. It looks just like it did from this earlier screenshot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After collecting the extra health and ammo, the only place left to proceed\r\nis through the yellow door in the second room that leads north.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_041.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The player gets to see some more cool art, with this neat looking rendition\r\nof a demon\'s face. Doom for ZZT is pretty easily forgotten, but its artwork like\r\nthis does stand out. It\'s pretty impressive looking! The various faces and\r\nskulls are the high point of the game honestly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This board also features the player\'s first encounter with two barons of\r\nhell, perhaps as a reference for the pair of barons dubbed the bruiser brothers\r\nthat the player fights at end of id\'s Doom at the end of the first episode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The barons are notably difficult to deal with in Robojim\'s version of Doom,\r\nbut not for the same reasons as in id\'s. Since all projectiles in ZZT so the\r\nsame amount of damage, in order to make them more of a threat these barons move\r\nvery fast. Their speed matches that of the player and they alternate between\r\nmoving towards the player and moving randomly. This 50/50 ratio in movement\r\nleads to them being significantly harder to hit at range, and if they get close\r\nto the player they\'re very difficult to dodge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In ZZT, the player can\'t shoot an object directly adjacent to them, but\r\nobjects can shoot an adjacent player. In practice this means a baron that gets\r\ntoo close will have a large advantage over the player. The barons throughout the\r\ngame thankfully don\'t really appear with other enemies which makes them a bit\r\nmore manageable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They\'re not accurate to the barons of Doom itself, but they are a scary\r\nthreat, definitely matching the boss monster status of their id counterparts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_044.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>In an act of kindness towards the player, they don\'t actually need to be\r\ndefeated. The passage to the north is always open and the player can just run\r\nright past them in a panic if they choose. However, defeating the two of them\r\nopens up a secret passage to the east.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_045.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The player is rewarded with more cool art, and a lot of tigers/imps.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_047.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a fully functional river of slime! Stepping into it causes the\r\nplayer to take damage over time by having some hidden objects check that the\r\nplayer is aligned with them, and thus the columns of green that make up the\r\nriver. It\'s a pretty neat idea, and it makes good use of ZZT\'s flashing colors.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the bottom of the river is another secret passage, hinted at by the wall\r\ntexture changing. In my live playthrough of the game I managed to not find this\r\nbecause I assumed the fake walls were the objects check for player alignment!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_050.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The slime river continues, with a gap to get out and back onto safe ground.\r\nIt does continue to some locked doors, but there\'s no reason for the player to\r\never head the long way down that path since they can see they won\'t be able\r\nto proceed. In an actual Doom map an unknowing player would be more likely to\r\nfollow the river and take extra damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of actual Doom, this is the one board in the game which feels most\r\nlike something that you would see in it. The geometry of alternating crosses\r\nis definitely something I could see being in an official Doom map.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_053.png\' tl=\'1,16\' br=\'51,25\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Here the player has to make their way through the crosses, fighting off\r\nseveral enemies, and collecting the two keys within. The keys blink in and out\r\ndue the selected colors, but aren\'t exactly hard to find.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_055.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Once the second door is opened, a new enemy is summoned. The object is just\r\nnamed demon, and isn\'t listed on the game\'s difficulty selection, but it turns\r\nout to be a pain elemental from Doom 2. It moves around the room, not attacking\r\ndirectly, but instead by summoning lost souls. Just like in Doom 2, it\'s a\r\nvery annoying enemy to fight, and even turns into a ruffian itself when\r\ndestroyed</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_060.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Taking the passage out of the room teleports the player back to the beginning\r\nof the slime river. It places the player where they were last in the room, which\r\nmeans in the middle of the river where they\'ll immediately begin taking damage\r\nagain. Rude.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_062.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>On the other side of the river are more scattered powerups, and a passage\r\nthat leads to the exit switch marking the end of the level. Previously the game\r\nhas been nice enough to group its items together, but here they\'re really just\r\ndropped all over the place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this branch of secrets explored, the only place left to explore is north\r\nof the baron room.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_064.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The board is split up into three different rooms, to the west is a baron\r\nand some passages, the center contains a few paltry demons, and the right is\r\nfull of lost souls. On the player\'s first trip they can just breeze right through\r\nthe middle.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_066.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Up next is a board with some pillars(?) in the middle of the room. Lots of\r\nenemies to fight, and all from ZZT\'s own library of creatures. Perhaps Robojim\r\nnoticed the issues with large quantities of object based enemies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blue and red of this room gives it a look that stands out and looks kind\r\nof nice in my opinion. Surprisingly, despite the circular objects on each\r\npillar, there are no secrets in this room like the player might expect.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_068.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Up ahead is this weird looking room. Object based enemies are back, but in\r\nfar smaller numbers than seen previously which gives them much more of a chance\r\nto actually do their thing rather than immediately shoot their comrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s really difficult to tell what this geometry is supposed to be, weird\r\npatterns of line walls strewn about, but there individual squares of line walls\r\nlead me to believe they\'re supposed to be crates. I\'ve got no explanation for\r\nwhy some of them have dark red backgrounds in portions. Bloodstains?</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_071.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Walking against the one square of whatever these things are supposed to be\r\nreveals a hidden switch, hinted at by the rectangle being solid purple rather\r\nthan made of line walls like all the others.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_072.png\' tl=\'46,15\' br=\'60,25\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Hitting the switch causes the corner to open up, exposing the entrance to the\r\nlast secret room.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_073.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Which makes me think of Starbursts. This room only has a few medkits for the\r\nplayer, and another crucifix. Maybe with a face on it? I can\'t really tell what\r\nis going on here. There\'s also an energizer the player can pick up which gives\r\nthem enough time to grab the medkits and leave. There isn\'t really any need for\r\nthe player to stick around and shoot everything here.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_074.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Back on the main path is this purple room with a large wall dividing it into\r\ntwo halves. There\'s a pile of objects on the right who promptly shoot each other\r\nto pieces while I work on shooting the lions on the left.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_075.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Half of them are dead before I even start shooting in their direction. They\r\njust don\'t work well as enemies. Several of the enemies in the lower half of the\r\nroom have begun working up into the top half as well, making it wise to just\r\nhead through the left exist rather than working my way through them.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_076.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, the game\'s map connects properly and I\'m back here. There are\r\nsome lost souls to be shot, and a switch to hit, but that\'s all there is to it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitting the switch opens up the purple normals in the leftmost room on the\r\nboard.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_079.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>One advantage of wrapping around the boards like this is that if the player\r\nisn\'t on a board, it\'s frozen in time, making it easy to flank with from the\r\nother passageway. It\'s easy to hug the wall and get enemies to do the same\r\nmaking them easy targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once most of the enemies have been defeated, I head into the passage in the\r\ncorner, which I suppose would be a teleporter within the context of Doom.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_081.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the teleporter puts the player in a nasty position, directly\r\nnext to a baron of hell. Since the baron tries to get to the player regardless\r\nof which area on the board they\'re in, they\'ll likely make their way to this\r\ncorner when the player moves to press the switch in the green room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a frantic chase as I try to get enough space to begin fighting this\r\nlast baron.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_083.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, I do so, but at the cost of all my remaining ammo. To be fair to\r\nRobojim, there\'s lot of ammo I just plain skipped by being lazy, and having done\r\na live playthrough earlier I was expecting to be able to get away with being a\r\nbit wasteful with my ammo.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_085.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, having that earlier playthrough means I know there\'s no need to\r\nturn around for more as the last passage leads to the exit!</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/doom/zzt_088.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Hitting the final switch ends the game, and reveals that your torches\r\nrepresent the percentage of secret rooms visited. As mentioned earlier, level\r\none is the final level.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Doom for ZZT feels like the definition of mediocre. It feels incredibly by\r\nthe numbers and generic. Making a ZZT game that feels like Doom may be an\r\nimpossible task, so it\'s no surprise that this game doesn\'t feel like Doom. It\r\ndoesn\'t feel like much of anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of games out there based on a license that don\'t do anything\r\nwith the source material, but put on a coat of paint with the source material\'s\r\nbranding and call it a day. ZZT\'s text graphics mean that a lot of times, even\r\ndoing that little is beyond its reach. Doom for ZZT captures Doom just as well\r\nas it would capture Quake or Call of Duty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time unlike other ZZT games that are conversions or\r\nreinterpretations of other media, I can\'t really fault it for doing a poor job.\r\nThe <a href=\"https://pokyfriends.com/blog/22/closer-look-zem-and-zem-2\" target=\"_blank\">Zem games</a>\r\ncovered months ago took the concept of Lemmings and worked it into ZZT\'s limits\r\nbecause ZZT\'s limits can still handle something like Lemmings. Doom for ZZT\r\nbites off more than it can chew and has to compromise so much that it doesn\'t\r\nfeel like the game it\'s trying to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the stranger things about this, when thinking about it, is realizing\r\nthat ZZT would actually be better at replicating more complex FPS titles like\r\nValve\'s Half-Life series. All the issues with a lack of hitscan, enemies\r\nshooting each other constantly, and a lack of varied weaponry would still\r\nremain, but later FPS games do include story through gameplay, and if there\'s\r\none thing ZZT can do, it\'s handle some expository text. At the very least,\r\ntalking to a scientist who says \"You need to open a portal to Xen!\" in a ZZT\r\nHalf-Life would be able to give the player something they can point at to say\r\nwhat makes the game a Half-Life game. Doom\'s lack of a focus on its story works\r\nfor it just fine when there\'s quality level design and excellent action. ZZT\'s\r\nDoom takes out too much and offers no real replacement or innovation of its own.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has some nice artwork, the title screen is a very good rendition of the\r\nlogo, and while doing the live stream everybody was excited to see a new drawing\r\nof a demon face show up, but nobody was clamoring for more rooms with ruffians\r\nand tigers running around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s hard to say how to fix Doom for ZZT. Tightly constrained rooms could\r\nmake encounters a bit more tense, and prevent the player from idly waiting for\r\nenemies to kill each other sure, but that wouldn\'t be enough to make Robojim\'s\r\nDoom rise above being a bland action game. It\'s easy to imagine Doom for ZZT\r\nbeing much worse, but it\'s really difficult to find a way to make it that much\r\nbetter.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of\r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2017-03-21',1,'django',1,NULL,'articles/cl/doom/preview.png','You\'re trying to say you like DOS better than me, right?'),(215,'Closer Look: Burglar!','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get Burglar!?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Burglar! is available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=burglar!.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>\r\nas well as playable in browser via <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/zzt_burglar\" target=\"_blank\">Archive.org</a>.\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also explore the world yourself on the\r\n<a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/file/b/burglar!.zip?file=burglar1.zzt&board=0\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of ZZT Public Beta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_000.png\' %}\r\n<h2>Burglar!</h2>\r\n<div class=\"c\">\r\nBy: MadTom<br>\r\n<!--Published Under: <br>-->\r\nReleased: Aug. 10, 2002\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Burglar! I\'m not yelling about it, I\'m just writing the exclamation point\r\nincluded in the title. Burglar!! Wow! What a game!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MadTom was a very prominent ZZTer in the mid-2000s and it was the release of\r\nBurglar! which brought him into the spotlight. There are ZZT worlds which are\r\ngood, and there are some which are great, but there are just a tiny few which\r\ntruly excel at creating something unique. Burglar! comes up a lot when asking\r\nZZTers who were around after its release what their favorite ZZT games were, and\r\nfor very good reason. Burglar! is easily one of the most innovative and fun to\r\nplay ZZT worlds ever released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I get everybody too excited, it\'s definitely not perfect. It has\r\nissues that make it less accessible than it could stand to be, and one scene\r\nin particular has aged very poorly when playing it in 2017. There are definitely\r\nmoments where you can tell it was written by a fifteen year old, but the game\r\noverall is still strong enough that it can easily hold its own when compared\r\nto games outside of the confines of ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes some time, and can be punishing if you aren\'t liberal with making\r\nmultiple saves, but whether or not you\'ve grown up playing ZZT, you should\r\nabsolutely try the game out for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all that being said, let\'s begin!</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_001.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Burglar! begins with a solid looking title screen consisting of the game\'s\r\ntitle and a drawing of (what I assume to be) Luke Steel, the game\'s protagonist\r\nwho just so happens to be a burglar. Luke casually flips the coin in his hand\r\nplaying a nice little ASCII animation of it rising and spinning in the air\r\nbefore it lands once again on his finger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just now realized that he\'s not wearing a black mask over his eyes, but\r\nsunglasses. Luke is just that cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the title screen also has a short song looping. MadTom was one\r\nof the dedicated few who came to grips with ZZT\'s crude musical capabilities and\r\nproduced a lot of great music for his games as well as for others (perhaps\r\nmost notably, the soundtrack used in Zenith Nadir\'s <a href=\"https://z2.pokyfriends.com/search?author=Zenith%20Nadir&title=Frost\" target=\"_blank\">Frost</a>\r\nseries). The music here is a bit cheerful for the game\'s tone, but it sounds\r\nnice and is worth a listen and a good excuse to check out the coin animation as well:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzNYEQS3rCU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>One last point of interest is the [ FILE ONE ] in the corner. ZZT\'s limited\r\nboard size (roughly 20 kilobytes) and world size (300 or so) meant that larger,\r\nmore complex games would be split across several files. Burglar is maybe 50\r\nboards in total, but broken into two pieces to ensure ZZT doesn\'t run the risk\r\nof crashing during play.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_002.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Upon pressing P to play, the player is taken to an interactive menu with an\r\nunmasked Luke pointing a gun at the menu itself. The menu comes off as more of a\r\nformality if anything. A large number of ZZT worlds start off on menus rather\r\nthan jumping straight into the game. The about section contains a list of\r\nMadTom\'s previous ZZT releases, the forthcoming says that he\'s got more in the\r\nworks but won\'t name specifics, and the credits is mostly just the usual list\r\nof titles all credited to MadTom other than the beta testers.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_011.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>It also includes shoutouts in the form of IRC logs. This one here is the best\r\nof them.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_014.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The game begins proper with Luke walking along the street, though he\'ll be\r\ninterrupted with the game\'s introduction very quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}@ ░▒▓ BURGLAR! ▓▒░\r\n\r\n$░▒▓ WELCOME TO BURGLAR! ▓▒░\r\n\r\n$  Story and Introduction\r\n  You are Luke Steel, an experienced\r\nburglar, thief, pickpocket, and all-\r\n-around badass. You arrived here in\r\nthe larger city of Foddah about three\r\ndays ago, and some drunk dude in the bar\r\nhanded you a card for some kind of\r\norganized `burgle-to-order\' society,\r\nbased at BAGLARR AND SONS in the South\r\nside of town. Your first meeting with The\r\nBoss was successful; in fact, it being\r\n9.30pm, you are now going to receive\r\nyour first order; hell, the pay\'s good,\r\nand you know where your next meal\'s\r\ngonna come from ...\r\n\r\n$  How to Play\r\n  The game\'s inventory based. Before you\r\nleave on each of your missions, you will\r\nbe sent to an inventory room to pick up\r\nwhat you think you will need. Choose\r\ncarefully; certain items may be essential\r\nto successfully burglaring the ordered\r\nlocation, while others may be utterly\r\nuseless. To see inventory, type ?+i.\r\n  You will be given a brief summary of\r\nthe place you are commanded to burgle\r\nbefore you leave. If you\'re discovered,\r\nhey, man, this is the big city, you\'re\r\neither in the slammer or more likely\r\ndead, and the society won\'t acknowledge\r\nyour existence. Worth the $1000 a night,\r\nya reckon?\r\n  I know instant kills aren\'t popular,\r\nbut for a dangerous profession like\r\nburglary, I feel it\'s necessary.\r\n\r\n  BIG TIP: DON\'T save when you\'re\r\nactually ON a burglary board. My\r\nrecommendation would be to save just\r\nbefore you select your equipment.\r\n\r\n  \'Sall. Enjoy, you badass, you.\r\n\r\n{% endscroll %}\r\n\r\n<p>Right away there\'s a lot to take in. The conceit of the game is a little\r\nstrange. You\'re a hired burglar? The city\'s whole network of criminals is based\r\naround this front company and you\'ll be paid to steal stuff. Not on the level of\r\nbank robberies or anything, but somebody out there is paying Luke very good\r\nmoney to go to a specific address, and take a VCR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burglar!\'s writing takes on a lot of ego-building for Luke. It\'ll often come\r\noff as teenage power fantasy, to be this cool collected badass who has no fear\r\nof danger and is irresistible to women. The framing of everything isn\'t the\r\nmost compelling, but the actions the player gets to take are how the game hooks\r\nyou.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the scroll says, Luke will have an inventory of equipment to help in\r\nhis burglaries, and that failures are an instant game over. MadTom suggests\r\nsaving only when it\'s safe, and not during burglaries, but in practice that\r\nwould become very frustrating to do rather than make new saves constantly. It\'s\r\na bit too easy to lose progress, but I\'ll get to that when it\'s more relevant.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_021.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>On the streets is a sleeping man who looks just like Luke, and a \"psycho\r\ndude\" whose watch can be stolen. Luke is shameless and never shows any doubts\r\nor has any morals getting in the way of making a quick buck. Again, it\'s a power\r\nfantasy kind of game, and frankly I don\'t want to imagine a young teen trying\r\nto make the game into a drama over the ethics of theft. Luke\'s a burglar. You\'re\r\nplaying as Luke. Go burgle.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_025.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The front lobby contains a guard, and the player can see into the next room\r\nwith a few more people. MadTom added a bit of visual flair with the abstract\r\nbackground rather than opting to have the rest of the room match the brown\r\nwalls or just have it floating in a black void. This is a simple visual\r\nflourish, but throughout the game MadTom will make the most of the space\r\nprovided. To get into the building, Luke needs to first get past a security\r\nguard.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_026.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_027.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Power fantasy. There are no consequences for this, and flashing the card\r\nfor the business lets the player in just the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the injured guard, there\'s a bit to explore here.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_030.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The first chair I looked at to see if the chairs had a message had 20 dollars\r\non it.

Simple stuff, an empty house with a basic\r\nsecurity system. Nothing the sunglasses at night wearing badass Luke Steel can\'t\r\nhandle.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_055.png\' tl=\"8,15\" br=\"51,25\" %}\r\n\r\n<p>The equipment room offers a selection of useful tools Luke can bring with him\r\nonto each burglary, but only three of them can be carried. So let\'s take a look\r\nfrom left to right of the eight available options.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>A pistol with 20 bullets</li>\r\n    <li>A grappling hook with 50 feet of rope</li>\r\n    <li>A flash pellet to temporarily blind somebody</li>\r\n    <li>A sticky goo adhesive that dries almost instantly</li>\r\n    <li>A Pokémon card somebody left on the rack</li>\r\n    <li>A pair of pliers</li>\r\n    <li>A set of lockpicks</li>\r\n    <li>An electromagnetic disruptor to break small alarm systems</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>So what would you take? Check the briefing again if you\'re unsure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you choose the lock picks, disruptor, and gun? If so, congrats, you can\r\nrob the house and get some optional items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did your selection not include both the lock picks and disruptor? Whoops!\r\nYou\'re destined to fail and will be unable to proceed with the game. Reload your\r\nsave now. The all or nothing approach to Burglar! is what prevented me from\r\nenjoying it when it was a new release, but though it\'s got some very punishing\r\ndesign it is at least something that can be worked around. MadTom was at least\r\nkind enough to include the correct equipment choices in the game\'s text file.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some other weird quality of life issues here as well. If you pick\r\nup three items and go to another one it tells you that you\'re carrying too much\r\nalready, which is fine, but it doesn\'t pop up the description of the item so\r\nyou won\'t even know what you\'re missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More of a pain is the fact that despite the objects for each item not\r\ndisappearing once picked up, you can\'t touch them again and opt to put them\r\nback down. If you\'re trying to play without using the provided solutions, it\'s\r\ncritical to make a save before picking any equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once everything\'s been taken, the player can talk to the person in blue who\r\nwill open the door to progress to the first mission.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_067.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_068.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>And now onto the meat of the game. Missions are presented as single boards\r\nlike this one where it\'s up to the player to figure out how to get inside and\r\ntake everything that could be of value.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_072.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>First thing to do is activate your disruptor to disable the home\'s alarm. You\r\ncan trip it if you move more than a few tiles into the home where the tiny\r\nblinking red dots on brown are.

Luke can keep on picking any locks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first mission contains more than just a pair of earrings and a VCR,\r\nthough they were all I could get. The TV was too big to carry, and the garage\r\ndoor was dead-bolted preventing access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What this mission does well though, is tying everything together. The player\r\ncan shoot the lock off the garage door (but only after closing the front door to\r\nhelp muffle the noise!) and then load the TV into the car, hotwire it, and drive\r\naway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The optional items are probably handled best in this mission. Most missions\r\nunfortunately require all three items to be able to complete them, which leaves\r\nno room for error and mostly turns collecting items to steal into a matter of\r\nfinding out how to get the player next to them to snag them. Still, it\'s a nice\r\nintroduction to the game and how it works. The first mission is more of a\r\ntutorial if anything where the only danger comes from the player\'s lack of\r\nforesight.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_089.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_090.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_091.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Back at Baglarr\'s, the player can now interact with the bursar to pawn off\r\ntheir stolen goods and make some more cash. The earrings sell for $100, the TV\r\n$500, and the Mitsubishi Lancer, $5,000. The VCR, and all future target items\r\nare never mentioned again, presumably going to the boss, who has a client who\r\nasked for this specific VCR to be stolen in the year 2001. (Here\'s a <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/WNnJp\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy ad\r\nfrom 2002</a> that sells DVD players for $60-180. Perhaps a DVR would\'ve been a more\r\nvaluable item to use instead.)</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_093.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to selling stolen goods to the bursar, the player can also\r\npurchase flashlight batteries represented by torches. This is essential (and\r\nthe game even tells you as much) that many missions will be dark. I opted to\r\npurchase ten of them which was plenty. There\'s no need for money for anything\r\nelse so it\'s quite easy to afford them as needed.</p>\r\n\r\n{% scroll %}@computer\r\n\r\n  \"Very well done, Mr. Steel.\"\r\n\r\n$  \"Why, thank you.

But it\'s\r\na LITTLE BIT SPOILED BY THE CONTEXT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a lot to take in here. Burglar! has stellar reviews, and not one of\r\nthem mentions this scene. It\'s a good example on how the discussion of sex in\r\nvideo games has changed over the last decade. This scene apparently didn\'t bat\r\nan eye in a community of teenage boys, but it\'s mind blowing to see today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MadTom was very much known within the community as somebody who was a bit\r\nprissy, and so to see content like this from him is genuinely unexpected. I\'m\r\nsure the justification back then was the \"well it\'s not like Luke\'s _attacking_\r\nher\". It\'s just like the also super gross scene in Revenge of the Nerds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most ZZT sexuality is crude humor, probably most notably in Draco\'s\r\nTeen Priest series which has a few sex scenes, but (at least I hope my memory\r\nis correct) those were always consensual! But Luke Steel is a power fantasy\r\nand that means he has to get with beautiful women at all times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today this scene is a huge blight on what\'s otherwise, excusably flawed with\r\nits portrayals of women. There\'s dumb horny teenage boy writing his cool black\r\neyed sunglasses wearing protagonist who women can\'t help be attracted to, and\r\nthen there\'s very much a crossed line here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s gross. It\'s bad. It\'s very unexpected (and I am certain MadTom would\r\nbe mortified to see it again). The good news is that there\'s nothing else\r\nlike this for the rest of the game, and it just returns to it\'s usual banter of\r\nLuke saying something and winking and the women giggling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\'s move on from this.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_379.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Here\'s one of the books from earlier!</p>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"m6end\"></span>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_420.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>In the bedroom, Luke can find the necklace that was requested.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_421.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately for him, after opening the door to make an exit the boyfriend\r\nbegins to wake up.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/burglar/zzt_423.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>This is a good example of not knowing where you need to be to use an item.

Burglar II, unfortunately never happened. Luke\'s story\r\ndraws to a close.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Burglar! is easily one of the most well made ZZT worlds out there. It creates\r\na style of gameplay unlike anything else out there for ZZT, and even outside of\r\nZZT the number of games to compare it to are pretty slim (the Thief series would\r\nmake the most sense). MadTom managed to create a game that plays very well with\r\nZZT\'s limited mechanics in such a way that it feels like you\'re playing something\r\nmore than a ZZT game. It\'s very difficult to make something in ZZT that doesn\'t\r\nfeel like it had to be scaled back to work. Burglar! feels uncompromised.\r\nThere\'s no exposed wiring where the game has to warn the player that if they\r\naren\'t delicate things will break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coding is excellent, each location burgled feels different enough from\r\nthe others and does a good job of keeping the player on their toes. Mission 2\r\nwith the child calling for his mother and the mother getting a drink work\r\nparticularly well at making sure that the player never feels safe committing\r\ntheir crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second file of the game does even better. The pick pocketing sequence\r\ndraws on a little bit too long, but gives a sense of an open and busy world.\r\nThere\'s a lot of life in the streets and overall it\'s a lot of fun to go\r\nthrough the sequence. It\'s hampered by its strict requirements, but as a\r\nplayground of people to try and con it\'s very fun to play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there\'s the police station finale. It is very difficult to create tension\r\nin a ZZT game. Everything is smiling and there\'s usually very little feedback on\r\nthe situation through gameplay. Writing works for this, but then you\'re simply\r\ntelling the player how to feel and breaking the flow of gameplay. The police\r\nrobbery is genuinely intense to play, sticks to brief snips of exposition, and\r\nuses the fade-ins of new rooms to create a sense of unease. You don\'t know what\r\nyou\'ll be up against next, and there\'s no fumbling with torches and limited\r\nviews of what the player can currently see. I feel like making the police\r\nstation require torches would\'ve significantly reduced its impact. The room by\r\nroom exploration does a much better job of restricting the player\'s vision of\r\nthe entire board and allows them to see things at the end of a hallway that\r\nwould be out of a torch\'s limited range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are still some issues, but most of them can be mitigated with frequent\r\nsaves or are more suggestions for improvement than problems with the game as it\r\nis. Selecting equipment for missions is very punishing for wrong choices, and\r\noften prevents them from being beatable. The game does an adequate job of\r\nhinting at them, and is kind enough to explicitly list them in the game\'s text\r\nfile so it\'s not as bad as it could be. Burglar!\'s equipment feels like it\r\nwould have been better if there were alternate solutions for its puzzles, with\r\ndifferent items being accessible depending on what was brought along. Lockpicks\r\nprobably should\'ve just been an innate item the player always has as they\'re\r\nmandatory to complete five of the game\'s six missions where equipment is\r\nchosen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One aspect where ZZT\'s limitations do sneak up on the player is in how little\r\nthere actually is to steal! This is an issue with ZZT\'s 10 flag limit and at\r\nany time 3 are used for equipment, and one for the ?+i inventory engine to use\r\nsaid equipment. This leaves 6 more, but the game also has to track which mission\r\nthe player is currently on, and flags also get used for tracking states like\r\nhiding behind furniture. This all comes from the fact that the items manually\r\nneed to be sold to the bursar after each mission. The 4th mission done with a\r\npartner gets around this by having envelopes of cash that just immediately give\r\nmoney, and I think immediately receiving the cash could\'ve meant more to take.\r\nBarjesse\'s Nightmare used a crude way of compressing flags in groups of four\r\nwhich could\'ve also been used here as well to track what\'s been stolen without\r\nwasting one flag per item.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there\'s the 6th mission which wound up needed a content warning. That\r\npart is pretty uh, bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end though, Burglar feels incredibly cohesive, and well made. It\'s\r\none of the more professional feeling ZZT worlds out there barring its writing.\r\nIts strengths lie in its variety. Burglarizing, pickpocketing, and safecracking\r\nall come into play throughout the game. It would\'ve been easy to make a game\r\nabout robbing homes where you just dodge alarms and pick up items, and something\r\nlike that would\'ve felt like what you\'d expect from a ZZT game just called\r\nBurglar!, but MadTom really went above and beyond and created an experience that\r\nis truly memorable and easily makes it one of ZZT\"s finest.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of\r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2017-03-31',1,'django',4,215,'',''),(219,'Closer Look: ZIG','Dr. Dos','Closer Look','<h2>Where can I get ZIG?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG and its associated worlds are available on <a href=\"http://zzt.org/?p=database&search=zig21a.zip\" target=\"_blank\">z2</a>, but there\'s no way to just browse ZIG worlds there!\r\nZIG isn\'t hosted on the Internet Archive\'s MS-DOS collection either.

The month started off with\r\na livestream of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6VljA7WSSM\" target=\"_blank\">\r\nSuper ZZT\'s Monster Zoo</a>, and it\'s going to keep going for pretty much the\r\nentire month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT was released in 1991, and as anybody will tell you, it was pretty\r\noutdated from the start. Super ZZT shuffled things around a bit, creating a more\r\naction focused environment with large scrolling boards, and a few enhancements\r\nlike additional flags, a hint system, as well as a much larger array of colors\r\navailable without additional tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most powerful as well as the most (read: only) successful ZZT clone was\r\nAlexis Janson\'s MegaZeux, released in 1994. It kept the 16-color 255-character\r\naesthetics, but brought with it a significantly more powerful language known as\r\nRobotic, customizable board sizes, support for mod music, mouse support, sprites,\r\nand a whole slew of things over the years. It\'s still being developed, one of\r\nthe benefits of its source code having never been lost to time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 90s however, MegaZeux as an alternative to ZZT had a few issues\r\nto overcome. Firstly it was a very picky program, and a lot of people just could\r\nnot manage to get it working with their PCs. Others would suffer from a lack of\r\naudio support or only be able to get the program to run with a forked version\r\nthat removed the program\'s editor entirely to save memory. I was unable to get\r\na fully working copy until the early 2000s, shortly before the first Windows\r\nport became available. So MegaZeux is mostly a blind spot to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, even if you could run MegaZeux, it had its own share of issues\r\nwith creating games. ZZT\'s limitations are a blessing and a curse. MegaZeux\'s\r\nconsiderable freedom in comparison makes it significantly more difficult to\r\nproduce something of quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While all this was going on, ZZT in the late 90s and early 2000s was by\r\ncontrast easy to make something in, but difficult to make what you actually\r\nwanted. When trying to produce your teenage masterpiece in ZZT, you\'d be dealing\r\nwith flag limits, board sizes, PC speaker audio, very restrictive numbers of\r\nobjects, and so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And lo\', Jacob Hammond saw this plight and created this \"ZZT-Inspired Game\r\nCreation System\" that came to be called ZIG.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\"ZIG is a GCS that fills the gap between ZZT and MegaZeux. It has the\r\nsimplicity and ease-of-use of ZZT, but with the power of MegaZeux.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_018.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>A noble premise, and one that would serve the ZZT community well. So let\'s\r\ntake a look at each released ZIG world and figure out why ZIG just never took\r\noff.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ZIG v2.0 demo</h3>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_019.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>We\'ll start off with the program\'s included demo file, showing off several of\r\nthe features ZIG has to offer to put ZZT to shame. Right away things already\r\nlook more advanced than ZZT with these much smoother gradients consisting of\r\nnon-default EGA colors. Some attempts at curves and slants show up in ZIG\'s\r\ndefault character set as well.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_021.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>And it starts on the wrong board.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_030.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Jumping back to the main main menu we get this colorful screen and a not\r\nquite ZZT style sidebar. ZIG\'s sidebar is customizable and items can be added\r\nor removed via its scripting language, XOP. The documentation doesn\'t say what\r\nXOP stands for, but if my memory serves it\'s eXtended Object-oriented\r\nProgramming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also no instance of a \"player\" like ZZT. The player at the keyboard\r\nuses arrow keys and an object is coded to react to them being pressed to\r\nnavigate the menu\'s selections.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_033.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The about section brings up a scroll with no useful information. Super ZZT\r\nfeels rushed and incomplete, but \"close enough\". ZIG is much the same way, but\r\nis explicitly so rather than just a feeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I scroll the text up and down there are some ghosting issues seen with\r\nthe asterisks continuing onto later lines. This will come up a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_034.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_035.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_037.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction looks like something you would see in a MegaZeux game, large\r\ntext fading in and out of the screen, as well as being moved up the screen into\r\nframe by shifting the camera offsets for the board. The sidebar is also gone\r\nin these boards as it can be turned off entirely. It\'s also an intro that takes\r\nplace over multiple boards as objects can trigger a board switch instantly as in\r\nMegaZeux without relying on clunky machinery of duplicators, player clones, and\r\npassages that one would have to use for ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"II\" here refers to this being ZIG version 2.1a.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_038.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The demos section brings up an overview of some of ZIG\'s features that might\r\nbe worth checking out. Here there\'s a standard ZZT player that can be moved\r\ninto the passages.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_039.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The player demo is essentially just showing off ZIG\'s ability to reproduce\r\nbasic ZZT gameplay. There are some scrolls explaining how to move and shoot,\r\nwhich are identical to ZZT\'s controls, and the cyan boulders are in fact boxes\r\nof ammo which act like ZZT\'s ammo.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_045.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Upon rounding the corner the monsters charge towards the player. They\'re\r\nZIG reconstructions of ZZT\'s lions, tigers, and ruffians, but they feel rather\r\noff. We\'ll get into detail as to why that is in the next demo.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_048.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>A few of the monsters lock up entirely and just don\'t move. That\'s all for\r\nthis first demo.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_051.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The second demo is the big reveal. ZIG doesn\'t quite have built-ins like ZZT,\r\nSuper ZZT, and MegaZeux. Nearly everything in ZIG is an object running XOP, with\r\nfew exceptions. Those enemies fought earlier? They were all hand-coded.\r\nEven the player is an object! It\'s completely possible to have up move the\r\nplayer south, or place another object, or anything else really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The demo shows this off with a few objects that modify the player\'s\r\nproperties. Fast speed of increases the player\'s movement speed, confusion\r\ncauses them to move randomly without any input from the player, and racecar\r\nmode forces the player to always move forward with right and left steering them\r\nclockwise and counter-clockwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a second player controlled using the numeric keypad and using\r\nthe 0 key to shoot! We\'ll see a lot of attempts at crude multiplayer using this\r\ntechnique in other ZIG worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_061.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also \"Inventory Land\", demonstrating using keys to access a player\'s\r\ninventory. It\'s a much cleaner solution than ZZT\'s repurposing of its cheat\r\nsystem to set a flag and open an inventory.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_062.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>One of ZIG\'s biggest features (something even more complex than MegaZeux\'s\r\nequivalent) is just casually mentioned by this sign.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_065.png\' tl=\'25,15\' br=\'33,25\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG has a layering system! No longer are all parts of a tree walls for the\r\nplayer to avoid, now they can casually pass behind them, or in front of them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT has only one layer, and elements with stats can keep track of what\r\nthey\'re on top of to prevent fake walls from disappearing when walked over, but\r\nZIG\'s is completely customizable. Each board defaults to 3 layers, with the main\r\nlayer being 2, leaving one foreground and one background, but the number of\r\nlayers can be adjusted, which could be used for some awesome effects in theory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_070.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Smokey the Bear needs some help putting out a camp fire.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_076.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The whole process is straightforward enough, grab the bucket, use bucket on\r\nwater, use filled bucket on camp fire.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_077.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Good job player.

Its audio engine is not a\r\nvery good one. ZIG was notorious back in the day for sound not working for\r\nanybody but Hammond. It should have been a big improvement over ZZT, but instead\r\nZZT\'s PC speaker effects reigned supreme by virtue of working.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_025.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>No sound plays.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_098.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Directional Operators is the title of this demo, and it\'s pretty much all\r\nthe same as ZZT\'s. You\'ve got random movement, cardinal directions, clockwise\r\nand counter-clockwise flow (where a walking object rotates which direction it\r\nwalks in), and of course seek and opp seek for chasing down or escaping from\r\nthe player.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_103.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The seek monster can be let out and hunt down the player, and there\'s also\r\nthis effect that looks like pixel based movement rather than tile based that\'s\r\ndone by manipulating the board\'s character set while it\'s running, shifting\r\nrows of pixels upwards. The effect can be used to handle some simple animations\r\nlike this, but ZIG is still fixed to a grid.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_106.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Flags and variables are next. Flags are on/off values just like in ZZT, but\r\nthere is no set limit on how many are supported. Similarly, there are variables\r\nwhich can be set to integer, decimal, or string values. MegaZeux at the time\r\nhad a limited number of counters, another instance where ZIG actually\r\noutperformed the alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_110.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Our next demonstration is scrolling and viewports.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_113.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>As you\'d expect, the demo consists of a room where only a fraction is visible\r\nat any given time.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_116.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s a vast improvement over ZZT\'s dark rooms, and has the added benefit of\r\nbeing adjustable in code, letting a game dynamically change how much of a board\r\nis visible.

ZZT will play a sound and display a message when\r\nit encounters an error, but afterwards the object just fails to continue\r\nrunning. ZIG offers some alternatives with continuing to execute, stopping\r\nexecution, or ending the game entirely, making things much nicer for debugging.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_122.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Also I gain the ability to move around a a pile of guts. \\m/</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_124.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The final demo is simply miscellaneous.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_127.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Character shifting is shown again, touching the gem causes its character to\r\nshift one pixel horizontally and one vertically.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_135.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>There are some objects on a lower layer, which move randomly but can simply\r\nbe walked over by the player.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_136.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a bridge!</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_137.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>You can go over the bridge.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_139.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>But also you can go under the bridge!</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_140.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_141.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, there\'s an effect where when moving south, rather than fixing the\r\ncamera to the player, it instead pans its way down after the player reaches\r\na certain coordinate. This simulates the behavior seen when going from room to\r\nroom in Zelda game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that\'s all for the demo itself! Before moving onto our next title, let\'s\r\ntake a quick look at the editor.</p>','','2017-04-10',1,'django',1,NULL,'articles/cl/zig/preview.png','ZIG combines ZZT\'s simplicity, MegaZeux\'s power, and Super ZZT\'s lack of interest from the community.

Its code style is very\r\nsimilar to that of ZZT-OOP, with a few instances of adapting usabilty features\r\nfrom MegaZeux. The choice of colors is pretty messy here with comments in a\r\nnearly unreadable black on dark blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see a viewport command for resizing the visible area to a pair of\r\ncoordinates, and commands for manipulating the HUD and assigning some values\r\nto variables. The #addstat command also has the character to show on the HUD\r\nselected by providing a string. In ZZT, the #char command which changes an\r\nobject\'s appearance requires the numeric value for that character which can make\r\ncode hard to read, and requiring lookups to find the number to write in the code\r\nas well. External editors like Kev-Edit offer character selection tools where\r\nusers can select the character they want from a grid and have the editor insert\r\nthe numeric value for them.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_145.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The color selection is the complete range of all 256 possible combination of\r\nforegrounds and backgrounds. High intensity backgrounds are supported rather\r\nthan ZZT\'s unfortunate insistance on blinking allowing for some very vibrant\r\ncombinations not normally possible.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_146.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>I draw some walls, of which the usual solid/normal/breakable/water patterns\r\nare represented. However, any character can be made into a type of wall here.\r\nThis also gives us our first overview of ZIG\'s default character set. Some\r\nASCII characters have been altered to fit in with how they\'ve been used in ZZT\r\nsuch as the club and spade glyphs becoming two sizes of trees. ZZT\'s door\r\ncharacter is very much a door now. There are a lot of different smiley faces\r\ncovering those with bigger eyes, monsters, shocked expressions, and cool dudes\r\nin sunglasses. Plus a few snakes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, ideally ZIG worlds would be editing graphics for their own\r\npurposes, so a lot of what else is included consists of generic building blocks\r\nfor various slopes, curves, and dithering.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_150.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Another feature of ZIG is the ability to highlight blocks and act on them.\r\nThey can be copied and pasted, but it\'s also possible to highlight a region and\r\nupdate everything selected to match the currently selected color or character.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_151.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_153.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m jealous that Kev-Edit doesn\'t have support for the color/tile replacement\r\nfunctionality, but it does have copy/paste as well as support for\r\nnon-rectangular selections.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_154.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The board information lists a good amount of properties, sizes, offsets,\r\nviewports, layers. You can specify a music file to automatically play on the\r\nboard rather than having to make an object for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also a \"controller\" object which is somewhat like MegaZeux\'s global\r\nobject. This is a per-board object whose code runs, but isn\'t actually on the\r\nscreen anywhere. Compared to ZZT\'s habit of leaving the pieces of its engines\r\nscattered into every corner, ZIG provides a more elegant solution.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_155.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Tools for palette editing are built right in, with RGB components being\r\nadjustable sliders from 0-63 for a total of 262,144 possible colors, though\r\nlike ZZT and MegaZeux, only 16 can be displayed at once.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_156.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>I replace red with a sickly zombie looking green and the board updates\r\naccordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_157.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The character editor can be used to manipulate the graphics, and save them\r\nto a file for an object to load again later. It has all the cools you\'d expect\r\nand the luxury of hotkeys to revert characters to both their ZIG default as\r\nwell as their original ASCII display.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_161.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The world can also be modified a bit, allowing the world to have a proper\r\nname rather than ZZT\'s filename display, and setting which board is the title\r\nscreen and which is the starting board. ZZT always sets the board that was\r\nsaved on last as the starting board, and ZIG offers this as a toggle.\r\nGame overs can also be disabled as well if the person making their game wants\r\nto handle it manually, perhaps using a system of extra lives when health is\r\ndepleted.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_162.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG is very well documented at the very least, AKWende is credited with\r\nwriting the manual which is very thorough and does an excellent job going\r\nthrough all its new commands compared to ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can come back to the XOP language at the end, for now let\'s move on to\r\nour next ZIG world which is also included with ZIG itself.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_163.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_164.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_164.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_166.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a simple tech demo of the Interactive Fantasies logo the ZZT/MZX\r\ncompany used at the start of several of their MegaZeux games.

Each\r\nplayer takes turns moving or dropping bombs. These actions take action points\r\nshown on the HUD above. The goal is to kill the other player first.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_183.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Bombs have a fixed timer and you can\'t get very far from them before they\r\nexplode so it looks like it\'s far wiser to drop a bomb before moving rather than\r\nafter.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_187.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>I play around with it a bit, but it\'s not very fun, and I doubt having an\r\nactual second player would do much to improve it. The game\'s controls are\r\nvery slow to react and there\'s a lot of health to burn through. Powerups do\r\nspawn to give bazooka or remote mines, but moving is such a tedious process\r\nthat I wouldn\'t want to chase them down. I think actually playing this would\r\nresult in both players getting within range and than trading blows until whoever\r\nattacked second lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s worth noting however, that though this game works perfectly fine locally\r\nwith two players sitting at a keyboard, it\'s actually designed with online\r\nmultiplayer in mind! Now, ZIG doesn\'t actually have netplay capabilities on its\r\nown, but around this time the ZZT community briefly toyed with the use of a\r\nscreen and keyboard sharing program, Microsoft NetMeeting, to turn these games\r\ninto online experiences. Keep in mind this would be screen sharing in an era\r\nwhere a large number of ZZTers would still be on dial-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NetMeeting was generally proposed as a way for two ZZTers to collaboratively\r\ncreate a ZZT world together (which sounds like a nightmare with two people\r\nsharing the editor), but with ZIG it offered a chance to make games feel that\r\nmuch more modern via crude, laggy, netplay.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_190.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually I let player 1 win the game and it just stops. No indication that\r\nsomebody won, just suddenly the objects can\'t move. There isn\'t even a warp back\r\nto the main menu.

Sidescrollers exist in ZZT and MegaZeux. In ZZT they\'re very\r\nrough as the engine doesn\'t have a lot of the tools you\'d need to make a proper\r\nplatformer. MegaZeux fares better, with its player not needing to touch objects\r\nthat send messages to other objects telling them how to move and jump. More\r\nmodern MegaZeux sidescrollers can use larger sprites to create a more smooth\r\nfeeling experience, but most still use a single tile on the board and feel very\r\nrigid due to sticking to such a low-res grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG should be capable of doing what most basic MegaZeux games did, but this\r\ngame manages to feel worse than sidescrollers in ZZT even. Pressing up jumps,\r\nbut with no horizontal movement at all. I had to look at the game\'s text file\r\nto figure out how to make it up a ledge.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_219.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>To jump horizontally, the player has to hold left/right and then press jump.\r\nThen they\'ll jump straight up just as before, but then take two steps to the\r\nside before they begin their descent. This makes for some incredibly slow jumps\r\nwith no player control over their height or distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The manual says you can press down when you land on an enemy to kill them,\r\nbut I was never even able to time a jump to land on an enemy to begin with.\r\nInstead I\'d wind up alongside them and get hit for one damage.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_221.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>One of the objects managed to push me into solid ground.

Yet\r\ndespite this inspiration, the gameplay doesn\'t even attempt to crib anything\r\nmore than weapons and maps. This one life with a lot of health fighting is very\r\nZZT when ZIG would\'ve been easily able to implement a point based scoring system\r\nwith respawns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, once a player is defeated here the game comes to a stop.

I feel like a secret service\r\nagent would be the one in sunglasses rather than the president, but I guess it\r\nkeeps things consistent with the other maps\' players.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_382.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The president unfortunately immediately sabotages everything by moving me into\r\na corner, trapping the bodyguard and making them unable to leave! This sort of\r\npushing around happens in ZZT as well, but can be prevented by checking if the\r\nobject is next to the player before moving towards them again. This really\r\nsimple technique isn\'t used here making it unplayable, and even more so if the\r\nplayer controlling the bodyguard is the one with a 200ms ping over dialup being\r\nshoved around constantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does make me wonder if these maps were tested online or if the creators\r\nlived nearby and just played on a single keyboard locally.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_386.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The president also shoves their bodyguard into a solid wall.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_499.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_500.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>The main menu also includes information on how to play the game online.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_501.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also some information about the purpose of making this, and a vain\r\nhope to find a program to prevent lag.

Let\'s take a quick look at the commands it adds or modifies from\r\nZZT-OOP:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#addstat name var char</b><br>\r\nThis is how variables are added to the sidebar. Pick a name, a variable to\r\ndisplay, and a character to represent the variable. #delstat can remove a\r\nstat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#become objectname</b><br>\r\nWhile ZZT can have an object become another element, ZIG offers the (not yet\r\nimplemented) ability to transform an object into an object defined in an object\r\nlibrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an included library that for whatever reason wasn\'t recognized by\r\nthe editor, but I do remember it working back when ZIG was a new release. It\r\nincludes recreations of ZZT\'s player, ammo, torches, keys, doors, lions, tigers,\r\nand bears. So people new to ZIG didn\'t have to immediately code a player from\r\nscratch like I would have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#bind objectname</b><br>\r\nZZT\'s #bind can be used to tell an object to discard its own code, and instead\r\npoint to another object\'s. Good for memory, less good when you realize that\r\nmeans #zapping labels like objects that take multiple shots to be destroyed\r\nends up making every single object with that code has its label zapped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG takes a more practical approach in a world where a decent computer may\r\nwell have over 128 megabytes of memory and just copies the code rather than\r\npointing to it. This would be extremely useful for action games which constantly\r\nhit memory issues in ZZT due to not being able to use #bind effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#bindappend objectname</b><br>\r\nThis one appends code onto an existing object.I\'m not sure what the intent with\r\nthis is, but I\'m sure you can be clever with it somehow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#change [color] char [color] char</b><br>\r\nThis command is similar to ZZT\'s but since ZIG only has objects, the match is\r\nbased on the object\'s character. In addition, the colors support can be done\r\nin MegaZeux\'s style of \"cFB\" with a hex number 0-F for the foreground and\r\nbackground, giving it a broader reach over ZZT\'s seven defined color names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#changearea x1 y1 x2 y2 [color] char [color]</b><br>\r\n#change but only to a certain rectangular region on the board!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#char char</b><br>\r\nSame as ZZT, change an object\'s appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#clear/#set flag</b><br>\r\nSame as ZZT, set a boolean flag off or on. ZIG has no restrictions on how many\r\nflags can be defined compared to ZZT\'s 10 however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#clone objectname x y</b><br>\r\nCreates a copy of an object as the given coordinates. In ZZT there is no way\r\nto duplicate an object without waiting for a duplicator to trigger. This could\r\neasily be used for spawning enemies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#color color</b><br>\r\nLike #char, but for an object\'s color. Although ZZT will execute #become red\r\nobject, this causes a new red object to be spawned and the current object\'s\r\ncode to be lost. (Using #put s red object and having a different object try to\r\noverwrite the other does work though? ZZT is weird.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#cycle n</b><br>\r\nSets the object\'s speed. ZIG allows for decimal numbers for more precise control\r\nof speed compared to ZZT where every cycle is ~0.10 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#die</b><br>\r\nDestroys the object, just like ZZT, however ZIG prevents the board\'s last object\r\nfrom dying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#end</b><br>\r\nStops running code! Same as ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#endgame</b><br>\r\nEnds the game\'s execution until the player presses escape. Same as ZZT if you\r\nignore the ability to cheat when dead and bring the player back to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#fade out/restore speed</b><br>\r\nFades the screen to black over speed number of cycles. Having a visual effect\r\nas a single line of code instead of having to mess with palettes makes things a\r\nlot easier. #fade restore will fade back in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#focus</b><br>\r\nSets an object as the focus object. Only one object can be the focus in ZIG,\r\nand that object is the only one that can send :touch messages to other objects\r\nand also is the target referenced when an object tries to #go seek to move\r\ntowards what is most likely the player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#ghost/#solid</b><br>\r\nDisables collision for an object until #solid is used.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#give var amount/#take amount var [label]</b><br>\r\nGives and takes an amount from a variable. This is the same as ZZT and can be\r\nused instead of performing arithmetic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#go dir (or /dir)</b><br>\r\nMoves an object! This is the same as ZZT where the object will try to move in\r\nthat direction endlessly until it succeeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#try dir [label]</b><br>\r\nMoves an object, but gives up if it can\'t. An optional label allows handling a\r\nfailed move. This is the same as ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#walk dir</b><br>\r\nMoves an object endlessly in the given direction. This is the same as ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#idle (or /i)</b><br>\r\nIdles for a cycle. Same as ZZT. The manual here says that a single tick is 0.25\r\nseconds, but that has to be a typo as a cycle there is again, 0.10 seconds. ZIG\r\nfeels about as fast as ZZT normally.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#if (condition/flag) then (command)</b><br>\r\nAllows comparing values and jumping to labels or executing commands like ZZT.\r\nThe lack of elements means comparisons like #if not any lion nolions is no\r\nlonger an option. Similarly, the manual makes no mention of #if contact label\r\nto jump to a label when adjacent to the focus object. This command may actually\r\nbe more versatile in ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#lines 25/43</b><br>\r\nZIG actually supports changing the text mode from a 25 line mode to a 43 line\r\nmode.</p>\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_497.png\' %}\r\n\r\n{% zzt_img \'images/articles/cl/zig/zig_498.png\' %}\r\n\r\n<p>This causes only the top 8 pixels of a character to be rendered, but the same\r\ncharacter set is used. The idea of square characters is a good one, but ZIG\'s\r\nimplementation of it doesn\'t seem very friendly. The manual also warns anybody\r\nwho uses 43 line mode to remember to switch back to 25 when the game ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#loadfont filename.zch</b><br>\r\nLoads a font. This allows for even more dynamic graphics if 256 characters\r\naren\'t enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#loadmod modname.mod</b><br>\r\nLoads and plays a MOD file. If you\'re lucky enough to hear it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#playmod/#pausemod</b><br>\r\nPlays/Pauses the currently loaded MOD file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#move x y [layer]</b><br>\r\nMoves the object to the specified coordinates and layer. Object teleportation\r\nlike this is completely impossible in ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#movetoboard board</b><br>\r\nMoves the object to a different board. ZZT has a player on every board which\r\nis moved around as needed when switching boards, but here you can move anything\r\nanywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#offset x y / auto</b><br>\r\nSets the board\'s view offset for camera panning. Auto centers the view on the\r\nobject that called it. I\'m surprised there isn\'t a command to center it on the\r\nfocus object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#playwav filename</b><br>\r\nMore sound! This time for wav files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#lock/#unlock</b><br>\r\nLocking an object prevents it from receiving external messages until it is\r\nunlocked. This is the same as ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#restart</b><br>\r\nJumps to the beginning of the object\'s code, just like ZZT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#restore/#zap</b><br>\r\nZaps a label, preventing it from being matched next time a label is searched for\r\nlike :touch or :shot. #restore undoes this. In ZZT #restore unzaps every zapped\r\nlabel. The ZIG manual doesn\'t mention if this is still the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#scroll x1 y1 x2 y2 x y</b><br>\r\nNot implemented. This scrolls a section of the board x times horizontally and y\r\ntimes vertically.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#send [(all/all but) / objectname]:]label</b><br>\r\nSends an object to a label like ZZT. #send dance will send the executing object\r\nto :dance. #send frank:dance will send any object named frank to :dance. #send\r\nall:dance will send every object to :dance. ZZT has all of these as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG adds #send all but frank:dance where every object except for frank would\r\njump to :dance. ZZT has #send others:dance where every object excluding the one\r\nthat called the command makes the jump. I\'m not sure why ZIG doesn\'t implement\r\nthis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#shiftchar c x y</b><br>\r\nShifts a character x pixels vertically and y horizontally. This was shown in the\r\ndemo with the gem.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#sidebar 1/0</b><br>\r\nToggles whether the sidebar is displayed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#transport board / #transportfocus board</b><br>\r\nChanges the board that\'s rendered. This can optionally transport the focus\r\nobject as well. Contrast with #movetoboard which would move an object, but keep\r\nthe current board on screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#viewport x1 y1 x2 y2</b><br>\r\nSets a rectangle for the visible potion of the screen to be rendered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>#vislayers a b c...</b><br>\r\nToggles visibility of layers on or off. Something like the \"Galshina\" text in\r\nAelk\'s cutscene could have been on their own layer and then hidden to show more\r\nof the town underneath with this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\'s all of ZIG\'s commands in XOP, but there are still some more features\r\nwith variables. Some of them are read-only, but the author can create more which\r\ncan be modified</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>%me.x / %me.y / %me.layer / %me.char / %me.color</b><br>\r\nThese return the relevant values of an object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>%curboard</b><br>\r\nThis returns the number of the board that is currently loaded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>%prop1 - 4</b><br>\r\nZIG\'s object libraries allow authors to define custom parameters to be filled in\r\nwhich use these four variables. Similar to ZZT\'s settings for enemies like\r\nintelligence or firing rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>%mess.x / %mess.y / %mess.color / %mess.time</b><br>\r\nUnlike ZZT\'s messages which always appear as color changing text along the\r\nboard\'s bottom row, ZIG\'s can be moved around. %mess.time is left unexplained\r\nbut presumably is how long the message stays on screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Custom variables can be simply defined with the %name syntax, and these can\r\nbe referenced by the HUD or other objects. There\'s no mention of variable scope\r\nso I\'d assume any user variable is global compared to MegaZeux where variables\r\ncan be local if necessary.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, there are a few operators. Interestingly, the first one is \"alligned\"\r\nwith two l\'s, matching the typo in ZZT-OOP but no support for \"aligned\". To be\r\nfair, I didn\'t know aligned only had a single l for years after discovering ZZT\r\nso perhaps Jacob Hammond had the same issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s also keyb key which is how custom controls are handled. An object\r\nloops and checks for things like #if keyb m missiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s a not operator for inversing values, blocked for checking if an\r\nobject has anything next to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>rnd # can be used to generate random integers, something miles beyond ZZT\'s\r\nawful hacks for attempting randomness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are the basic arithmetic operators, +, -, *, /, &gt;, &lt;, and = for\r\nmaking comparisons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the most notable one is getobjname dir, which can be combined with\r\n#send to send a message to an adjacent object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The XOP language offers quite a bit of options to those willing to work with\r\nit. It\'s not as accessible as ZZT, but is still simple enough that I feel like\r\na child could pick up the essentials at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG has a lot of tools, and while what\'s there is miles beyond anything ZZT\r\ncan do, it just never went anywhere. Its core concept of being an in between of\r\nMegaZeux\'s power and ZZT\'s simplicity was a sound one. That\'s a niche that\r\ncertainly had merit in the early 2000s. At the time, MegaZeux was difficult to\r\nrun and ZZT had essentially peaked in terms of new mechanics to exploit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG had a few tricks up its sleeve to boost its chances of success. ZIG games\r\nwere permitted to be uploaded to z2 meaning that any releases would get put on\r\nthe front page. There was a continual exposure to ZIG in the ZZT community.\r\n(It\'s also for the best since it makes ZIG easily the best preserved failed ZZT\r\nclone of which there were many.) If you were a ZZTer at the time, you were\r\nexposed to ZIG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG\'s issues weren\'t as severe at the time as well. Releasing MS-DOS programs\r\nin the 21st century was an odd choice, but it worked. Mainstream gaming may\r\nhave been releasing titles solely for Windows, but as long as Windows had its\r\nMS-DOS compatibility, ZIG was safe. Had ZIG been more successful, ports outside\r\nof MS-DOS would have become essential just a few years down the line, but with\r\nits source code available, it would have been \"easy\", at least compared to ZZT\r\nwhere you\'re working with a disassembly or just eyeballing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, ZIG was unable to overcome its shortcomings from a lack of save\r\nsupport and notoriously broken audio support. This definitely slowed its adoption\r\nfrom the very beginning and no saves is probably the single biggest strike\r\nagainst ZIG. ZZT games of the era were longer and more story driven worlds\r\nwhere having to start from scratch every time. The lack of saves\' influence can\r\nbe seen in what ZIG worlds were released. Everything is tailored towards being\r\nshort and direct games. Arcadey dungeon crawls and horrible platformers whereas\r\nAelk\'s Zelda-like inspiration is the exception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG also never took off with the big names at the time. Most of the authors\r\nof ZIG\'s games were ZZTers that nobody really thought twice about when it came\r\nto their releases. That so many of ZIG\'s games aren\'t fun to play didn\'t do them\r\nany favors either. A considerable number of ZIG games are focused on online\r\nmultiplayer, something ZIG wasn\'t designed for, taking advantage instead of\r\nscreen and keyboard sharing as some loophole to crudely pull it off. Aelk and\r\nDysan\'s Temple are the only ZIG games that really feel like they were created\r\nto work with what ZIG offered rather than shoehorn a gameplay mechanic into ZIG.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZZT as a medium was always about compromising and working with and around its\r\ndesigned limitations. It works because people quickly learn to expect that\r\nsort of thing. To an outsider, surrounding a player with objects, which then\r\nsend a message to another object to control comes off as bizarre, but it\'s what\r\noften needs to be done in ZZT. Torches representing clips of ammunition or gems\r\nbeing used as magic points involves the person at the keyboard accepting these\r\nthings the way one accepts the scenery in a play. It\'s obviously a masquerade,\r\nbut there\'s an agreement to go along with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG meanwhile gives the programmer a chance to do away with all that, the\r\nobject in a platformer jumping and falling from gravity really is the object\r\ncontrolled by the player. The sidebar can say clips or magic. The need for\r\nconstant compromise is greatly subdued, but instead all these online games are\r\nimmediately going back to requiring compromise with the nature of lag and the\r\nillusion that your ZIG.EXE file is in fact a deathmatch sever. You can still\r\nplay along with these conceits, but the whole point of ZIG is that it\'s supposed\r\nto stop players from having to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ZIG was a good idea, and honestly one that was well executed for what it was\r\ntrying to do. In the end, what ZIG actually could do and what people wanted\r\nto do with ZIG just weren\'t compatible.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"patreon\">\r\n    The Closer Looks series is a part of the Worlds of ZZT project, committed to\r\n    the preservation of ZZT and its history which sometimes isn\'t actually ZZT\r\n    at all.<br>\r\n    <a href=\"https://patreon.com/worldsofzzt\" target=\"_blank\">Support Worlds of\r\n    ZZT on Patreon!</a>\r\n</div>','','2017-04-10',1,'django',6,219,'','');

INSERT INTO `z2_site_review` VALUES (1,'The Mercenary','Master Tonberry','Dance_Bemani@hotmail.com','I have to say, I really enjoyed playing this game. The relic system really enhanced the game to its fullest potential. And the lvl system was the best I\'ve seen in a long time. Was it just me, or did this game seem to have a remnant of Anthony Testa\'s games? When I first started playing this, I realized how much his games and this game had in common. I\'m probably gonna get flamed for this, but, I thought this game seemed a little better than, say Dungeon Master Gallery. I really, really, really, liked the weapon system. Probably the one thing I didn\'t like was the name; it didn\'t seem to fit the game.',4,'2002-08-29','',1106),(2,'The Mercenary','Fishfood','misanthropyrules@hotmail.com','It\'s diablo 2, for ZZT. It\'s been done before, yes, but this time it\'s actually playable. Let\'s start with the good. The levels are well designed, have a good balance of gameplay, and the programming for the level system is pretty good. The relic system gave the game a good touch on non-linearity. Nowhere near enough to want to play the game twice of course, but it still added another level to an otherwise shawllow concept.\n\nHowever, the graphics are pretty simple fading shades, and don\'t seem to really fit the game very well. It plays much more like an oldschool game in the respect it doesn\'t actually seem to have any reasoning or plot behind it, just the random touching of objects to advance to the next level, then touching more objects and so on so on.\n\nIt\'s all very well if you\'re playing diablo when you can at least have fun equipping your character with random stuff and looking at pretty graphics, but in this game, you don\'t have either, which just makes it seem very simple, and shallow. Maybe one day someone will make a game just like this, only intersperse it with towns, and a plot? Something to give people a reason to play on other than stats.\n\nOther than the lack of any proper reason to be killing these things in the first place and the confusing name, Mercenary is a pretty good game. Nice programming and good idea, but the execution does leave a LOT to be desired. Still, something to build on.',3,'2002-08-29','',1106),(3,'Nightmare','John W Wells','kokolhe1@yahoo.com','Nightmare, by the author of the excellent ZZT Syndromes, is a solid puzzle game with cleverly designed obstacles and passable writing. Aside from being a good few hours of fun, it offers proof that older ZZT games did not necessarily involve yellow borders, pre-generated monsters, and laughable dialogue.\n\nA few minor puzzles, such as the multiple choice riddles, seemed tacked-on, but most are competent and challenging, and easily surpass the gameplay of the majority of recent releases. Oh... and don\'t cheat. Barjesse doesn\'t like that, and it won\'t help much, anyway.\n\nPros: Excellent puzzles, good overall design, good visuals for its time\nCons: Somewhat trite plot.',5,'2002-08-29','',809),(4,'Nightmare','Benco','ZukiGamagachi@hotmail.com','his game is, hands down, one of my favorite zzt games of all time.

There simple aren\'t enough games like this being made today. Games this clever, this well thought out and this thought provoking.

Definetly download this game or else!',5,'2002-08-29','',809),(6,'The Rose','John W Wells','kokolhe1@yahoo.com','\"The Rose\" is a unique game. Whatever its flaws, it\'s a unique game.\n\nBased on a dream, which was apparently influenced by the author\'s daily life, television viewing habits, and general oddness, \"The Rose\" manages to maintain a coherent, but utterly surreal, plot, a story of superheroes and heated chains covered in Drano, of schoolyard friendships and bank robberies.\n\nThe gameplay - what there is of it - generally consists of walking through passages to view cutscenes. A bit of actual play occasionally pops up to spice things up, but this is only an interactive movie in the loosest definition of the word \"interactive.\" There are almost no choices, and there is only one ending.\n\nThat ending is sentimental, clumsily written (\"every rose has is thorn\"), and oddly haunting - much like the rest of the game. The music is probably the key factor here - it\'s probably the most effective thing in the game.\n\nIs \"The Rose\" worth playing? Yes. Is it the best game out there? Not by far.\n\nIs it good?\n\nI guess it depends on your tastes.',4,'2002-08-29','',1204),(7,'Dry Gulch SE','John W Wells','kokolhe1@yahoo.com','As I began to play \"Dry Gulch SE,\" I saw the opening text and thought, \"this is promising.\" The graphics and writing evoked a fine Spaghetti Western atmosphere, and the opening - a lone stranger wanders into a dying town in the Old West - was right on target. It\'s all been done many times, of course, but the reason for this is that the setup is simple, streamlined, and effective.\n\nUnfortunately, the game collapsed soon after its promising beginning. The interiors were clearly not reworked the way the exteriors were, resulting in a stark contrast between dry, dusty desert scenes and sterile buildings, and the plotline, such as it was, didn\'t go anywhere. The only apparent goal was to wander the desert and try to leave, and there was no real hint about how to do even THAT. As it turns out, the sole barrier to exit disappears magically once you accomplish certain tasks.\n\nThere are a few strong moments, but the game design commits three terrible errors, in addition to its aimlessness:\n\n1: At one point, the player is given infinite torches, ammo, and gems. Later, said player is expected to _care_ when he finds a treasure trove of gems.\n\n2: One character tells the player to keep to the honest path unless sure of himself and the morality of his actions. Later, it is necessary to contradict this advice and do something amoral (at best) to advance, unless I missed something.\n\n3: The ending makes no sense. Again, unless I missed something, it came out of nowhere.\n\nDry Gulch SE isn\'t a terrible game, and it is pretty short, so it\'s probably worth your time. The exteriors are good, and the whole package isn\'t bad for a remake. Just don\'t let the introduction get your hopes up.',3,'2002-08-29','',1544),(8,'Edible Vomit','MadTom','madtom@comic.com','Edible Vomit endures as my favourite ZZT game of all time. It has a depth which one generally does not come to expect from drac0, taking Teen Priest and other such games as an example.\n\nYou are Freddy the Ferret, a rodent heroin junkie on the quest for the perfect drug, wandering through a trippy (and superbly drawn) ZZT world. Along the way you will administer marijuana to a rabbit, steal a toke from a nine-year-old, yell at a \'wounded wanker,\' and bash hell out of a statue of a child, using a hammer.\n\nTypical drac0ism? Not so. As you near the end of the game it becomes very clear that there is some very deep meaning here. Whilst not exactly subtle it is nevertheless very effective; the use of drugs is finally called into question.\n\nWith basic but appropriate and effective music, superb (and in my opinion anachronistic) graphics, and a very emotive storyline interwoven with the drac0isms we all know and hate/love, Edible Vomit is without a doubt one of the greatest ZZT games ever made.\n\nAnd, hell, you\'ve got to love a game starring a rat named Stinky who does too many white lines and likes doing weird stuff to dead guys.',5,'2002-08-29','',1277),(9,'Rocker','MadTom','madtom@comic.com','Here\'s something new. I\'m quite a fan of simulation games, which involve concepts like self- improvement, and such. And this was quite an interesting new twist on the idea.\n\nMoonpie\'s last game is about you, an aspiring guitarist. To improve your skill at playing, you can purchase better guitars, books, videos ... or a slightly less direct source of inspiration ... drugs purchased from a dude at the back of the guitar store.\n\nEarn money by playing at gigs at the local club as the people sit in monastic silence, and go off to again purchase better equipment.\n\nYet, whilst a nice idea, it is not fully developed. It would have been nice to be introduced to a main character, with a few more boards, other characters to interact with, a nice conclusion. Moonpie confesses that the game itself was made in under a week ... but still.',2,'2002-08-29','',1522),(10,'Misc. Garbage: A Game of Nothing','MadTom','madtom@comic.com','Yet another Chickenwire takeoff? The genre is exhausted. A game full of completely random and utterly incomprehensible piffle is more difficult than it seems to pull off successfully.\n\nBoxtop11 does appear to take care with such things as STK and has a few stylistic ideas, but needs to move away from this genre and show what he can make with a plot.

Proof that good puzzles can be done without the use of an inventory engine, Enigma\'s gameplay shines, except for that bit with the knife.\n\nAnd, of course, Enigma pioneered the Mission: Enigma title screen, in which characters use the title screen to bicker and perform little tricks. Just a bit of ZZT trivia, there.\n\nPros: Nice puzzles, good design\nCons: Tepid plotline, the knife puzzle\nRating: 9/10',5,'2002-08-29','',378),(12,'Bomb Squad! 1','GameMstr1','GameMstr1@hotmail.com','It has virtually no STK.

Two RPG battles, a Wak-a-Mole style arcade sequence, a very good rendition of Pong, and a well-done endgame action sequence serve to prevent boredom from setting in. These sequences are all well-executed, but the experience of playing OGVP1 is mainly one of watching cutscenes, following characters around, and bumping into people. This isn\'t necessarily a problem; an interactive movie game can be a good ZZT game, provided that it works as an interactive movie.\n\nIn a ZZT game, having any coherent storyline at all is a considerable merit. In an interactive movie, the plotline is obviously crucial. Even when, as in the case of OGV1, the storyline is overused, predictable, and unlikely, it still lends some enjoyment to a game by providing a general goal for the player and a driving force for the action. The plotiline of OGV1 serves its purpose of keeping the show going, and is moderately entertaining in a \"watch the Death Star explode\" way.\n\nWhat does OGV1 do wrong? Well, not much, as ZZT games go. There are annoying spelling errors, and the storyline requires a very heavy dose of suspension of disbelief due to its internal inconsistency, but this sort of thing is expected. The real problem is not what OGV1 does wrong, but what it could have done right. It could have done something unpredictable with the story. It could have added some interesting twist to the mechanics of the RPG battles. It could have given us truly interesting characters, or some clever humor, or a bit of real drama, horror, or excitement.\n\nIn short, OGV1 could have been a really good game, as opposed to being \"very good as ZZT games go.\" It has its moments, certainly, but it could have been better.\n\nThis review might seem extremely negative, but I\'m only concentrating on the negative aspects of OGV1 because it could have been much better. OGV1 does get a lot of things right, like its well- animated cutscenes, its attempts to make the environment seem extensive (it really looks, at times, as if the stark environments are being used as more than set pieces), and its avoidance of pointless \"filler\" material. It\'s better than 90% of the ZZT games out there, if not more. It\'s cleanly executed, and it\'s very workmanlike.\n\nAgain, though, it could have been much better with a little more polish and a bit of originality.',4,'2002-08-29','',1331),(18,'Operation: GAMMA VELORUM','Fishfood','misanthropyrules@hotmail.com','I\'m a big fan of sci-fi, and If theres any genre that ZZT was just made for, it\'s the interactive movie. Why then, such an average score?\n\nAfter loading up the game, quitting to set the speed a setting higher (This is normally a must with games that don\'t use text boxes at all), I watch a movie. Then another movie. After this, I start walking around, this is a pleasant change, not because I hate movies, but because the plot and dialouge where incredibly cardboard and while I don\'t expect fight club, I wouldn\'t mind something a little better than spy kids.\n\nAs wells said (I think), if you\'re going to make an I-cinema game, then good for you, but you MUST make sure you concentrate on making the plot interesting. No amount of fancy graphics or engines will change an I-cinema game that has a plot this slow or obvious. The game was maybe to short for a plot twist, but that wouldn\'t stop Quantum from thinking up something a little more realistic. Two teenagers get up, go to a mall, enlist in an army and at the end go to bed. I dunno, the whole \'Teenagers save the world\' thing is a bit saturday morning television for my tastes. You could of course say code red ran along similar lines, but let\'s not forget I really don\'t like code red much, either.\n\nOutside of the plot, the game ran pretty smooth with a few exceptions. While the other engines where original, fun and not annoying, the RPG battles where awful. Or should I say the first one was. I seemed to miss everything, and I was very close to zapping through, which I very rarely do on a game I intend to review. This engine to suffers from a lack of realisim. Taking longer to destroy a bully than it does a group of three terrorists - even if you use a revolver on the bully and a knife on the terrorists - seems a bit crazy to me.\n\nThe worst thing about the game? Much like my last reviewed game by Commodore, this game uses USELESS \'Object follows you around\' coding, which does NOTHING but look bad, annoy the hell out of most people, and slow everything down. It wasn\'t majorly buggy, but pushing an object out of my way all the time is not my idea of fun. Worse still, the object had some critical programming, meaning I couldn\'t just zap it and get on with my day. I hope this isn\'t going to be a trend.\n\nAgain, to semi-repeat Wells, this IS NOT a bad game, it\'s certainly playable to people who like I- cinema games, but it\'s nothing like the \'WARTORN-ish\' game that Dr. Dos describes. Quantum needs to focus either on PLOT if OGV wishes to be an I-cinema game in the future, or non-engine gameplay if it does not. Either way, there\'s a lot of promise here, but don\'t expect the world. Not yet, anyway.',3,'2002-08-29','',1331),(19,'A christmas Gone Horribly, Horribly Wrong','Moonpie','','Ok.

I literally wanted to crap my pants just so I could get away from the thought of the random assorted beeps going through my head. Yecch.\n\nNow, the real strength in this game is the gameplay. Oh, whoops, did I say gameplay? I meant *DELETING THE GAME*. Seriously, why would I want to sit around and look at a motionless board filled with seemingly UNFUNNY dialouge? I don\'t even want to continue to review this game, that is HOW BAD it really is. The graphics, music, and characters are horrible.

The game takes place in a town where for many generations its inhabitants have tourmented by a demons and beasts flowing out of a crypt. You, the stranger, have come to save them for some reason.\n\nThe game quickly cuts to the chase with no unnecessary cinimatics or boards. The game is a dungeon game. Some people are turned off by simple exploratory games with very little dynamic. Sure you do the same things: shoot the demon, search the body, grab a arrow, light a torch, and contuinue on. But what makes this game stick is it is able to create a mood. The widespread use of the colour red really makes the game feel cool. Adding to that are the tons of mangled bodies you find and their darkly comic discriptions.\n\nThe ending is a bit thin, and unless the other game i\'m thinking about came after it, it\'s been done before. But it is well drawn,( i like how you can see that guy\'s spine )\n\nMy only complaint is that mid-way through the levels there wasn\'t a part that fowarded to story any, and that in the later level there was no simple way out except the way you came in.

The technology has been used for studying different cultures in Earth\'s past. At the begining of the game you find out that aliens far more advanced that humans, have set up military bases in different places in time and your mission is to destroy them.\n\nWell It\'s hard to do a time traveling game without someone comparing it to Chrono Wars. So I\'ll let some other reviewer do that.\n\nInstead I\'ll touch on the graphics. Well there isn\'t much of that. No, but seriously, Liver (can i use just Liver? I like to use nouns for names...) Liver uses very little range of colour. Its rare when you\'ll see more than three colours on a board, and when there are more colours, they\'re usually there because they\'re the bulit in enemies. The graphics aren\'t bad, just sparse. Liver uses STK on every board and the graphics never hurt your eyes. Their simplicity actually is quite pleasing on the eyes.\n\nThe gameplay seems to play the secondary to the plot. It seems as though Liver had this idea in his/her head for a game and wanted to get it all down as quickly as possible before he/she forgot. The game uses a lot of built in enemies. The most abundant being catapillars which is the first trap the majority of zzters fall into. (They are pretty cool, just boring after the fifth one with 25+ segments.)\n\nSo to sum up.\n\nLiver made the story of primary importance (you can tell by the long scrolls of information pumped at you.) Game play seems rushed and at some times Sweenyesque. Graphics sort of ran hand and hand with game play. The story made the game.

It\'s all up to chance. But whichever way you go first doesn\'t matter.\n\nThe Nadir path presents the third-person past tense narrative of a girl named Mir, struggling through a dungeon marked with many dead and gruesomely mutilated bodies. A picture of inner turmoil is painted here. Yet with the odd reflection of Mir\'s we see a slight hint of Zenith ... a tad of humour.\n\nThe Zenith path is completely different. Your nameless character is flung into an abyss of complete and utter happy-go-lucky chaos and hilarious disarray. You battle such fierce and fearsome beasts as fleas and tamagochis, and my personal favourite, Incontinence Man (prone to losing control of his bladder when kicked in the appropriate area).\n\nAt the end of each path you meet its creator ... either Zenith or Nadir. Both end your game ... but in decidedly different ways.\n\nThe depth of Psyche is something I believe not usually seen in ZZT games. Zenith\'s characteristic tidy style and amusing insights add a curious charm to the whole game, and it seems very complete.

I started by loading the ZZT world. I was presented with a horribly drawn title screen; on which upon I said \'THAT\'S WHAT A SOCCER BALL LOOKS LIKE?\' Or, atleast I thought it was a soccer ball. Might have been some creepy face that you would find on the wall of the haunted mansion in disneyland. No matter, let us continue. I pressed P, and was greeted with \"SNIKA PRODUCTIONS\", which was basically randomly drawn lines put together, and in the middle it said the title of the company. I quickly scuttled to the next board.\n\nThe menu system was easy to use, and easily made. Move the cursor UP/DOWN and then pick a target, which the cursor promply shoots it. My first choice was the \'about\' section, because that\'s what it told me to do. I realized there was some music playing. Horrible music, sounded like it was made with a random ZZM creator. Literally, the high notes were very far apart from the low ones, so there were seemingly random \"BEEP BEEP\"s every now and then. Ok, blahalah, lets talk about the tutorial.\n\nThe tutorial made the game seem really, well, NON-SOCCER-BASED. Also, it didn\'t teach me anything, except how to use ?+K. Lets move on.\n\nThe game was OK, even an attempt at a plotline, which you rarely see in sports-style games. I guess I entered a tournament and I was destined to become a soccer champ, or something. So, I enter the brown passage behind the counter, and I get a board with a soccer field on it, and some red/white guys come pouring out. I freaked out, but that wasn\'t the real game.\n\nThe engine was simplistic. Walk up to the ball and it moves away from you. Type ?+K and you have 5 seconds to kick the ball, where it then keeps moving until it is touched again, and that includes bouncing off walls. There was about 10 opponents on the other team, and like, 3 on mine, including me. Since there was no real AI in this game, it is very easy to get the ball away from your goal. Getting it in the other is the hard part. The opponents always seem to take the ball before you can do anything with it, and it got so frustrating I quit the game.\n\nWhile this is a good attempt at a sports style game, there is much need/room for improvement.

I feel it\'s my duty to acknowledge the few newbies who I believe have the potential to make great games, and highlight their skills and weaknesses before it\'s too late and they give up, and fade away.\n\nCommodore isn\'t someone the community wants to be fading away too soon. Let me get this straight though, The Living Dead is not a great game in itself, but it\'s the prospect of future games and the skills it showcases that make it worthwhile. It was made under the company name of \'Mirror Image Games\', which is basically a partnership between Commodore and a fellow newbie Snika. While it remains to see if Snika can achieve this level of quality on his games, Commodore certainly has jumped the first hurdle.\n\nOn to the game then. In living dead you play a man called John Williams, who goes to answer a cry for help after being attacked by a zombie in his car. The game continues from there, and levels of stupidity get higher as the plot continues. It\'s not BAD stupidity, it\'s b-movie stupidity and in the majority of places, it feels right. The scene in the house is great, and the scene in the shed was actually rather brilliant, the sound effects and graphics really came together for the first (and only) time.\n\nGraphics wise, the game varies in skill from the rather primitive shading of the interiors to the pretty object drawn stain glass windows of a church. There\'s a lot of a path and a lot of trees that seem to look like a scene from SPRG after a while. The sound is also eclectic, ranging from the awful title screen music to the creepy music in the shed, it\'s not a good idea to keep it on all the time.\n\nGameplay wise, there isn\'t really much here, unfortunatly. Long walking scenes serve to extend the playing time, but battles for the most part use ZZT\'s shooting engine and offer nothing new or exciting, and only just keep you away from plot long enough to keep going. Bosses are annoying but bareable, and have the appopriate attacks. The talking scenes are more fun, with the dialouge as cheesy as the plot itself and the game moving at a nice pace. While Commodore lists Romero as an influence, I feel it plays more like \'Evil Dead\' than \'Night of the Living Dead. It didn\'t have such a huge scale as the latter, and the more blunt comedy was also evident.\n\nThe only two things to really complain about was the way you swapped characters without being told, which confused me a little to begin with, and the way the people followed behind you. In a normal RPG, a char will just #die and a flag will be set they are in the party, but in TLD your partner follows you around, making for buggy walking and annoying times when they get stuck. There\'s no real reason for it, and it ruins the flow of the game to shoot your partner and have him re-appear on the next board.\nIt\'s not enough to stop playing, but it is enough to annoy very quickly.\n\nIn summary, Commodore is destined to go far once he Hones his skils a little. I see in him a young Madtom, and like Madtom, his skills are improving very rapidly, but he still has a long way to go from his rather horrible \'Ghostbusters Demo\' to making a renowned game like Burgular. However, I don\'t wish to hype him as the NEXT anybody, and his future in the community is what he makes it. I wish him the best of luck and hope he continues to improve and make more ZZT games.',3,'2002-08-29','',1534),(50,'','King Graham','piez@rocketjump.org','More like \"Mark Lu\'s Big Failure\".\nThis game, sickeningly short and off-topic from the current 24hozzt contest, has brought me to tears with its painfully bad humor and graphics which will make you attempt to claw your eyes out.\n\nWhat did this game recieve in the contest? 73rd place? 143rd place?

Knightt has starbux, Cronos has scorch, and drac0 has \'master raze\'. The first Raze game I played, whose name I cannot remember, is probably exactly what chickenwire would play like if it was mixed with teen priest, and all the elements of humour and gameplay where removed. To be fair, he has improved since then. Just not by much.\n\nOf course, when someone of mediocre skill makes a game based on such a tired and ulitmatly pointless concept of \'live\', you just know it\'s going to be pretty bad. And it is, but in a suprising way! This isn\'t really a sim life game at all. Sure, its title IS sim: life, but a more apt name would run something like \'Master raze\'s adventures in hitting puberty\'. I can\'t make any real presumptions about Raze\'s real life, but it seems the game to be less of a fictional story and more of what raze wishes his life would be like.\n\nWhen I play a sim life game, i expect it to generally resemble life in some way or another. I\'m not saying it has to be exactly the same as mine, but it should be at least realistic. You know, wake up, breakfast, work (REAL work), maybe go out or stay at home and watch TV. The character should be a real person, not some \'player\' who sounds like they\'ve just been dreampt up by the writers of american pie. I want to be rejected by women. I want to lose my car keys and only realise 2 minutes before I have to leave for work. I want to take my dog to the vet. Yes, that would make a for a boring game, but life sims are MEANT to be boring and crappy, becuase LIFE is boring and crappy.\n\nAdding pornography and drugs doesn\'t really do much for the game other than to further prove that raze doesn\'t know much about either women or narcotics. Wells has already mentioned the most tedious parts of the banal gameplay, so I won\'t go into that. It does have its good points. It\'s good some pretty good graphics, and it\'s Razes best game so far.

A welcome departure from Raze\'s usual themes of sex and death, S:L carefully explores the grimy worlds of sex and drugs.\n\nThe goal of the game is simple - you must accrue 300 \"creativity points\" and 300 \"experience points\" to marry the girl of your dreams. To gain these points, you must take up odd jobs, such as impersonating a priest and giving a supposedly funny (and very derivative) confessional, and engage in intercourse, social and otherwise, with a variety of women.\n\nThere\'s a catch, though. Every few seconds, you lose a bit of health due to hunger. So you also need money to pay for food; standing still for five minutes is a recipe for disaster. That\'s right. Sim: Life is every bit as hectic, stressful, and repetitive as real life. Talk about realism!\n\nWhat money you don\'t spend on food you can use to buy drugs, which grant creativity points (crack: it does a body good), purchase pornographic magazines, which apparently disintegrate after a single reading, or trade in firearms. The net result of this slew of transactions is that the game boils down to a complex math problem.\n\n\"Let\'s see... I have 30 creativity points, so I can do some stand-up comedy and get 45 dollars, which I can use to buy a pistol to sell for a 5 dollar, 2 exp, and 2 creativity point profit. Then I can go and buy a pornographic magazine, return home, and get more experience, but oh, man. I can\'t buy food then. Maybe if I go to the prostitute who trades 25 money for a bit of EXP first... \"\n\nThe above sort of thought sequence repeats over, and over, and over, as it takes a long, repetitive time to get 300 EXP and creativity points. You can speed the process by taking a few \"errand boy\" jobs, but it doesn\'t help much. Perhaps I\'m missing some way of getting 200 creativity points in one go, but I don\'t see it.\n\nWhat, then, is good about Sim: Life? Well, it does have a few funny moments - although one would hope for more, given that Raze doesn\'t pull any punches here, and it does have an interesting concept, a few nice sequences, and a decent premise.

The game is comical enough that when you keep losing you don\'t get frustrated. Check the walkthroughs if you need help. The music is real, real good, and real perfection as far as ZZT goes.

Consequently, its release resulted in claims by almost everyone that it was Matt\'s bast game, and one of **the** best ZZT games ever made.\n\nBut, of course, almost everyone is STUPID and WRONG, as you will see.\n\nThe basic set-up of the game (you\'re in prison for stealing food) is thrown out the window almost immediately, and replaced by two alternate storylines, neither of which is really as funny or interesting as the programmer seems to think.\n\nThe first is a spoof of Titanic, except even less funny than what you\'re imagining right now. For example, the ship is called \"Dietanic\". Get it? Because lots of people died on the Titanic, and it rhymes with \"Titanic\" and *everything*! Guffaw! And the girl\'s name is Nose! Because that sounds like Rose!\n\nI\'m not making this up, you know.\n\nThe second plot is a parody of various things, including the Wizard of Oz, and ends with the player talking to the creator of the game himself. What comedy! Sorry, that should read \"What? *Comedy?*\n\nOkay so it\'s been pretty negative so far. Anything good? Well, the graphics are quite nice. Yup.\n\nRight, that\'s out of the way, back to tearing this to shreds:\n\n*The dialogue is lame, and characters have no personality outside of their accents.\n*The gameplay is pretty much nonexistant. Aside from the odd action scene it\'s just a case of wandering about talking to everyone and hoping the \"plot\" progresses soon.\n*The jokes, as I\'ve mentioned, are awful.\n\nStill, the game is only 33% what MadGuy originally envisioned, so I guess we lucked out on that other 67%.',1,'2002-08-30','',804),(71,'Duke Nukem ZZT','WildWeasel','wildweasel_lemon@hotmail.com','Most people would get turned off because \"this is a lame ZZT ripoff of an existing game\".

The graphics are all STK, with some pretty nice effects. The gameplay is just like ZZT\'s in that you shoot enemies and grab ammo, but what can ya do about it, it\'s ZZT.

Sadly this isn\'t the case, and the wafer-thin plot is made even more lame by its numerous holes. Why is our \"hero\" special? How do the elders keep control?

For here on this CD is a collection of music so divine that it brings tears to my eyes and a lump to my trousers. David\'s singing skills are so expansive and so experimental that he eschews mere \"notes\" and \"keys\" and instead rockets into whole new realms of sound. One minute he sings with the manly grumble of an ox crushed by a pneumatic piston - the next he has the graceful strength of someone sledgehammering blowfish. Soaring vocals go higher than any mountain climber could, even if he had wings and was in a space shuttle. Then just as quickly they swoop down like a suicidal Japanese businessman, hitting the sidewalk with a biological thump. Beats swirl around like kittens in a washing machine as a series of dancing mosquitos tinkle like triangles stapled to a dormouse.

Maybe it\'s just me, but Wayward\'s games always seem vastly overrated. His plots are melodramatic where plain drama would be preferable, and though they\'re usually based around a solid central concept they always feel like missed opportunities.\n\nTake Within, for example, which almost everyone creamed themselves over - the basic idea (dreams and reality bleeding into each other) was great, but the characterisation was lame and the actual plot just ambled around until the sudden and preposterous ending. I\'d hoped with Apud that Wayward would have developed a little, but sadly no.\n\nBasically, you play Wayward ( a little self-obsessive don\'t you think?). Having committed suicide, you float between heaven and hell, and your actions in the game - good or evil - determine which ending you get. Basically this amounts to walking left and right around a looping playfield, using objects in basic fetch-and-retrieve quests until you just can\'t be bothered, or find anything else to do. Then you just \"ascend\" and watch your fate be decided. You can actually ascend at any time in the game, though obviously you stand a better chance of going to Heaven if you play properly.\n\nThe graphics are pretty damned nice, and certainly an improvement on Within. There are also quite a few nice touches - the subliminal message gag and the aging house occupants being just two - but none of these distract from the pedestrian gameplay or uninvolving plot.\n\nWhich brings me back to one of my initial points - the idea of someone drifting between two worlds could have been genuinely interesting, but here it\'s just a bunch of cameos and silly puzzles. For example, Wayward could have used a fictional character and had his struggle in limbo reveal details about his friendships and past, and what drove him to suicide. But no, it\'s CAMEOS AHOY!\n\nWell okay, I guess that\'s what Wayward wanted, but it is somewhat annoying to hear people going on about what a genius game it is when all I can see is one big missed chance.',1,'2002-09-06','195.93.33.11',1426),(91,'Butt','My Liver Hurtz','myliverhurtz@yahoo.ca','This was one of the first ZZT games I downloaded, and to tell you the truth I did like it to an extent.\n\nI\'m not going to spoil the plot for you, it\'s far too interesting to do that.\n\nGraphics: Blokeware uses almost every colour available, and to tell you the truth it hurt my eyes on some boards because of the contrast.

Some RPGers were very disapointed, and consider FFZZT a failure in the world of RPGs, yet I STRONGLY disagree... I will share my opinions in this review.\n\nGraphics - This is definately the point I judge RPGs the least on, but nonetheless, Final Fantasy ZZT definately delivers in this catagory. The pre-rendered backgrounds are absolutely outstanding, easily the best in any video game I\'ve seen to date (and this is a year after it\'s been out!) The polygons are EXACTLY what I like in RPG characters... they are based off of Skullie\'s amazing art, and capture SD anime art VERY well, much better than what I\'ve seen of Chase\'s in the Final Fantasy ZZT X demo. They move VERY well, with great body language throughout. You really feel like you control the character. I remember thinking in past RPGs such as Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy 6 (3 in the US) things like \"Well why can\'t Chrono jump on top of this thing?\" or \"Gosh! Why won\'t the game let Locke climb across this rock?\" or whatever. In FFZZT, I didn\'t feel that way at all, and felt in complete control of my character. The FMV is absolutely amazing, and, once again, is STILL the best I\'ve seen. It blends flawlessly with the actual gameplay, to create an absolutely amazing storytelling environment. These graphics do not hurt the score at ALL, unlike some gamers, as these are still the best graphics I\'ve seen in not just an RPG, but any GAME to date. (and yes, I\'ve played alot of games since then)\n\nMusic - While not as important as say, gameplay or story, this is an extremely important aspect of any RPG. Guess what? FFZZT delivers. I feel that this soundtrack is Fish\'s finest work, even outdoing any previous Final Fantasy games (FF4-5-6) and Chrono Trigger, which he helped to work on. Songs such as One Winged Faggot, the Final Ryosuck, Valley of the Sexed-Up Karrde, Trishfood, When Ya Hot Ya Hot, Hey Mr. Wonderful, Kaiser Roll, the ending... I could go on forever! Most all of the songs I listed beat anything on FF6 or CT\'s soundtrack, which are the two finest video game soundtracks before FFZZT, in my mind. Enough about music, lets move on to...\n\nCharacters - Karrde did a GREAT job creating the amazing characters of FFZZT. I feel that these are some of the best in any RPG to date, if not the best. It seems as though he took the best of Amano\'s and Toriyama\'s styles and talents, and combined them for the characters in FFZZT, and it definately works! Rick Retro and Nick Nostalgia are two of the deepest video game characters ever made, and all of the other playable characters develope strongly in FFZZT, while in games such as Chrono Trigger, FF6, FF5, or FF4, not all of the characters develope, only the main one(s). In FFZZT, even characters such as Cait Sith and Togepy have very memorable and touching moments, while I can\'t recall any such as that about Mog, Umaro, Gogo, or Antonio Banderas. :o| Also, FFZZT features LOADS of side characters. YOu might have to take notes to keep track of them all! I\'ll bet there are almost 100 characters given names in this game, that each have an important role in the story, and you must keep track of them all to get the full effect. Outstanding job, Karrde!\n\nGameplay - one of the most important aspects of an RPG is the gameplay, as you will get in MANY battles throughout the game. If those aren\'t fun, it spoils the gaming experience. Once again, FFZZT delivers. It takes the best qualities of all of the previous Fish games: the defined characters of FF4, the amazing customization of FF5, the exciting battles of FF6, the strategy and fun of Chrono Trigger, and puts combines them all into this one game. I feel it takes the best aspects, and it does create quite a package. The battles are fun and interesting, and don\'t get as old as some RPGs. ::COUGHCOUGHCHASEBRAMBLEBUSHCOUGHCOUGH:: The Oralsexia system offers great customization, but puts severe limits on what characters can use, unlike FF6. Also, while there are some overpowerful Oralsexia (Knights of the Mouth and 4x Cock, mainly) they either take FOREVER to get or require LOADS of AP to level up to be useful. The Anus Break system is one of the best I\'ve ever seen. I mean, if you are in a fight, and you are being beaten, you are probably gonna get upset enough eventually to really take it to the guy. That\'s how anus breaks work! As you get hit, a little meter fills up. When it reaches the top, you get to unleash a super-powerful attack on the ememies, causing LOADS of damage to the boss\' anus, and usually finishing off a random sexing right then. Overall, when you combine the great customization, character definition in battle, enjoyment, strategy, etc. in FFZZT\'s battles, it creates a package unmatched in RPG gameplay.\n\nStory - WOW! This is easily the best story in any RPG I\'ve ever played... no contest! It is VERY complex, can be taken on many many different levels, is always exciting and fast paced, never gets boring, and requires several play throughs to really understand! It is VERY deep, and has lots of very complex symbolism, that you won\'t get without spending a few hours at the library. The loads of characters, great side plots and extra things to do, addictive gameplay, outstanding secrets, and AMAZING setting (graphics, music, dialogue) all add up to the best story I\'ve ever seen in an RPG, and one of the best I\'ve ever heard, PERIOD! Far superior to all of its predecessors and RPGs of the company (or ANY company. Including Xenogears, FFTactics, FF4-5-6, Chrono Trigger, Dragon Quest 6, Star Ocean, etc), FFZZT\'s story is a VERY memorable one, and I can\'t imagine a better one. With themes of love, hope, courage, destiny, and all around life, it has something for everyone!\n\nOverall - FFZZT seems to be the product of every Fish RPG before it: it takes the best elements of each, a $30 million budget, a staff in the hundreds, and 3 years of time, and we get FFZZT, the best video game ever made.

But as with almost every Chase Bramlage game, the gorgeous visuals can\'t make up for the dreadful, *dreadful* gameplay.\n\nIn the case of  NEO, you\'re tossed from subgame to subgame with only the tiniest fraction of a second before your character is horribly killed by snipers/mines/guards/whatever. There are no helpful explanations of what to expect on each screen, just a brief few seconds before you\'re tapping the ESC key and glowering at your monitor. Chase\'s games seem to be less a test of the player\'s skills and more some kind of twisted Pavlovian experiment, with the player acting out the part of the salivating dog. Except instead of spit, all you\'ll have in your mouth at the end of playing is bile.\n\nAssuming you can get through the teeth-gratingly difficult five screens allotted to each character, you\'ll get a passcode for the next disc which - apparently - was never released.\n\nThe plot is thrown at the player in a 500-word infodump (the lamest of all literary devices) at the start, although it pretty much boils down to \"DNDNDNNDNDN SUPER SOLDIERS\". There\'s virtually no actual plot progression because of the missing second disk and frankly, the only real entertainment comes from Bramlage\'s laughable spelling (\"Washingtom, Philadelpia\").\n\nOne point for being pretty. None for anything else.',1,'2002-09-06','195.93.33.11\r',797),(95,'Apparitions of the SHITTY more like! Ho! Ho! Ho!','Funk','wilko_3000@yahoo.com','When I first reviewed this poetry and art collection, I summed it up as \"shitty art + crappy poetry = crappy shit\". However, I was informed by Kev that this did not constitute \"constructive criticism\". I shall, then, go through each of the poems one by one, commenting on the poem and the art that goes with it.\n\n**haiku 1**: Actually I kind of like this one, although haikus are so rigid they\'re hard to fuck up. Does fairly well at evoking an image. But what are the headlights reflecting off? Seriously, I\'m not taking the piss - you have to clarify the not immediately obvious. And in a haiku that\'s not possible, so better to use a less obtuse noun.\n\n**poem 1**: There are a number of generic amateur poem genres. This one is the \"taking an ordinary object and making it a thing of beauty\" one. In this case, a fluorescent lamp. Sadly, rather than create any original or interesting images, he just hammers down lots of words like \"undulating\", \"purity\" and \"celestial\" and hopes they sound good. He even uses the word \"decadent\", for fucks\' sake. This is so much like a parody of generic teen poetry it\'s not true. The art\'s just a bunch of white solids, fakes and breakables. Why?\n\n**haiku 2**: Again, it\'s hard to fuck up a haiku and again this is quite good. In fact, I\'ll repeat it in its entirity:\n\n*purest wind carries\nour empty shells across the\ngrave mountains downtown*\n\nSee? The restrictive nature of haiku means that Kev can\'t give in to his teenpoet sensibilities and slap down as many polysyllabic words as he can - he has to choose his words carefully, and this works well. I would, however, have used \"bitter\" rather than \"purest\", if only because it looks less anachronistic given the images and tone of the other lines. I know some might think that it\'s changing the point of the haiku, but I honestly don\'t think Kev chose \"purest\" for any reason other than he thinks it looks kind of impressive in a poem.\n\n**poem 2**: Just when it was going well, it\'s back to the teenpoetry. Again we\'re working with a teenpoetry cliche - this time it\'s the DNDNDNDN GIRL IS PRETTY IN MY DREAMS one. Some of the imagery is more effective here (the image of her floating in a \"black wedding dress, eyes blazing\" is strong in its simplicity although it is somewhat derivative), but his insistence on using mathematical symbols, parenthesis and misspelling \"thru\" makes it look like a Radiohead inlay. Predictable use of reverse-metaphor (\"the midnight sky shines brighter than the sun\"), and tired subject matter (outside world is grey with rain, brightened only by Her beauty). Poor art. Disappointing.\n\n**haiku 3**: Whaddaya know? A crap haiku. Cuts off abruptly, imagery fails to evoke anything in me. Quite the opposite of haiku 2. Beginning to talk like Rorschach.\n\n**poem 3**: A big one. Dull subject matter (looking at the lives of people in NYC) not lightened by verbosity. Again, we get words such as \"angelic\" used more because they look good than because they mean anything. I mean, New York an \"angelically restless and spellbound city\"? Restless yes, spellbound you could probably sell me on if the subject of the poem was about uncovering that spell (money? the media?), but ANGELIC? NYC? In fact, calling any city \"angelic\" is absurd since none of the connotations that the word carries could possibly apply to any city, let alone the most famously badass town of them all. You can\'t just throw these words about without qualification.\n\nParenthesis and maths symbols continue even (though they) are retarded+annoying. Poor puns that are too wordy to work (the line about transcending and descending).\n\n**haiku 4**: Boring. Another DNDNDN THIS IS WHAT I IMAGINE IT WOULD BE LIKE TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND poem. Don\'t tell us that her eyes are \"freezing a moment\"; that\'s what the haiku is supposed to BE - a frozen moment of time. Also, don\'t say \"your eyes, intense\" - come up with a way of describing the intensity of those eyes. I\'m sure you don\'t want to read a poem about \"your shirt, green\". Haiku 2 worked because you said the wind carried your \"shells\", not your \"bodies\". See? \"Shell\" implies both the body and its hollowness, emphasises its fragility and that paradox that it\'s designed to protect. Choose your words more carefully. The best haikus evoke a feeling, not describe it.\n\n**poem 4:** So yeah, there\'s life in everything, including frickin\' parentheses again. Obvious ironic contrast between life and dead things. Dull central concept made duller by the tiresome and formulaic layout of the poem. Rather than offhandedly mention a \"skeleton-tree\" (a cliche in itself), why not explore that tree and descibe how it lives still or - if that\'s your point - how the life has left it forver. Also, rather thn use the usual \"life sucks, ohh cold weather, death angst\" crap (you might as well staple a sign to your head saying \"I\'m a third-rate teenpoet. Ask me how!\") why not approach it from another angle? Talk about how life will spring from the tree in, er, Spring. Or how those graveyards left untended can become forests (life growing from the remains of death... come on this is - pun not intended - fertile ground). Death for death\'s sake is just boring.\n\nConclusion, to Kev and everyone else: THINK about what you\'re putting down on the paper or on the screen. Look at each word. Does it get across what you\'re trying to say? Are you just writing what\'s there, or are you writing what you want the reader to feel?\n\nBranch out your subjects. Life isn\'t always grey and miserable, even if you\'re a teenager. Even Sylvia Plath wrote some wonderfully life-affirming pieces (indeed, they make up about 33% of the Ariel collection).\n\nAlso, Mark Rothko uses pretty colours.

If that was the intended goal, then I say \"BRAVO, WEIRDMAN, YOU JUST MADE YOUR POINT.\"\n\nFrom the very onset, Weirdman was intent on showing that Megazeux was superior to ZZT, from its community on down to the mechanics of the Megazeux editor. Like Terryn, above me, pointed out, he used lots of dated references and jokes no one in their correct mindframe would get. He even went so far as to call booth(the guy who made Bizanloo, Codename Pickle, and Attack of the Smilies) a \"newbie\". It was like the guy just stood up and said \"Let\'s just find some ZZTer and call him a newbie\", because Weirdman obviously didn\'t know what in the fuck he was talking about when he did that.\n\nPlus, in my view, completing this game requires me to sit back and wonder something.

No internal turmoil shit about the moral implecations of stealing or killing, just fun robbery with a great revenge twist added in.\n\nThis game INSPIRED me back into the ZZT world.

It proves that you can imitate or even create epic scope with ZZT.  Chase has pretty much some of the best graphics I\'ve seen. The cutscenes are drawn wonderfully.\n\nThe game play leaves a little to be desired, but in general the programming is good. The constant craving for blood adds to the rate at which you play the game. The drain of health, for the blood hunger, is slow enough to be toleralbe, but qucik enough to add excitement. The way you go about getting blood is probably what sets the mood so well. You go into these towns where people just stand around, and when people see you they run. They don\'t fight or call for help. Then you swoop down and tear them to shreads, sucking every last drop from their marrow.\n\nCertainly the game has a very thick atmosphere. The dark cathedrals, the moist caves. The types of trees actually change based on climate.\n\nThe story, being turned into a vampire, seems not too original, but the inner turmoil (Yes I proclaimed not to like it in Burgler!, this is a different sort of game.) Makes the player feel awkward for the first few minuites about playing such a wierd character. But the way the races of the world are painted, you begin to enjoy, and near the end actually relish the idea that you\'re going to another town to devour people.\n\nThe midi music included makes the game very dark and shadowy.

In this type of joke, the audience is meant laugh as a situation grows more and more bizarre. An example would be the famous stateroom scene in the Marx Brothers\' \"A Night at the Opera.\" At first, a few people occupy a small stateroom. Then cleaning staff come in. Then somebody comes to deliver a meal, and is caught inside with everybody else. Then somebody comes to fix a piece of furniture. And so on. The room, of course, becomes about as tightly packed as a sardine can, leading to an inevitable punchline.\n\nNothing Constructive Part One is a hard game to review, because it\'s missing the punchline. It\'s cleverly written, with comic tension building as the PC manages to anger one interplanetary power after another, but there\'s no ending - just a cliffhanger. The story is neatly done, and the action between the cutscenes is well-planned and carefully executed, but the punchline never comes.\n\nThis is to be expected, of course, as it was being saved for the sequel, but there is no sequel. NC Part Two was never released, and probably never will be, as Zanno left the community. What\'s left is a witty, fun game without an ending.\n\nWhether or not you can still enjoy the game depends, I guess, on whether you could read, say, the first two books of the Lord of the Rings and be contented to leave it at that.\n\nI, for one, will take what I can get. As long as it lasts, NC provides great fun.\n\nPros: Good graphics, good programming, good storytelling, good gameplay.\n\nCons: The cutscenes are told as infuriatingly sluggish little captions at the bottom of the screen, instead of quick-to-read text boxes.

It is not funny. The plot is not clever. Jesus, how low your standards must be to think that this is anyhting CLOSE to being a classic.\n\nOkay, let\'s take this from the top. Nothing Constructive could potentially have been a great game. However, Zanno has fudged up everything horribly. We being with a classic framing device - our heroes are being held at gunpoint, and the lead character (Zanno. I hate it when people put themselves in their games) flashes back to the start of the chain of events that lead to his current situation. This can be particularly effective, as it provides dual narrative tension - how did he get into this position, and will he be able to get out again?\n\nBut Zanno over-eggs the mixture by having the voice-over constantly harp on about how X was the start of the last week of his life, or Y was the reason he was going to get killed blah blah blah. The framing device should be a tease; something to whet our appetites and fire out imaginations, not bore us to death with monologues of doom.\n\nBut this is made worse by having the narrator tell us not only what happens in the long-term, but in the short-term too. We\'re told that Zanno is going to be sentenced to death three screens before it occurs, leaving the player staring at a cinema which tells him nothing he doesn\'t already know. Even the other characters do it - Steve apparently has a limited perception of the future, and repeatedly tells the player that there are baddies in the next room. No surprises. No tension. No reason to keep playing, except the blody-minded drive to complete the game. Someone needs to tie up Zanno and make him watch \"Fight Club\" until he *understands*.\n\nThe voiceovers, as I mentioned before, take up a large part of this game. In a movie this can add to the atmoshpere, with the narrator providing an ironic accompaniment to the action, and allowing the viewer to see exactly what his opinions on the current situation are. However, in Nothing Constructive it\'s used ALL THE FREAKING TIME. This wouldn\'t be so bad but it\'s usually just to hammer in another \"I\'m going to die soon\" anvil.\n\nNow this crappy construction might not be so bad if the plot clever and original, but there\'s nothing new about a guy who has a package that everyone wants. Of course, all we\'ve got here is the first part, but there\'s nothing here to warrant any praise. You get parcel. You get into loosely-connected episodic troubles, people chase you. There are hints that things may not be what they seem but frankly everyone\'s so boring it\'s hard to care.\n\nWhich brings me onto another problem: characterisation. Zanno begins the game by murdering a guy he doesn\'t particularly like. Playing a sociopath might be fun, but midway through the game he\'s taking down robbers and getting pissy when they kill a bunch of hostages. Huh? Jesus, either the guy\'s a nut or he\'s not. Make up your mind.\n\nAside from that, Zanno\'s character is paper-thin. He\'s not particularly funny, and seems to veer between being very dumb and very clever. But he\'s a fully rounded character compared to Steve, whose \"character\" is to stand around being smug. There\'s an attempt (or at least what I assume is an attempt) at rounding him out by having him bicker with a Communist man who joins your party, but their dialogue isn\'t sparky or funny enough to seem like anything more than a waste of your time. The rest of the characters are perfunctory and serve to rattle along the creaking plot.\n\nSpeaking of the Communist, what IS Zanno\'s problem here? We\'re constantly told that Communism is BAD BAD BAD, and from the start Mr. Doom the Communist is shown as an EVIL NASTY GUY who wants to shoot you in the face. Now I\'m assuming that this is building up to an incredible revelation where it turns out that the Communists are the true goodies and help you out. If not, then Zanno\'s got some kind of redneck-style Communist hatred issues to work out.\n\nOkay, I\'m getting tired now so I\'ll list the rest of the stuff - the game uses dialogue at the bottom of the screen rather than in a text box, which is tooth-gnashingly slow. The bad guys are mostly boring to fight against. It features the world\'s worst RPG battle (and no, making a joke about how RPG battles suck does NOT excuse it).

As far as solid puzzle games go, this is definitely one of the top. The puzzles are difficult enough ensure that you don\'t beat it too easily, yet not so hard that you quickly become frustrated and stop playing.\n\nGameplay: The puzzles are generally very solid. As in most games with intricate moving parts such as this, there is sometimes and occasional glitch that prevents you from continuing on as normal, but in most cases you must work hard to create such a glitch on purpose.\n\nGraphics: It\'s hard to apply a graphics rating in a puzzle game. A wide variety of colors are used on each board, causing your mind to \"wake up\" and become attentive for the puzzles. There isn\'t any necessarily attractive graphics, though that isn\'t a necessity for a puzzle game like this.\n\nPlot: The plot is minimal, as would be expected in an average puzzle game.

Run-On involves the player being chased by a dark force which, when it caught the player, was supposed to kill the player. The truly ingenious thing about Run-On was that it was randomly generated and it moved. The player had to be constantly on the move to avoid the darkness. I believe that the game was actually incomplete in terms of having a total, complete ending, but I don\'t believe it had so much to do with WiL\'s competence as with the limits of ZZT.

And it doesn\'t take long to complete.\n\nFeatures/Elements-The relic is the feature advertised in this game, as it is used in going places like many of the crap in the Zelda series(I had a similar idea from that).  But, unlike some game as,\"you gotta get this to go there\", or anything that you got to get those idems respectively.  In this game, he has broke the bonds of liniar adventure and gives you the freedom to play your character...Oooh, but no story and no interacting people other than Chon and a bunch of merchants though.  Hmph, tuff.  Whatcha have is a choice of picking a Rope to go across gaps and lava pits, a Power Glove(see there) to move rocks, or a thief tool, or \"A Pick\" to unlock doors and junk.  Each choice will alter your path in your journey.  Juicy!!\nThere are lots of well programmed OEs, such as the ones in the fire dungeon, and ice dungeon.  The favorite is the ??? that uses its power to make the candles shoot(never though of that).  The thing is that there are so many different ones that keeps your bloodlust going.  Incountering a new enemy and see what it takes to take\'em out is always my thang roh huhl.  More I can say about other games,\"Wow...another damn bear.\"  There\'s also candy coated items you can collect.  Sweet!!\n\nSpeed-Physically on my (brace yourself) PS/1 (ouch!), the game ran at half the normal speed.  I\'ve found the problem.  Five BoardObjects on each board have no pauses.  It toke me 15min to go to every board and add /i under :loop.  That no problem with me and the game ran the way it should.  Now to the game itself.  You choose the relic you start and from there, you can immediately start playing.  I like that.`v\'.  But you do have to run back and forward to buy shtuff and upgrade your weapons.  How fast you progress through the game depends on the person.  If you want to go on a hunt for blood, items, and cash, it might take you longer.  The dungeons are well lenght also and it won\'t take long to take out each dungeons masters.  The combat system is also speedy.  \"Chop, chop, kapow!! You gain 10XP\".  Smoother than the bluntly stoping of many combating windows.  And of course, lack of story sequences that we are not going to get into in this section.\n\n_Atmosphere_\n\nVisual-You can tell graphic is not one of his feats as he uses the \"overly used\" fades.  One more time  \"_OVERLY USED_\" fades, as in it\'s just about everywhere.  I know that there are many other ways to make value that they need to be balanced.  The many color he uses on the dungeons keeps them from being boring and bland.  That\'s one thing I like about him.  The level design is always good.\n\nSound/Music-The music kicks, but I can\'t help having a deja vu of the style of the music.  I like it.\n\nImagetry-Auhh...There\'s no supporting text that gives the scription of the rooms you incounter.  These are the things that draws the player into the game by highthening the sences.  With little to no graphic, these powerful discription will saturate player with there own imagination like in books and literary work.  A DM like me knows this.  But remember the size of his file though...KABOOM!!!\n\n_Story_\n\nThe name says it all.  You are hire to defeat the three dungeon master and take out the Ring Leader.  It might not answers why but thats as far as I can get from there.  Anyway, it hard to come up with a desent story and worry about the game.  Ain\'t like it would die without one.\n\n_Replay_\n\nSince you kick\'d it\'s butt from left to right, let\'s do it vice versa.  The relics made it possible to break it from liniarity.  And cause of the speed, and changing gameplay, it came close of having no end.\n\nI\'ll say this again, I always had liked his games, and uhm...anymore of you players uses me as a waterhose or flippers can go jump.

What is the reason for this you may ask?  Let me take you on a wonderful boat ride.\n\nFirstly, the game is simple.  You are given a simple task of collecting bananas.  No complicated plot to follow, no twists, no lofty goals, just banana retrieving.  The idea of item collection works for almost all platformers and it works just as fine here.\n\nSecondly, the programming in this game is amazing.  He really pulled some awesome stunts here with the different engines and stuff.  WiL knows what he\'s doing with zzt-oop and does it creativly.  However, it uses a different zzt-oop so it might not be the best game to dissect apart and learn from.  The altered exe is also a different touch and gives the game a little more of a \"stand alone\" feel.\n\nThirdly, and this is just iceing on the cake, is the graphics.  Amazing, really really well done here.  Along with the sound and everything else, it creates a game that FEELS like banana quest.  Very good work here.  However,some of the engineshad a few sour graphics, but that could hardly be avoided.\n\nThe game isn\'t perfect however.  Some engines, like the swimming one for example, are a bit flawed and create a very difficult game.  There are parts of the game where you\'ll get fustrated.  All I can suggest is that you need to save a lot.  It also does get a bit slow inparts, and will have you lostin others, but you can hardly blame him.\n\nGood work.

The author probably messed up a couple of story concepts, but that\'s not what detracts from the game.\n\nThe general flow of the story is well-conceived.  The first file has an intro level, then challenges the player to find ten golden keys to finish the game and continue to the second file.  (Though for some reason I ended up with an extra key...?)  The coolest part of the deal is that the player gets to choose where to go next.  Some levels can be beaten at any time (sidequests), while others go in a certain order (main quest).  The scoring system is neat, and the help board explains it pretty well.  The second file is a couple of really hard puzzles and a couple of really hard boss battles that finish off the story.  Overall, the game did a good job of mixing various gaming genres into a coherent story.\n\nThe downside is that the game is really easy to glitch up sometimes, especially on Rytop and Zeta-B7.  The author ought to do some more heavy testing to foolproof the puzzles so they make a bit more sense.  (And if you\'re trying to block off the player from the passage he/she just entered, DON\'T SURROUND IT WITH FAKES AND TRY TO CHANGE THEM TO NORMALS LATER!  If anything, surround the passage with one-way teleporters, then delete them when it\'s time to leave.)  The other bad thing about the game is that most of its boards look rather ugly.

Terminal Introsis. The most common symptom is the placement of a huge knot of exposition in the introduction of a game. When this happens, it is extremely likely that the writing in the remainder of the game will be minimal. The general effect of this is that it becomes clear that the author wanted to get the plotline out of the way early.\n\nRogue Three not only dodges this problem, but completely reverses it. Rather than give the player central information at the beginning of the game, Bitman does something unprecedented.\n\nHe creates suspense, and gives out the answers at the END of the game! At last, a ZZT writer has figured out why mystery and suspense novels sell so well.\n\nThe discovery of the nature of the gameworld is left up to the player. Clues are dropped left and right, but complete explanation is saved for the game\'s ending, which ties up the plot threads and neatly explains the setting of the game for those who missed the clues.\n\nThe ending itself is a mixed bag. To those who don\'t see it coming, it should seem an extremely clever plot twist. To those who DO see it coming, it will probably seem anticlimactic. It\'s still neatly done, though.\n\nGraphics:\n\nA mixed bag. But I don\'t really care.\n\nGameplay:\n\nAlthough Bitman flirts with nonlinearity and multiple scenarios, and has some very clever timer effects, there are several areas of weakness in the gameplay.\n\nThe most noteworthy puzzle of the game is a clever slider puzzle that requires considerable forethought. It is surprisingly good, and brings a bit of life to the tired formula, but it\'s still a slider puzzle. Some might object, I suppose.\n\nThe other sticking point in the gameplay is an \"underground cavern\" sequence of darkened rooms, monsters, and, if you are unlucky enough to be thrown onto one particular plot thread, insufficient ammo. The sequence isn\'t long, but it\'s completely unnecessary.\n\nThe third, and greatest, weakness of the gameplay is the large ratio of walking to actual playing. There are some very nice landscapes, but they are often essentially empty of noteworthy objects.\n\nOn the bright side, the cutscenes and dialogues are in text box form, and can thus be read quickly, without the ridiculous \"one line every ten seconds\" format that results when an author decides to use the bottom-of-the-screen marquee text approach.\n\nOverall:\n\nA very nice game, with a creative plotline.

Doesn\'t that miss the point?\n\nThis becomes even more of a problem due to the nature of ACX-M\'s gameplay. Much of gameo consists of walking around and talking to the cameo objects.

Why throw away the chance to make people actually interested in finding out whether or not their persona is the villain?

It\'s brilliantly hilarious, but that\'s because it pulls all of its dialogue from the brilliantly hilarious novel upon which it is based. On the other hand, it isn\'t exactly an act of plagiarism, as Nanobot credits Douglas Adams with the dialogue...\n\nGameplay:\n\nI suppose the most fitting genre for this demo would be \"semi-interactive tribute.\" It\'s mostly composed of cutscenes, with the exception of one well-executed interactive sequence that nicely captures the atmosphere of the novel\'s opening.\n\nGraphics:\n\nVaried. The cutscene graphics are nice, and I really liked the title screen, but the scene in Arthur Dent\'s house was a bit bland.\n\nWriting:\nBrilliant, as I mentioned. Also in violation of copyright laws, but what can you do? Nanobot trimmed and edited some of the funnier passages from the book and used them for the game\'s dialogue, and the effect is generally a positive one. However, some of his transitions are careless, and his mixing of quotations sometimes results in abrupt shifts in tense.\n\nOh, and it won\'t be QUITE as funny if you\'ve read all the jokes before.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nThis could be a good game if the cutscenes were minimized and replaced with more gameplay. Actually stomping around the house as Arthur Dent [1] has its charms, and exploring the Heart of Gold in the full version could be extremely fun. However, the editing of Adams\' work needs to be more careful, and the quoting less extensive.\n\n[1] The comic timing of this segment is thrown off somewhat by the interactive nature of the sequence, but it\'s still not bad.

Evan Darrow wanted to charge for many of his games, but the games were very amatuerish, usually resulting in no plot, and gigantic meshes of battles with premade monsters and slightly-programmed objects. I really don\'t suggest that any of Darrow\'s games are worth looking at, even though they were done at such an early age. An example of a game of much better quality but was done at the same time is Link\'s Adventure Trilogy, and although that game will not be ranked highly now (post-STK era), the game was definitely a classic of the time.

However...\n\nGet the bad things out of the way. The plot has nothing too special here. \"Evil Wizard killed your master and you must avenge him\" or something, though I must say that the ending is very interesting. In the music department, I don\'t think there was anything spectacular. Some tunes were fine though.\n\nThe graphics were really good for its age, I think. The RPG graphics were well-designed and the shading showed adequate experience in ZZT graphics. The subtle animations were dutifully worked on.\n\nGameplay... I think this game really shines here. I like the concept of collecting spells from different sources and using them in RPG-battles everywhere. RPG Battles have now become commonplace, ever since probably 1999, but the Fury Spell works it out fine.

The graphics were well-done, including a very nicely thought-out theme screen that you see after playing a few boards. There were few musical additions, but those that existed were good enough.\n\nThe fighting system is balanced, I must think A great difficulty with designing RPGs, roguelikes, or ZZT games which simulate them is probably how to make the game not too hard in the beginning or not too easy to the end. Coolzx seemed to have playtested it enough to make it challenging yet not overboard throughout hte whole game.

With the help of Tyrone and the Boys in Blue, she tries to stop Steve before he blows up the entire city. The plot\'s a rip of Parasite Eve, and I like it.\n\nSo I like the plot. So why 2/5?

Having all the cameos in the game explode horribly was neat, as was the effect of having Flatcoat Lab explode and \'turn into\' a dark grey charred corpse was neat. The idea of having a third, locked file with a proper ending also adds to the gameplay, and the third file is admittedly engaging, having mini-games and a battle with craNKGod. But the game is less than the sum of these parts.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, I like Tseng games for the most part; I just find this one severely lacking.

Compared to recent releases, it\'s great. But, in the long run only good.\n\nThe first thing that struck me about the game was it\'s music. It started to sound like it was very good. And it is, sometimes. The music seems to have no direction and takes wierd turns. But it is used properly and is never tedious. The music is used not just to add depth to a scene, but to add an atmosphere, and that\'s the most you can ask.\n\nThe graphics are spot on. Good shading and drawing on buildings andsuch. The forests are a little lack lustre, but I really enjoyed the caves. They even had stagmites. Sadly there were very few art boards.\n\nSo the graphics were good and the music was good. What went wrong?\n\nWell, it was partly the gameplay. It might\'ve been easier for those young\'uns out there who can remember every Tekken move on the face of the planet (i think there are 2 million?) but it just either didn\'t translate well into ZZT or i\'m just dyslexic. I was able to kill, but mainly avoid, my enemies, but it just didn\'t lend itself to aiding the rest of the game. The concept is great, don\'t get me wrong, but having to do diffenrt co-ordinated moves while surrounded on all sides by monsters was confusing. Plus I was never really clear as to what event lead to you using your powers. Probably just missed that though.\n\nThe buggy battle system might\'ve been masked as better than it was if you didn\'t have so many chances to experiment with it. You need to fight, or in my case avoid (another flaw, you could get through a lot of the game with little challange.) a lot of monsters in a lot of areas. This lent to frustration as a dying player could not properly execute his moves whilst surrounded my ten monsters. Well, for this sort of battle system, I would\'ve prefered less monsters with more skill, that way you can have a nice 1 on 2, 1 on 3 battle with creatures that knew their way around the ring making battle a little more interesting.\n\nNext we have the story. Now in this day we are coming short on good RPG stories because all of the easy ones are taken. So it\'s fair to say that the story is a good spin on some things that have been done before. It\'s not bad, I enjoy familiarity, total originallity is reallt hard. Look at my games, a zombie game and  on based on Wolfestein. But I digress from the topic.\n\nRebirth, The Uprising is a good game, it really is.

The pacing is good, but the characterization is so-so. The plotline is above average, but the grammar and spelling are often downright painful. In short, the writing is a mixed bag.\n\nGraphics:\n\nNice. Can\'t fault the graphics, really.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe use of a combo system adds vitality to what has become an otherwise stale combat system (walk up to creatures, touch, back off, repeat), and shows immense promise. However, this gimmick, which is also applied pretty well to some puzzles, isn\'t quite exploited as well as it could be. Also, as ZZT has a bit of a reaction time problem, the controls are more than a little finicky.\n\nThe non-combat gameplay, however, is marred by horrendous bugs. Even in the ostensibly fixed version, I ran into a fatal passage error. Attempting to fix the problem, I found that the file\'s boards were ordered in a confusing enough manner that I ended up viewing most of the remaining game before I corrected the problem. This is not good.\n\nIn addition to the killer passage, there were several points at which objects sent messages that were, for some reason, either never received or just misinterpreted. \"BAD COMMAND\" errors even popped up now and then, which is certainly NOT a good thing.\n\nSeveral objects referred to one of the characters by the name of another, and the game used two different spellings of the villain\'s name.

Treking through a monster/robot is engaging and it\'s neat to see all the different parts of the body. The puzzles incoperate flags accross many different boards; while a standard now, it certainly was not in 1991. Then when you think the game will sucumb to the archetypes of 1991 standards and you just know that the last boss will be shooting in four directions and throwing an ungodly amount of stars, he doesn\'t. And instead you playfully chase him around the room until you catch him. The graphics were great and sometimes very humourous.

It really go out on a limb to create something both original and fun for the player, and it succeeds. Because this is a very complex game, I will attempt to devide everything into sections, yet somethings will bleed over.\n\nStory: From the begining I thought the story was good. I was pleasently suprised when by the end of the game it got even better. The tribulations between the mysterious Dark elves (The drow) and the light elves of the overworld, made for a wonderful contrast in moods as the game progressed from the nice village to the wild forest, to the cave, to the drow lair. There was plenty of history provided along with details of cultural differances. There was a nice twist and a good ending that did leave me feeling that there should be a sequal. My onlt qualm with the story, which is more of the writer\'s choice, was the fact that it didn\'t seem epic. Even though it only happened in an area maybe 2 miles wide it still could\'ve captured more of a scope. Look at Diablo, it only takes place underneath one town!\n\nGraphics: In standard IF style the graphics were well polished and added very much to the overall feel of the game. The first file was the most impressive with lovely cottages and well drawn forest scene. I\'ve seen better caves, but in general the proper atmosphere was set and the gradual transformation from cave to lair was a very mood setting effect. The cutscenes at the end of the game were what really set the second file apart from the first and the last board was a great capstone to the entire game.\n\nGameplay: Nothing spectacular here. The standard run up and touch a creature to death. Something I\'m not to good at and I had to play the game a few times to survive till the end. It was good challange but in the end my tactic was to avoid as much as possible, making for a game without gameplay. Had battle been a little less of a hassle, then there would be more fun. (YAY another thing to kill!) There was little exploration in the forest, yet the caves made up for it which in this case was a bad thing. I expected that the caves would be built around the same semi-linear fashion as the forest. Yes this is somewhat a bad call on me, but once again I had to play  through a few times. This time the reason was not dying, although I did my fair share of that, it was lack of torches. I had to play through a few times finding out where everything was before loading it back up and running through doing what I had to do before the life-sustaining light ran out. In the caves another gameplay change is the addition of a \"gun\" actually its magic but you get the ability to now shoot at yuor enemies. I\'m torn on this one. It seemed the proper thing to do, but also it seemed like the programmer(s) were making it easier for you. In the caves, you could no longer avoid your enemies as well as you could before. This makes me wonder if even the programmers technique in the forest was avoiding enemies. Not a good sign.\n\nMusic: Better than what I can do, I\'m jealous. Used perfectly.\n\nThe Puzzle: Well, this thing haunted me for nights after playing it. Usually in slider puzzles you know what order they are supposed to go in, in this puzzle you need to figure it out. I think I must\'ve missed something early in the game that would have helped me with what it was supposed to read because this thing took me as long to beat as the rest of the game. Clever and a good piece of programming, but it could be a game unto itslef and SEVERLY ruins the pace and mood the entire first file was attempting to create.\n\nOverall: One of the best games ZZT has ever seen.

Essentially a parody of the Parasite Eve game, it\'s handled quite well, from the RPG battles to the cinema sequences that are almost the same as the originals (I dont count the dialog in the similarity).\n\nThe game starts with Gem Hunter and Kim playing a game of 5-card stud poker. They had taken a bet: if Kim wins, she gets to drag Gem Hunter wherever she would like to for the night. Kim wins, and she takes Gemmy (\"I TOLD you to quite callimg me Gemmy!!\") to an opera at Migraine Hall.\n\nIt all stays the same; just incredibly boring, until the people start setting fire. One of the actors is possessed by Steve, who has control of the Xamboxumbadria in all beings. And so, Kim must stop Steve.\n\nThe battles are handled quite well, with te ability to attack your enemy, use special attacks, or heal yourself. It\'s a lot more involved than most other ZZT RPGs, all because of the variety in ways you can attack (instead of \"ATTACK\" and \"DEFEND\"). While waiting for your AT gauge to charge, you must dodge the attacks of the enemy. Its usually more fun if you set the ZZT game speed up by 3 notches. Add to that, you have 3 equippable weapons, and the ability to find new items and November Energy abilities to use on enemies (or yourself).\n\nThe cinema sequences, which are used to advance the story A LOT, are handled like most other ZZT games. It takes a while to see where all the characters are, and what they\'re doing. The dialog is entirely done using message row text (and since this isnt MZX, its flashing, but I can deal with it).

However, like most artists his skills do not extend too far beyond his chosen art. Remember Picasso\'s novels, or Van Gogh\'s symphonies? No? Exactly.\n\nThe title screen is spectacularly unappealing, but the intro sequence is nothing less than gorgeous (the picture of the planet is probably the nearest ZZT will ever get to photo-realism). The art, however, serves to highlight how dreadful Chase is at writing - not just in composing sentences (\"When the clash of swords echo [sic], the journey chasing the past ends, and the journey to know today begins..\"), but also in knowing exactly how to pace his drama. For a guy who wants to become CAPTAIN HOLLYWOOD, Chase sure doesn\'t seem to understand how stories should work. Take the second intro screen, for example; the player is treated to a fantastic animated picture of our hero - one so detailed that his mouth and eyes move, and his hair sways in the breeze. Now a GOOD storyteller would - well, *tell the story* and leave all the pretty animations as pleasant background details. Not Chase though! He has us sit there and be told that \"A calm wind brushes against your face. You close your eyes and breathe deeply\" (cue animation) \"BLAH BLAH you look down at the courtyard\" (cue animation) \"BLAH BLAH you watch people walking by\" (cue animation) until we really *understand* how much detail has gone into the graphics. Of course, this is horrible to sit through; aggressive self-aggrandizement is never a pretty sight, especially when one is trying to enjoy a story. It\'s like JK Rowling stopping in the middle of a sentence and saying \"See? Isn\'t Severus Snape a clever name? Doesn\'t it just sound all EVIL?\" - it\'s ugly, intrusive and makes the author look like a twat.\n\nSadly, Chase is unable to maintain the high level of graphics throughout the game; though the mountainside looks fantastic and some of the smaller villages are alright, pretty much all of the first city is horrible. Take the inside of the king\'s castle for example - Chase relies too much on diffused shading, so that everything lacks definition; walls blend into the floor blends into the carpets that almost hide tiny blue soldiers. In something like VGA it would have been okay, but when you have as few \"pixels\" as ZZT provides, the screen just looks like a jumble of random blobs. Yes you can pick out shops and fountains if you look closely, but the player shouldn\'t have to strain to make out where they\'re going. If the graphics are the best thing about this game and they aren\'t even all that good, you should have a rough idea of how fun this is to play.\n\nOkay, let\'s move along then shall we? The plot itself concerns a young man who is sent on a mission to get taxes from asuidsuifoh -- sorry, I lost consciousness and hit the keyboard with my head. Where was I? Oh right; this lad needs to get taxes for his king, who aims to get the four crystals of s;zghkljda -- crap, I did it again. Uhm, so this lad goes to the village but finds that they\'re suffering attacks by bandits rxzgkjhoih --oh look, I can\'t do it; the plot\'s just too dull. It may well have been ripped off from Suikoden - I haven\'t played that game - but at least there you apparently had an expansive game world and decent gameplay. Here you get-- well, let\'s take a look shall we?\n\nAfter the intro (which lasts about fifteen years), the first bit of \'gameplay\' involves asking a guard for a password so you can leave the castle. Why on EARTH would you need a password to LEAVE the king\'s castle? Not only is this bit really stupid, it serves no purpose but to further delay the game proper. Whilst little stupid things like this may make the game last longer, it\'s something of a false economy. What\'s the point of making the game last another five minutes if those five minutes are boring? If Chase had put in some proper puzzles (perhaps you needed to knock a guard dog out with some poisoned meat) then at least the player would spend their time doing something entertaining.\n\nSo you leave the castle and enter the (very ugly and pixilated) village. Again, you have to do a series of small but annoying and pointless little actions before the game can progress - go to the weapon shop, then return home to watch a cinema then FINALLY get the chance to leave the town and get on with the game. Frankly, this could have been solved by just being given a big sword and sent on your way ala Ned the Knight (which is surely the template for such games), but no! Instead you have to be introduced to your father, sister, friend and servant who all talk EXACTLY THE SAME. Seriously; there are no distinguishing features between any of these characters, except for their names and sexes. No doubt some of them will be bumped off as the series progresses but Chase is going to have to buck up his writing if he expects us to care about them.\n\nRight, we\'re outside and introduced to the crappiest world map ever. Firstly, there are the RPG battles - blue boxes \"randomly\" open up with the option to either fight or flee the baddies. In practice, this involves both sides attacking each other and doing *the same amount of damage each time*. Seriously, would it have been so hard to knock up a randomizer, or at least give more options than just \"attack\" and \"run\"? All bad guys of the same type do the same amount of damage and take the same amount of attacks to kill. No variations, no spectacular hidden moves - why not just subtract 15 health and then die? Hell, sometimes you can\'t even run so your options are \"fight\" or - er - \"fight\". And you still have to select the option, which just makes it even more irritating.\n\nWorse, there are little objects running about the maps that engage you in arcade-style fights, so that you have to barge into them a few times before they die. There\'s nothing to stop them attacking you during RPG fights, so that in-between the blue boxes you can be losing health from a pack of bats or something.\n\nAnd I haven\'t even started on the random deaths in the mountains! Stand too close to the edge and you\'ll die without warning! Push the wrong boulder and you\'ll die without warning! Step on a pressure plate and spears?ll skewer you! Question: Since when has arbitrary death ever been fun? Answer: NEVER!\n\nAnd what about the \'proper\' RPG battles? Lifeless. You do damage on bad guys but there\'s no real indication (No flashing \"YOU DID DAMAGE TO THEIF 2!\" or injury animations), and the moves are distinctly unimaginative. In fact, the RPG fight against the cave thieves stuck after a bit, so I had to zap my way out.\n\nWhich reminds me! The game has tonnes of bugs. Accidentally fail to select a name in the intro screen and you\'ll be stuck looking at your character\'s hair waving in the breeze forever. Accidentally fail to say yes or no to the chap in the castle and again you\'ll be stuck until you restart. Enter your house again after the \"father/sister\" cinema and you\'ll be flung to the start (though that might be a ZZT problem due to filesize). Only one of the exits from the cave leads to the correct cinema - the rest go straight to the fight. Gimlio\'s \"Dragon\" attack (I wonder where Chase \'borrowed\' that from?) does nothing at all. These and many more mistakes appear throughout the game, frequently resulting in reloads. Apparently three people beta tested this game. Presumably they just skipped through a lot of it, because there\'s simply no plausible way that they could complete it without finding at least one crippling bug. And let\'s not forget the spelling mistakes! Chase is hardly the most literate gent in the universe, and though Herc did his best to find all of them, there are still little mistakes here and there (including a classic your/you\'re mix-up).\n\nThis is a horrible, horrible game. It splutters and misfires repeatedly, is no fun to play whatsoever, has a thoroughly boring plot and even its best features - the graphics - are not without their problems. Final Fantasy gets a 0.5 for graphics and nothing for anything else. Do us a favour and learn from your mistakes, Chase.

There is little direction given to us as we procede. instead seemingly insignificant choices lead to our successes and failures, and (as the game poigantly illustrates) failure occours more often than success. Then we get to the shooting. the only actual shooting in the game is hardly a challange. You go into a classroom, and kill students, who are all alligned in a row waiting and come at you pretty much one at a time. no skill is required to get to the room, or even kill the students. in fact, if it\'s only the first time you\'ve played the game then you usually think that you\'ve come to the room accidently.

As a game, Planets is only so-so. Controlling your ships is cumbersome. This can be forgiven to a certain extent - it *is* a ZZT game, and you\'ve only got a few keys on the keyboard to work with. However, there are still a couple of glaring problems. For one, the programming is not idiot-proof. You have to be very careful when you move your ships, because it is possible to break the game. Attacking other ships (and the other player\'s planet) can be confusing. There isn\'t much strategy involved - both sides have the same number of ships, and all ships are equal, as far as I can tell. There are a few sound effects, but no music. The ending is lackluster.\n\nNow that that\'s out of the way, I\'ll tell you what I like about Planets. The engine is innovative and very ambitious. It is a *turn-based strategy game in ZZT*, and as far as I know, it\'s the only one. The execution might not be stellar, but it isn\'t a horrible game either - it\'s fun to engage enemy ships and watch the health meters with suspense. The graphics are pretty good, too. What really strikes me, though, is that it was written in 1996, a year before ZZT was released as freeware. Now, I\'m pretty sure this wasn\'t the first engine game ever, but it\'s early, it\'s advanced, and I\'m surprised I haven\'t heard of it before (or seen a similar type of game in ZZT).\n\nIt\'s not a brilliant game, but it does offer some entertainment value, and it\'s a clever little engine.

His plot is able to sequence very well, despite that this is much the opposite in some dreams, coming objects from the far past and the present, such as kings, queens, and Nintendo 64s. And be aware that it is a dream, or it will not make any sense to the player. The gloomy, yet excellent music and the dark graphics set the mood of the game. The contrasting colors of the last few art boards create an amazing effect and feeling as the sky is set ablaze. Wil conjures up such thoughts as an adolescent superhero, psychic powers, and a sky flaming with color as a single flower descends to the ground.

The game is set in the 10th and 11th centuries AD, during the Heian period in Japan when Kyoto was known as Heiankyo. The game includes episodes drawn from a large body of tales, legends and illustrated literature produced during or after the Heian period. These vignettes are edited into interactive, experiental forms, to allow the user to realistically sense the worldview and lifestyle of an ancient time. The game was inspired by The Tales of Genji and similar Japanese folktales.\nYour character in the game is a no-name male traveler, an ordinary human being who is faced with opportunities, driven by desires, and is bound to die. Your actions determine your path through this world, and many reincarnations to come. You may meet troublemakers, and demons, enter Paradise or Hell, be reborn, and re-enact the story of a scholar who played the devil in a high-stakes game of backgammon. In addition to very well-drawn authentic backgrounds, the game includes an excellent database of over 400 screens of text and pictures that gives background information for the time and place where you are in the game.\n\nCalling Coolart a \"game\" is a bit misleading-- you don\'t get to solve any elaborate puzzles in traditional point-and-click adventure sense. Any item you carry with you will be used automatically when the time comes, so you can\'t really get \"stuck\" in the game. Coolart is better described as an interactive story that lets you interact with the game world at your leisure, similar to choose-your-own-adventure books. And what a world it is. The designers spare no pretense, no illusion that this is a \"politically correct\" or \"family\" game. Heiankyo comes alive before your very eyes, with all the gory details and harrowing images that its inhabitants truly faced or believed. You will come across a dog eating a corpse\'s entrails, long-winded old farts, a monk leading a prayer meeting, kids playing ball in the streets, a maiden with an obscenely phallic tongue, and many more true-to-life characters. And when you get to the underworld (yes, you *must* die in this game. Several times, in fact), you will find hellish scenes populated with sharp-toothed demons and tormented souls that are so effective as to churn your stomach. These characters are drawn with vivid facial characteristics, a cross between the cartoons of medieval Japanese art and the exaggerations of modern Japanimation. The speaking voices are filled with personality, often taunting, teasing, or sexy. They all speak Japanese (in the ancient tongue, no less), but all speech is subtitled in English.\n\nWhat makes Coolart truly remarkable is that as you enter the town and interact with its inhabitants, you have only two choices. You can, in your arrogance, remain as you are, a contemporary Japanese or American, for example. And you won\'t get very far. The structure of relations that are the real art of the work won\'t let you. It does not allow this nonchalance with meaning. A more interesting choice is to try and understand the world as it would have appeared to a person of the time. Then you start to make your decisions, when you meet the guard, or the priest, or the gambler, according to someone else\'s meaning making map of Kyoto, and indeed of the world. You work within the constraints the artists have placed in the matrix of relations that are the art of this work. The look and feel of it are just window dressing. They are not art, they are design. The art is the in the relations. Follow along the line of those relations, and you learn what it means to be in the world as the world appears from the point of view of Pure Land Buddhism.\n\nAs Roger Ebert concludes in his review, \"There is the sense, illusory but seductive, that one could wander this world indefinitely.

Wells','kokolhe1@yahoo.com','The Kane Project 4 is, well, a lot like most of the other games Master Raze has made.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe cutscenes are passable, and sometimes good. However, the gameplay boards are generally rather flat and lifeless. The streets of the city look rather like a typical dungeon, except with walls of big, blue blocks that are meant to represent rooftops, and the final battle looks particularly lackluster.\n\nWriting:\n\nWell, my expectations were pretty low here, and Master Raze met them. TKP4 is filled with flat situations and sophomoric humor so overstated as to make MY jokes look subtle - which is no mean feat. Its plotline manages to be stale yet maintain a charming incomprehensibility at times. Also, a proofreader would be welcome here.\n\nBut there is one good line about the habits of serial killers in movies...\n\nGameplay:\n\nMany games have predictable plots, but Master Raze has managed to do the seemingly impossible. He has managed to combine a variety of different types of action, and yet still keep the entire game on a predictable track.\n\nThe reason for this is as follows: anybody who has played Master Raze\'s other games - and I know there are a few others of you out there - has seen all there is to see here, pretty much. There are one or two ideas he hasn\'t used before, but most of the game is very familiar.\n\nI mean, what other author could possibly make you say:\n\n\"Okay, a break-in sequence is coming up, so that means I\'ll have to access some computers to open doors, sneak behind guards to break their necks, maybe hide from some cameras, and possibly get a password. Afterwards, I\'ll end up in a forest or jungle or something, pursued by animals that I really shouldn\'t kill, because I don\'t want to run out of ammo. There might be some fistfighting action, which basically amound to touching objects instead of shooting them. The objects might run away when I chase them while simultaneously decreasing my health.\"\n\nIt\'s not BAD gameplay, for the most part, but it\'s getting old fast.\n\nOverall:\n\nEffort definitely went into this on some level; all of those cutscenes and battles didn\'t come out of thin air. But it all feels suspiciously like a Mr. Potato Head approach to design; begin with a dull, plastic thing and add on the premade parts. This is very popular in Hollywood; I mean, TKP4 is AT LEAST as original as [insert latest buddy action movie here], but Raze could do a lot better.',3,'2003-03-31','131.215.90.164\r',1656),(451,'Not bad','YipplyYAya','squirtlerulez@yahoo.com','This game was rather entertaining...though i don\'t like it. Its graphics were not bad though. for another opinion, refer to below...\nI hate Role Playing Games. For so many reasons over so many years, I have never gotten the same enjoyment from them that others have. I never liked the cute cartoony characters or turn based combat, nor today\'s FMV smothered fodder crammed with heroes named \'\'Squall Valiannartessions.\'\' The only reason I ever gave Nipple Saga a chance was its name; I love the Nipple games so I got it. I never expected to like it, and really never expected to love it. Truth be told, it is one of the greatest games ever released and really deserves all the hype that other RPGs now get. The Game This is one damn fine playing game. The story revolves around a young man named Nippleanus, member of a crew performing freelance missions for der Doktor. The ship is overtaken and Nippleanus\'s own Doctor (and surrogate father, essentially) is slain before him by der Doktor von Bagstein himself. Before you get knocked unconscious, you witness Bagstein\'s men steal an artifact resembling a coffin from some ruins... then comes the pistol whippin\'. You black out, and arise at the bottom of a cave, feeling hopeless. Your anus comes to your rescue, and so the adventure begins... The game has three basic playing modes: Flying around on your anus, exploring on foot, and combat on the anus. All are well implemented; the majority is on the anus, and controlling it is as natural as could be. The game will send you flying across large bodies of water, through ravines, over tundra; the flying is very similar to the preceding Nipple games, only not as deft (these are exploration sequences). Pressing the A button brings up the targeting icon; anything accessible can be highlighted and interacted with via this system. It comes together perfectly for an RPG, especially considering how much of it is rooted in shooter. The on-foot moments are actually similar to the flying; you roam around, but all interaction takes place with the targeting icon. While sounding awkward simply for running, it is really quite fitting; often there are several items you can look over, and you can choose among them without moving around. The game\'s combat system is phenomenal. Forget all the boring turn-waiting and cutesy stuff; Nipple Saga came to play. It isn\'t as fast as the shooter iterations, as this is an RPG, but the pacing of the battles is amazing. You\'re given a set of meters that fill over time. You can perform certain tasks according to your amount of meters filled; thus the give-or-take strategy planning begins. Do you hit with a bunch of one meter attacks, or wait for some more powerful 2 meter attacks? Time can be of the essence, and some of the more epic battles will have your hands sweating as you try to decide the best course of action. As you play on, the Doctor evolves and changes into new Robo-Doctor types. This means he\'s more powerful and more resilient towards attacks, just as Nippleanus is when gaining experience. When your Doctor learns Berserk commands, you\'re given a whole new class of \'\'spells.\'\' The intervals at which you\'re given access to the new features is perfect; you get them right when you\'re ready for something new. There is also NO need for \'\'leveling up.\'\' The game makes sure that if you play the game through, you will be powerful enough without ever having to spend useless time fighting ridiculous amounts of repetitive enemies just to feel adequate. Thematically, Nipple Saga (as well as all of the Nipple games) has no equal. The enemies you fight, the doctor, the quirky people you meet- this is a far away universe that really should be closer. The range of monsters really makes it seem as if the world you\'re venturing through has different species and classes; not just random ugly creatures, but actual populations living amongst the humanoids. The areas and levels are very appropriate residences for the characters, accurate and fitting without exception. The story goes on to become so much more than it starts with; the importance of the being in the coffin, etc. It all comes together almost without hitch. The sole problem in its execution is that it can be hard to discern a few alliances towards the end of the game; this doesn\'t kill the story at all, but is rather just a bur in the saddle. Play the game through over a short period of time and the story will reward you like few others in gaming. Side note: While it says on the back of the case that NS offers the \'\'Uncompromising Conclusion\'\' to the Nipple lineage, that is FAR from the truth. The ending is not bad, but it is NOT what is advertised... The Delivery Nipple Saga has it\'s graphical highs and lows. The shimmering water is the best seen on the PC (or the XBox), and the Doctor is a beautiful model considering the hardware. He bends and maneuvers beautifully; in fact all the animations of the game are excellent. Berserk effects are also dynamite, with plenty of pretty colors and lighting erupting from the attacks. The game even fakes some great reflections in a few areas, a feat never handled with much grace by the ZZT. The lows however, are some pretty gritty looking structures in the walking segments, and some rough character models for the human(oid)s. This is 32 bit 3D stuff here, so it isn\'t bad at all considering the hardware, it just isn\'t the best of its league. The overall visual presentation is still superb; the theme is rendered exquisitely and the intentions of the developer are well executed. The music is almost eerily fitting. It\'s as if the levels themselves designed the music; from the bongo-style rhythms of Dir en Grey to the digital woodwinds of Initial D music, the stuff is the aural representation of the visuals. The track that accompanies regular outdoor battles is a perfect example; no other track could ever capture the moment like that, as it blends the constant motion and primitive-yet-advanced theme the game so brilliantly delivers. The Truth I once thought I would never review this game simply because I don\'t think I could do it justice. Although I overcame that hurdle, this review is far from doing right by Nipple Saga. It is worth its ridiculous prices on ebay. I hate RPGs and this is still one of the best games I\'ve ever played. Ignore the commercials on TV for so many other games you\'ll be able to rent to find out they aren\'t worthy. Nipple Saga is amazing, stellar; how could the ZZT not succeed with JUST this game on it?

The descriptions are verbose enough to please while the The humor (in my horrible opinion; rating humor is a purely subjective task) ranged from slightly droll to pretty amusing; nothing was horrible save for what was intended to be horrible (well, except maybe the horse joke).  The plot, while truthfully less relevant than it was when Wells originally started work on ESP, was implemented very well. It involves a tricky man named Cleatle who sneaks into the Protest Party headquarters and suggests confuddling up the ballot system to gain more votes.  Despite his means of entering, he\'s inducted into the Protest Party and is sent out to get the ballot scanned.  The rest clumps together in an odd mess from there on, and I\'d rather not give out plot points on a strongly written game when the game itself does ton(ne)s better.\n\nOh, let me point out that I noticed two typos thoughout playing the game.  TWO.  Considering there\'s enough text to fill at least a novelette and _especially_ considering that this is a homebrewed game, that\'s about as likely as ...ah hell, I can\'t come up with a simile that won\'t make me sound elitist. :&lt;  But you get the picture!\n\nAs for the gameplay, the inventory game was well-programmed.  Several (and I mean SEVERAL) specific but pointless inventory reactions were put in. Also, some of the puzzles were pretty devious. (I ended up using the help file twice; once to get that pocketwatch and the other because I was blind and couldn\'t see a docked boat.)\n\nThe action scenes are widly varying; they range from simple bullet evasion to a run\'n\'gun type game.  About the only flaw is the large head start you can get in the first minigame, but that\'s nothing game-destroying.\n\n(For those of you just in for the story, pretty much all of the action scenes can be skipped over.)\n\nThe artwork thoughout is quite sharp.  Funk contributed to the first file; Zenith to the second and fourth; Rob_P to the third.  The art styles, while abviously varying from artist to artist, didn\'t conflict heavily enough to cause problems.\n\nIt\'s nice, really!

Does it hold up to the hype?\n\nYes. Altough I was disapointed slightly. Because this is a massive game, (4 files) I\'m going to have to resort to dividing up the review into sections.\n\nStory: The premise is very clever, and it\'s one thing to have a clever premise, it\'s another to be able to follow through with it to the end. Wells, who is known for his attention to writing, can support his bark with his bite. The game is layered and while some of the things within the game become absurd and seem to have little to do with the main point, it all flows and aids in creating a world where it might be possible that a group of Sorcerers might take over and hypnotise people to win an election. Sometimes however things get to detracted and by the time you get back to the main story, you\'re confused as to what had been going on. The sections in between are as wordy as the main plot and while it maintains the writing standard that is somewhat expected, though not entirely necessary, it puts much between the main theme of the game and the side parts.\n\nGameplay: For a game thick with story ESP still squeezes out a good amount of gameplay. You can skip a lot of it and you can also cheat to great degree as allowed by the programmer. The engines were well done for the most part. The RPG battle was a little stale albiet humourous. (On a separate note the boat ride was similar to one my airplane engines hehe:)) The shooting game play plays a bit weak and some scenes incorperate stars which in my opinion should be avoided at _almost_ all costs. In general though the gameplay, while varied, was not totally entertaining, skipping it seemed wrong though and I felt left out of the action of the game. The fact that you switched between characters was a good feature though that added depth to both the gameplay and the story.\n\nMusic: I think I might be the only one to notice that the title screen music was a poor rendition of \"VGA Trek\". The music was very good in some parts and annoying in other parts. But there was music throughout which while a feature for most games to-day, is hardly the standard for ZZT games.\n\nGraphics: Ranged from awesome to radical. There was depth, perspective. Some of the best graphics I\'ve seen in ZZT and even better than some MZX games. The combination of artisits is noticible but does not detract from te game at all.\n\nOverall: The graphics and the story make up the brunt of the \"game\". Given the option of being able to skip a lot of the playing parts, it plays more like an interactive movie. This is the problem with ZZT, get too involved in story and it\'s hard to make the game a game. ESP is one of the best things to come around in a while, but there are still better games out there. I\'d give it a five for the sake of effort on the parts of all the programming writing and drawing, but if that\'s what earns a movie five stars, The Core will sweep the Oscars next time around.',4.5,'2003-04-03','68.112.244.46\r',1662),(459,'NEEDS WORK','NOne','','YEah I agree with the 1St review also What I was think that player 2 was use by diffent contorlls\nThis game needs Work',1,'2003-09-06','216.209.111.171\r',5),(460,'needs work','c','','Yeah It needs work like how fast or take a wav file and convert or someting like that be great Idea still somone out there will hack it and make it better happen to my firend how sold his game when it got a bad rating then they fixed it and then got a good rating',1.5,'2003-09-06','216.209.111.171\r',1669),(461,'\"Look, Ozy!

Is this a bad thing? Well, that\'s a matter of taste, I suppose, but there\'s no way Nadir\'s technical skill can be faulted here, nor his sense of timing. This is a fun game.\n\nPlot:\n\nThe plotline is fairly standard RPG stuff; we get an ominous hint in the opening that Something Bigger is happening, and then the game jumps to the main character, a teenager who makes a rather important discovery about herself, like all teenage RPG heroes. No, she isn\'t heir to the throne or anything like that, nor do her parents suddenly get killed off, but the device that\'s used here is still pretty ageworn.\n\nThe game continues along a fairly predicatable track, with some pretty common stock scenes and a \"find a pet\'s owner\" quest. Nothing immensely original, but it could be worse; it could be incomprehensible (see most trippy games).\n\nWriting:\n\nBut even the most tired plot can be made to shine with solid writing, and, thankfully, Zenith pulls through here. The characters are satisfactory, and the pacing is excellent. Clunky exposition is kept to a minimum - although, as the first game is meant to set up the world, there is definitely some there - and the dialogue isn\'t overlong.\n\nI, personally, find the authorial interjections annoying. At times, Zenith clearly puts his own catchphrases and bits of random silliness in the mouths of the characters. Even worse, it occasionally... OCCASIONALLY got a laugh from me, so I couldn\'t quite ignore it, either. That\'s a nasty thing to do, throw inanities around and then surprise me with humor. For shame.\n\nOf course, I consider the amount of cursing excessive. What else is new?\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay sections of Frost 1 are solid. There\'s a swordplay Simon Says sequence and a bunch of forest and swamp screens with monsters to fight. This isn\'t anything new, but it\'s done very smoothly and competently. The monsters require a bit of work to beat sometimes - and there\'s one really great moment of blind panic. It\'s telegraphed, but that somehow makes it better.\n\nThe game does take a bit of time to get going, but once it does, it does. I prefer to think of the pacing as \"excellently done and unhurried,\" as opposed to \"long setup, no payoff yet.\"\n\nMusic:\n\nIt\'s MadTom. It\'s good, what there is of it.\n\nGraphics:\n\nSo, you can have Suikoden Fantasy, where the graphics are the best thing in the game, but are basically just look pretty, or you can have Frost 1, where the graphics are the best thing in the game, and seem to define its personality and give it a great sense of fun.\n\nProgramming:\n\nI didn\'t run into any bugs, everything was neatly executed, and the masses of enemies worked well.\n\nConclusion:\n\nA fun, if short, game.

The majority of the levels involve weaving your way through guns that shoot far too frequently and there are many times where it\'s near impossible not to be shot when bullets are comming at you from above and the side at the same time. The boss battles leave much to be desired. One of the X bots is killed by a defensive gun\'s bullets and the second one can be shot safely from underneath through the water that\'s used as a platform. Magman only needs to be shot through the feet with a stream of bullets then taken out from behind. For some odd reason his head throws stars which can\'t hurt another object.

I totally wanted to get Caves, Dungeons, and City, but I could never convince my parents to pay for them, y\'know?  I also thought it would be cool if I could send in a game board for Best of ZZT, but that never happened.\n\nAnyway, I found that the coolest part of ZZT was that the level editor could create games just like the ones that came with ZZT.  I was used to games like Think Quick that put limitations on how much you could make your games like the pre-packaged ones, so as I explored ZZT, it turned out to be a real treat to duplicate all of the tricks in Town and more.  Probably the pinnacle of ZZT\'s flexibility is its \"object-oriented\" language for programming your own game characters.  There are dozens upon dozens of ways for these objects to interact with the player and spice up the game.\n\nWhen the Internet got to be a really big thing, making ZZT games also grew in popularity.  Now you can share your work with friends all over the world and try to get some recognition.  There are plenty of places to look for free games to download.

Well this is one of them. I\'m a fan, so here\'s how it works:\nYou are Captain Rodite, a mercenary who hasn\'t been on many missions, but neither you or your ship is a slouch (though the ship could use some upgrades), and soon become caught up in the Ekul rebellion against the empire. You get the chance to upgrade main shields at the beginning, and add on ammo (required, you start with zero), shielding (constructs 4 walls, stops you, needs gems but offers perfect protection) and hyperdrive (torches, makes the ship go faster. Not useful really). The games good part are the battles, which don\'t take long but are quite fun. You fight in a control center. Pushing left or right rotates the ship that way, up shoots, and down accesses the extras. Extras will raise shields, activate hyperdrive, or use the chain cannon, which comes after the talon mission and causes you to move some when shooting, useful for destroying small, mobile enemies. There are also 2 gun battles out of the ship. When you\'re done, download the sequel, which is much shorter but involves the story finishing final battle. Like I said, I\'m a fan, and I hope that mercenary 3 comes out. This was too short since it was so good, I\'m starved for more.',5,'2003-07-17','67.217.143.56\r',1107),(581,'YAY SIRS!

I know that hyping a game isn\'t really a good idea, but this game could have used it. Massive and filled with nifty theme boards and fun puzzles, Pipeline 99 is one of the neater puzzle games I\'ve played for ZZT.\n\nThe premise is simple, and actually sort of overused; you have to arrange objects on a screen so that a ball hits a target. The devil is in the details here; a simple set of tools has to be used, so that the gameplay can be picked up, but the thing can\'t get too repetitive.\n\nStory:\n\nWell, there is a storyline here. It\'s a silly one, and is appropriately simple, but it adds a bit to the game. Furthermore, there was one really good joke, which is one more than I expected. This isn\'t Grim Fandango; this is The Incredible Machine, and any story is a bonus.\n\nMusic:\n\nWhat? No brilliant musical score in a WiL game? I don\'t think anybody cares, actually.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe player puts down special pieces on the board that redirect a little ball. Simple enough in theory, but it gets tricky when gravity gets reversed, or the ball sticks to the walls... or the thing just keeps falling into pits.\n\nIt\'s fun, really, and that\'s all I can say. It gets a bit repetitive when the game drags out to the sixtieth level or so, but an effort is made to keep things fresh and ramp up the difficulty.\n\nGraphics:\n\nWorkmanlike; anything complicated would get in the way of the engine, actually.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis one\'s worth a download. It was ignored in its time, so a lot of you have some catching up to do. I don\'t expect many people will play all of the levels (a branching system, like that of Little Square Things, would have worked better), but it\'s good to know they\'re there.',4.5,'2003-09-20','131.215.158.186\r',870),(617,'KEWL','Druss','','one of the greatest clasic games known to zzt! awesome!',5,'2003-08-19','213.107.224.4\r',378),(618,'','tucan','otterjoe@aol.com','i\'m not sure how this slipped by everyone... but i guess that\'s because i\'m probably old enough to remember Kudzu. one of the classics of ZZT gaming, it goes without saying.\n\nit\'s a weird little thing, but that\'s one of its virtues i suppose. for the first time, people realized that ZZT games didn\'t necessarily have to resemble anything on Super Nintendo. the games you make can be as boundlessly weird as you like.',5,'2003-08-19','24.44.9.61\r',644),(619,'OMG, IT\'S CRAP LOL','Zandor','jtabor12@yahoo.com','Druss: He\'s an admin or a super-duper mod or something, he has special powers\'n\'crap.

Warning, spoilers galore.)\n\nZenith\'s first full ZZT game in three years is a full-blown triumph, a graphical masterpiece with original characters, an intriguing storyline, a cohesive, well-developed and depicted setting ... and the gameplay isn\'t half bad, either.\n\n*Frost 1: Power* is a cinema game based on characters that Zenith has apparently been brooding on for a long time, perhaps years. Some of you might recognise, for example, the character Henna in prototype form from his art compilation *UltraWack*, which was released way, way back when your grandfather was learning about STK, and, much more recently, from the infamous KrackeNadir art journal.\n\nThe graphics are the game\'s main strength, which is not really surprising for a self-confessed cinema game, and, at the risk of sounding like I\'m exaggerating (I\'m not), I\'ve never actually seen anything quite like it, particularly the art boards. Light and shadow are used very effectively, and the attention to detail is pretty astonishing. Zenith\'s trademark skylines, such as the purple-grey sky of the first \'teaser\' board of the game involving a character named Set, are used to full effect, including consistency with descriptions of weather ... he said it was overcast, and he meant it!\n\nThe gameplay, when you finally reach it after the marathon introduction, is simple; Penny Shaïwell, upon being exiled from her homeland of Gian, is on her way to Alsace, walking through forest and swampland, and using the sword given to her by her mother to KILL things in the process. She faces such feared opponents as polliwogs and bloodflies, and, of course, the everpresent zombie muttering such intimidating threats as \"rrrr brains\", and the task of finding the mysterious swamp witch Henna, whose unfortunately wounded pet is blocking the bridge to Alsace. All very simple, but rather nice. In fact, the only thing that *really* turned me off about the gameplay was the duplicator reproducing the enemies, though that\'s admittedly long been a pet peeve of mine.\n\nIn spite of the potentially morose atmosphere of latter parts of the game, Zenith keeps a reasonably light perspective with occasional interjections such as \"stumpy is speshul :(\", swearwords, and \"say goodbye to gian 4eva\". Which is just as well, otherwise the game might have collapsed under its own (considerable) weight. The dialogue generally flows freely and realistically; there\'s no pretentious, droning, Final Fantasy-type crap here.\n\nThe music, comprised of a mere two pieces, is my own, so I\'d best ignore that ... and yes, Zenith, I saw my goddamned <:) smiley on the squid board. I CONSIDERED PINGING YOU A POINT JUST FOR THAT I\'LL HAVE YOU KNOW, SQUIRREL BOY\n\nAll in all, *Frost 1: Power* is a tour-de-force of, in my mind, unparalleled ZZT artwork set to a well-thought-out storyline, with a level of gameplay acceptable to a cinema game, interesting characters, and pretty damn good writing. Even if it was made by a guy who, according to Flaming O, looks like John Denver.\n\nDownload it and play it now, since I\'ve pretty much spoiled the whole damned thing for you!

The all-star cast (featuring Boothe Howard, Smiley Burnette, Mr. T, and last but most definitley not least, Bob Crane as Robert \"Hulk\" Hogan) pull off an amazing performance that will send you reeling.\n\nYou take on the role of Hogan. The digital comic opens in a ring of lies: The UN. A heated arguement has started between Hogan and Mr. T, over T\'s unorthodox practice of using UN planes to fly in autographed baseballs. Just when Hogan was beginning to win, T lobs a baseball, signed by baseball legend Rolly Fingers, into the ribcage of Hogan.\n\nRobert was infuriated; what\'s a nigger doing in the UN, anyway? Hogan drives to Hot Pepper Hill, to confront his boss (Smiley Burnette). It was all a setup: Hogan is tied down and shaved, execution style. Left for dead in a laundry bag on the side of the highway, Hogan is found by Boothe Howard, who gives him hair implants, and the ability to vomit bubbles at his foes. Hogan bursts out of the doctor\'s office, and makes his way back to Hot Pepper Hill, to face his old Boss, with a mouthful of bubbles. Will Hogan succeed? With your ingenuity, maybe!\n\nThe graphics are astounding. There\'s a beautifully detailed picture of Bob Crane wearing a towel on the title screen. The locations look great, too, as they were all filmed and photographed ON LOCATION! Micr0wave cut no corners here.\n\nThe sound is a mixed bag. The dialogue is absolutely fantastic: audible, clear, and very well acted. The musical score, performed by grammy-winning orchestra \"The Pee Wee Johnnies\", leaves a bit to be desired from.

Now, three different opinions, all written up in reviews over three sentences long, mean something. Also, I notice that Zenith is in the credits. As is WiL. As is Jacob Hammond. As is Hercules. I don\'t know how this could fail.\n\nI download Death Gate and start it up; it opens well. A bunch of people are sitting around, plotting to destroy the world. They then destroy it. Nifty.\n\nIt\'s pulled from the Death Gate game, of course, which was in turn based upon a series of fantasy novels, but hey, steal from the best, right? As long as they credit the original authors somewhere... yes, there they are. Legend is mentioned at the very, very end of the game.\n\nThe game is broken up into segments, each of which is written by a different author. This is probably a good thing; having too many people work on the same scenes is a quick way to ruin a game, and probably quite a few friendships. I don\'t know; I\'ve never tried that.\n\nWow. Why didn\'t I get around to playing this earlier?\n\nAnswer: It lacks either compelling gameplay or a well-told story. The writing is weak. The thing just doesn\'t stick together as a whole.\n\nI wasn\'t missing much.\n\nThe first bad sign was the text at the bottom of the screen. It wouldn\'t have been a mortal sin, I think, if it had been well-written. Sadly, it was an ungrammatical mush of the game\'s fantasy jargon and Big Pronouncements. There were some attempts to give unique characters to the people in the game, but only the author cameos actually had real voices. I don\'t know; I guess that\'s what happens when you write yourself.\n\nOh, yes, the second bad sign was the author cameos. See, in order to put the pieces of the world back together, the player has to go to different realms and bring back the game authors. So, first the game sets up an elaborate fantasy premise, which it repeats at great length whenever possible, and then it tears down any suspension of disbelief. I don\'t know; is this meant to be cute, or clever, or just wink-wink-nudge-nudge in-joking?\n\nIn order to review Death Gate, I\'m going to have to look at each of its sections separately, though, as each has its own personality. Even if Death Gate\'s dialogue often strikes the same few notes of exposition over and over, it doesn\'t repeat itself here. The segments are quite clearly distinct.\n\nHercules\' segment:\n\nThis one begins with Lord Xar, your character\'s exposition dispenser, doing what he does best: dispensing exposition. He drones for a bit, and Hercules, who just a few seconds before was asking himself questions about the possibility of life in the other realms, listens politely to the spiel. Of course, this seemed repetitive to me, but I don\'t know.\n\nThis is probably the most interesting thing in this segment. The rest of it consists of the player walking around HercLand, talking to a few token NPCs, fetching an item, and answering a pop quiz. On ZZT.\n\nNow, I don\'t know why people include ZZT quizzes in ZZT games. First of all, it breaks the fourth wall so thoroughly that you just can\'t repair it again. Secondly, it\'s not fun. If you know the answers, you know them, and it\'s a piece of cake. If you don\'t, there\'s no real way to deduce them. You just keep trying again and again until you\'re through with the damned thing. And, of course, they become harder with time.\n\nOn the bright side, this one doesn\'t kill you if you make a mistake. You just have to start over. This alone suggests the existence of a merciful God. I don\'t know; it seems a lot better than the Prime Mover argument.\n\nSummary of HercLand: Not fun. Not interesting. No compelling characters. No real reason to keep going. Dull. I don\'t know; there might be something I\'m missing.\n\nJacob Hammond\'s segment:\n\nThis one\'s short and bizarre. The player does a nonsensical fetch-and-carry, solves a really, really simple puzzle, and, well, that\'s it. It feels sort of... dashed off. On the bright side, this one doesn\'t take itself too seriously.\n\nSummary of Jacob Hammond\'s bit: Silly. Quickly over with.\n\nZenith Nadir\'s segment:\n\nWhat\'s this? Actual gameplay? A throwaway joke opening? Two diverging paths through an action segment? Okay, we\'ve got a game, now.\n\nThat game begins with Simon, continues with Sokoban, putters along through a tricky, but generically Nadir-y, RPG/action segment, and ends with a standard action battle. Nothing original, I think, but what they hey. There\'s an effort here, and it doesn\'t exactly take itself seriously. Indiana Jones makes a brief cameo. I don\'t know; does that count as a joke, or just half a joke?\n\nIncidentally, am I the only one who thinks that those two paths through the temple are actually kind of similar? No? Darn.\n\nSummary of Zenith\'s segment: We\'ve got (pedestrian, but well-executed) gameplay!\n\nWiL\'s segment:\n\nThis was the most ambitious segment; it relies on the use of a timer and a sort of real-time adventure gameplay. In this case, \"adventure\" means \"running around frantically trying to talk to the right people at random before time runs out.\"\n\nIt could have worked, but it\'s way, way too easy to put into an unwinnable state. Now, to be fair, WiL clearly means to do this, and does warn the player, but that doesn\'t make it good design. More open-endedness would have been a good thing. I don\'t know... maybe it would have just made things messier.\n\nThere\'s another multiple-choice segment here. If you make a wrong choice at any point, which is easy to do, then you are left in Can\'t-Win Limbo. You\'ll also end up in Limbo if you aren\'t in the right place at the right time. You won\'t even know it immediately. You\'ll just flounder like a hopeless king who forgot to pick up the dead fish.\n\nNow, all of this would be sort of forgivable if the gameplay made any sense, but you\'re in a dreamworld of sorts, and that\'s WiL\'s favorite excuse for discontinuity. You just have to hope you\'re on the right boards when the timed events happen; logic won\'t get you far. I don\'t know; maybe I\'m missing something.\n\nThis is all a shame. This segment tries to raise Serious Ideas, and almost succeeds at some point; one of the key questions is whether or not we should cling to the comfort of old dreams. But the writing can\'t escape its pretension, and the attempt at connecting emotionally with the player was too much like a multiple-choice exam to really work. Sorry.\n\nSummary of WiL\'s segment: It tries.\n\nOverall:\n\nI don\'t know. Am I missing anything? Oh, yes, the graphics. Very nice graphics, I think. I didn\'t notice them much, which meant that they were good. Bad ZZT graphics tend to stand out. The music was passable, such as it was, but it wasn\'t the sort of soundtrack I\'ve come to expect from a game with WiL on board.\n\nI don\'t know. Perhaps I\'m missing some central part of the appeal of the game. The dialogue certainly seemed to repeat itself quite a bit; Lord Xar chooses the climactic moments of the game to give a tedious full recap of all the preceding events, which is a bad habit of his. Maybe repetition = good fantasy writing. I don\'t know.\n\nI don\'t know. The gameplay was generally absent. The plot was good, but the story - that thing where characters react to events and drive the action - just wasn\'t there. What can I say?

SSF II was developed and published by Capcom. SSF II marked the first appearances of four totally new character to the Street Fighter series: Cammy, Dee Jay, T. Hawk, and Fei Long were all brought into the mix. This game also brought about a new art style in the characters portraits, as well as a new announcer.\n\nWell, the graphics, despite being about seven years old, look amazing. The characters\nthemselves are huge and well animated. The game uses tons of color to enhance the feel\nof the game, this is quite evident in Balrog?s Las Vegas level. The game also features\nmany more well animated backgrounds, Chun Li?s China background is full of bikers\nspeeding past and watching the action. The game?s animation is one of its most notable\nqualities; each and every character has their own unique move set, along with it, the\ncharacters each have their own specific animations for moves, with the exception Ryu and\nKen, who share quite a bit of animation. The animation in most of the moves is as smooth\nas could be expected.\n\nThe sound is a mixed bag of epic proportions. On one hand, the in-game music is\namazing, it always fits the level. Also, you couldn?t ask for bettter sound effects, namely\nthose used for kicks, punches, and special moves, they are all amazingly done, they fit\ntheir actions perfectly. On the other hand, the announcing is weak, as are the voice quips\nfrom some of the characters. Here?s the deal, the voice pitch has been raised considerably.\nI mean, this announcer could do soprano, it?s just unbievably high. This high pitch really\ndoesn?t fit the game and actually manages to detract from the experience.\n\nThe gameplay is standard Street Fighter fare, in other words, amazing. The game has\nsome of the smoothest gameplay of any fighting game ever. Moves can be pulled off\neffortlessly, and battles can become frenetic affairs and wars of attrition. You go through\na set of opponents that changes depending on your character, if you win, you continue on,\nif you lose, you have to option to contrine. Your goal, no matter what character you play\nas, is to defeat the game?s main boss M. Bison, who is EVIL beyond all imagination.\n\nThe control is among the finest ever in gaming. The Genesis\' control pad fits this game\nlike a glove, the game?s default button layout is a perfect match to the arcade?s, making it\neasy for arcade veterans to play without having to worry about the confituration. It?s also\nvery user-freindly, if you, for whatever reason, don?t like the default control scheme, you\ncan change it. The cotrol, no matter what the configuration, is rock-solid, it?s always very\nresponsive and never misses a beat.\n\nThe game?s presentation.is the perfect mix of old-school Street Fighter with new-school\ndesigns. The game employs brand new character art that have a very anime-esque look to\nit that really fits the series well. This new art captures the ferocity in some of the\ncharacters, most notably the man-beast Blanka, it also captures the elegant side of some\ncharacters, most notably Cammy.\n\nThe game?s difficutlty is adjustable. The difficulty scale goes from one star to ten, at one\nstar, the AI is as easy as could be, offense is minimal from the CPU-controlled characters,\non the higher levels though, you will be attacked from all sides, blocking will be imperitve\nat this level. Quite frankly, the difficulty suits the game well, it?s progressive, which fits\nfighting games very well, it allows beginners to test out their skills on lover-level\nopponents, and it enables veteran players the ability to duke it out with challlenging\nopposition.\n\nThe game?s replay value is virtually limitless. There is always something new to learn in\nthe game; whether it?s a new move for you favorite character, or the timing of some\nmoves you?re having trouble with, you?re always left with something to do.\n\nThe game is a dream to play on the Nomad. The small screen doesn\'t cause any problems during gameplay, nor does the blurring, best of all, the game\'s flawless control is intact.\n\nAll in all, I love this game, it combines the best parts of the Street Fighter series. Some\nmay complain about the lack of a speed setting, but it really doesn?t affect the game much\nfor me, I prefer the slower pace anyway, I simply can?t keep up too well with it when it?s\ngoing a million miles a minute like it does on higher turbo settings in Street Fighter II\nTurbo, so I?m glad there?s no turbo setting in this game.\n\n----------------\nScore Rundown\n-----------------\n\nGraphics- 10/10- Simply stunning. The super-smooth animation and minute background\ndetails give this game a style all its own.\nSound- 7/10- The music fits each level, and character to a tee. The sound effects match\ntheir actions perfectly. However, the new announcer\'s high pitched voice brings down the game\'s sound, he actually managaes to detract from the experience.\nGameplay-10/10- Tried-and-true Street Fighter gameplay. It?s fast and furious. Some\nmay moan and groan over the lack of speed settings, but it doesn?t bother me one bit.\nControl-10/10- Simply perfect. The Genesis\' controller works wonders for this game.\nThe default control configuration matches the arcade?s, but if you don?t like it, you can\nconfigure it to your liking; either way, you?ll be getting smooth as silk, super responsive\ncontrol.\nPresentation-10/10- The new art style helps emphasize the personas of some of the\ncharacters. It?s also a very original style that fits the series.\nChallenge- 10/10- You can control your destiny. If you want a nice, easy battle, you can\ngo to a lower difficulty, if you want a tough fight that will take you to your limits, go with\na higher setting, it?s all up to you.\nReplay Value-10/10- There?s always something new to learn, whether it?s a new move, or\nthe timing of a move you already know, there?s always someting to do.\nFor Nomad Owners- This game is a must-buy. The graphics don\'t take a hit on the small screen, and blurring is nonexistant. The flawless control remains intact.\nOverall-10/10- Pure, unadulterated Street Fighter bliss. The stunning graphics, amazing\nsound and control, and classic gameplay make this game a must have.\n\n\nWait, STAR Fighter 2? What the hell is this crap?

What a great concept! This game proves that ZZT is an ideal concept for creating a MiSTing. As this is an treated as an episode of the show, I will write my review in Amazing Collasal Episode Guide format.\n\nThe Game:\n\"Godzilla vs. Planet X5\" is a boss battle game that throws you against a half dozen of the Godzilla movies most famous villians.  Obviously, you play as none other than, who else, Gamera\n\n\nNo, just kidding, it\'s Godzilla :)\n\nthe plot seems to involve our main characters, \"PVT\" and \"SGT\" throwing Godzilla from boss to boss via the \"Godzilla Transport Devive\" in some effort to stop an invasion by aliens. Or something.  The author, Jpasc123, doesn\'t seem to do a very good job fleshing out the story.  After the battles are through, we are treated to several ZZT versions of the author\'s favorite scenes from the Godzilla series.  Only about a quarter of the games screens are interactive, the rest being simple cutscenes that have to relation to the game you just played (other than featuring Godzilla).  It\'s a bit like playing one map from Gettysburg, then getting to watch one hour from Gone With The Wind.  Horrible spelling, typos, and grammer abound, making the text seem almost Dr. Thinker like in quality.  The boards are decently designed, and better writing and more interactivity would have definately helped this game.\n\nSegment One:\nThanks to a black hole, Mike &amp; the \'bots find themselves transformed into ZZT characters.  Crow notes that he is now an accented lowercase E.  Pearl takes advantage of the situation by sending Mike \"Godzilla vs. Planet X5\" on the ships main navagational computer.\n\n[henceforth, all segments take place in the theater]\n\nSegment Two:\nGypsy informs everyone that the ship is on a collision course. Since the game is running on the main computer, gypsy can\'t turn the ship or stop.  Mike suggests using the \"#walk idle\" command, which the \'bots scoff at.\n\nSegment Three:\nMike\'s idea works better than expected.\n\"When in Rome...\" notes Gypsy.\n\nSegment Four:\nOutside the theater, Mike can\'t stop smiling (probably because he is a smiley face).  This angers Pearl, who promises to send something worse next time.\n\nThe unknown author of this MiSTing did a very good job converted the original game to the MST3K format, and several riffs will have you laughging out loud.  The addition of \"touch\" jokes, for when the player tries to interact with Mike &amp; the \'bots works especially well.  Overall, I have to say that this game does an excellent job, but doesn\'t seem to nail it quite as well as either Aceland or Despair (which I\'ll try to review as well.)  So, only four star since those two eventually surpased this hilarious game, but starting the ZZT MiSTing idea earns it another half star.',4.5,'2003-10-27','198.85.71.19\r',778),(703,'An original puzzler!','Amoden','blitzchops@turkishprison.com','It isn\'t every day that you find an original puzzle game.

Unlike boulder-xod, there are many types of boulders, some which aggravate me to no end. Which is the real killer of puzzle games: difficulty.\n\nBut, the author side-stepped difficulty and cussed at it. How so? The game operates on a pyramid.

Anyway, on to the Amazing Collasal Episode Guide format...\n\nThe Game:\nPrakash\'s \"Aceland\" is a fairly mediocre attempt at a ZZT game. It has a very basic \"save the kingdom from the evil tyrant\" plot, strung together with many boards suffering from \"i-gotta-fill-in-the-board\" syndrome. Basically , you must collect 5 keys, (note: actually objects, not really keys) four white and a yellow, to get to the tower of the evil mugerlock. The game actually holds together rather well, until the point in the game where your character gets the microwave weapon, essentially allowing you to kill every NPC in the game with only a touch or two. A gem generator in the bank makes money/health essentially unlimited, even if getting to it is supposed to be a secret. Also, the original version had a bug that prevented you from finishing the game, fixed for the purposes of this misting. And further still, the game has an annoying habit of holding your hand at times, removing almost all difficulty. Overall, Aceland is a dull, unoriginal ZZT game that the author must of thought was terribly witty. Unfortunately, it\'s mearly terrible.\n\nSegment One:\nJoel &amp; the \'bots discuss ZZT, and possibly making their own game. Crow suggests one set on the Satellite Of Love, and Joel tells him it\'s been done.\n\nInvention Exchange:\nJoel - Device for clearing a room full of monsters\nMads - Device which turns classic literature into bad ZZT games\n\nDr. F decides to try his invention on Shakespeare\'s Macbeth, and tells Joel it should be ready by the time the experiment is over.\n\nSegement Two &amp; Three:\nnone\n\nSegment Four:\nJoel does the classic \"tell me one good thing about Aceland, and i\'ll give you a RAM chip\" bit. Dr. F sends Joel the Macbeth game, and Joel deletes Tom\'s knowledge of Shakespeare for the time being. You then get to play through a rather silly dark board where you must murder the king. TV\'s Frank then recites a little from \"A Midsummer Night\'s Dream\", which the \'bots gleefully riff.\n\nStinger:\nhowa bouta soma ammonitino\n\nAlthough the second ZZT MiSTing leaves out Joel &amp; the \'bots in the corner of the screen like in \"Godzilla\", it is still my second favorite in the series. John W. Wells is our writer this time around, and he captures the characters prefectly. The riffers poke fun at the game\'s poor level design, ridiculous economic system (what with the infinte gems in the bank) and all points in between. The addition of the MST3K theme song overlayed on Aceland\'s original title screen is very nice.\nVery, very funny. allthough \"Despair\" is still the better MiSTing if you ask me, it\'s only by a small margin. I\'d give this game 4.75 stars if i could, but since a can\'t, i\'ll round it up to a 5 :)',0,'2003-10-27','138.253.235.68\r',24),(706,'Vs.

MAJOR POINTS\n\nSecondly, the game is actually prettier in this form.  zn knows how to make good ZZT graphics, pure and simple.\n\nThirdly, the text is ...far less minimalistic.  VERY FEW things ever gave out any text (which made the obvious totem-pole puzzle far more difficult).\n\nLastly, CAMEOS\n\nThe mechanics of the game remained pretty much the same.  There was one or two almost negligible omissions (like having to have a plunger as well as dynamite to set off the blast).

However once you actually start playing the game, the graphics disappear.\n\nBlood Oath carries a decent storyline where you play the apprentice of a necromancer who disappeared long ago in search of immortality. You can apparently attain immortality by drinking the blood of the BIG BAD wyrm. Before he left you both made a \"blood oath\" that if he never came back, you would go and try an kill the wyrm yourself. So off you go, into the cave.\n\nThe cave is a fairly large place. It\'s drawn simply, grey walls with a grey top to give it a little more of a 3-D feel. All in all though it is sparse on detail. Sure there are a lot of dead bodies, but most of them at just #Bind\'ed to another object and give you a message like: \"A skeleton with a crushed head.\"\n\nThere is little in the way of puzzles, but there are a few simple adventure style puzzles. The real meat of the game comes with the RPG battles. The battles are decent but nothing spectacular. They are randomised enough to give it less of a programmed feel, but in general, if you lose a battle, it\'s usually because you missed the health potion back a few screens. In this programmers opinion, without a level system or some sort of way to improve your characters, RPG battles are fairly pointless. Not being able to get past something because you are too weak is a key part of RPGs.\n\nThe author attempts some dark dramatic writting that sometimes works, and sometimes feels like a bad movie script. The only redeemable quality of the writing is the actuall story itself.\n\nThe graphics are on the weak side, excluding the nicely done opening cutscenes, and the gameplay is on the minimal side. Despite all of that it\'s still an enjoyable game with a decent story that won\'t take you too long to play. And even if you don\'t finish it, you won\'t quit the game pissed.',3.5,'2003-12-09','24.151.143.76\r',116),(774,'Sorry, but....','Homz','sherlock_homz@hotmail.com','Okay, that will be the last idiotic review of this simple game I\'m tolerating before I review it.\n\nThese fools who review games like idiot nebies, saying stupid things like \"LOL THIS GMAE Ro><oRS!!!!!111!!!\" practically. While I respect these people and Dr. Dos otherwise, it disturbs me to see these reviews go by unchecked from z2 authorities, in particular Mooseka\'s review, which is totally beside the point of the game. Mooseka\'s review is entirely erroneous and false. Quite to the contrary, this game is not the best ever, it\'s graphics are very minimal, and it is not a touching story about a boy dying from cancer.\n\nThis is a pre-fabricated arcade. The gameplay is not great, nor is the game of epic proportions. In this game you will find such obviously creative ideas as dodging stars for as long as possible, killing tigers as fast as possible while more spawn, and avoiding bears with only ten health. This is not a fountain of new ideas. For a few hours, it may be worthing wasting your time on, but eventually, you will find it wasting away on your hard drive in disuse. I also deeply noticed the extremely minimal and lacking title screen, a virtue that Dos seems to excel in. I would reccomend that you exercise a little more creativity in this area.

Unfourtunatlely the differance between Magic and Card Prime is that in Magic, reltively weak card still have use. In Card Prime, once you get the amazing super powerful cards, that\'s all you use. Sort of like the last battle in Chrono Trigger where all you do is use one triple tech over and over, use a mega-elixer, then rinse and repeat.\n\nThe concept is good, however the story to go with the concept is weak. It\'s obvious that it would be hard to give this game much more scope than it has, what with the KB limitations, but a more detailed background story, and perhaps a central character you can feel for, would help.\n\nAnother thing that removes enjoyment from the game is the graphics.

The minigames are very poor, consisting of little else than pre-fabricated enemies and other stuff typical of crap newbies like PKMN.

After a fun night of doing your job, you go to school the next morning, when WiL asks to speak with you for a moment before the bell rings, thereby enmeshing you in this bitter feud.\n\nThe graphics are superb, evoking just the right feelings to suit the occasion, be it the dim alley, Joey\'s sparse house, or the sky lit with fire. The music sets the mood perfectly with its beauty, and brooding sense of sorrow, and there is just enough music to fully round out and complement the game. The programming is always good, and at two places impressive, those being the battle engine, and leaving the house. The gameplay is what you would expect from interactive cinema, for the most part, except, perhaps, a little less interactiveness than some might desire, but, for the story, it suits perfectly. The story, of course, is what moves the game along, and is fittingly marvellous. It is just serious enough, yet still has those little touches of WiL absurdity, humour, and strangeness, yet these seem perfectly suited, somehow, fitting right in with every thing else, and a beautiful, if slightly inconclusive ending that is very moving.\n\nOverall, this is an almost flawless cinema, which every ZZTer should experience and treasure. Yes, it has its strange parts, but they seem to fit in with the usual seriousness of the story. As far as I understand, the story was based on a dream that WiL had, so this is fairly standard dreamish material, though perfectly suited to ZZT. It is indeed a necessary download, and one of the best of its genre.',4.5,'2003-12-18','66.38.200.194\r',1204),(807,'Not too great, but not the worst of the worst','Homz','sherlock_homz@hotmail.com','This game is, indeed, rather strange. It consists of several ?levels? strewn together, each consisting mainly of avoiding enemies or bullets as you only have ten health.\n\nStory: While the game could have at least had some form of story to explain what is going on, it doesn?t.\n\nGraphics: The graphics, while still rather poor, are a definite improvement over Minigame Collection, Sam?s first game, and are at least don?t hurt too much to look at, except for the invisible walls maze. For one, the maze consists of yellow walls, which are generally hated with a passion by ZZTers worldwide.

If you lock a game, it takes away one of your flags, pushing further limits on your game that would otherwise be unnessecary.\n\nThis and your other games could really use some work. Play some quality games, like ESP, Respite, anything by Zenith Nadir, and you?ll see what I mean. Take a look at the featured games and read the reviews, no matter how long they may be. Don?t just play them, study them. Look at what it is that makes them so great. Compare them with your games, and ask yourself how you can improve, but don?t expect to draw like Nadir right away. Quality work takes practice. If you don?t like how a particular board looks, redo it. It may take a little more time and effort, but if it earns you the recognition and respect of your fellow ZZTers, it is worth it. And most importantly of all, if you have any problems, register at the z2 forums and ask for help.

The insanity in this game isn?t even funny, just stupid. I gave Anarchy a chance, I was willing to tell myself that he had prospect, and just to expect he would use it. Wrong.

Here you\'ll have to fight with objects instead of creatures.\nThe bosses have to be fought differently than usual.\n\nPart 4: Final part, this part shows some points of imperfection. I found some bugs in the game. Objects who weren\'t locked, so if you touch them again, you\'d have to wait till it finishes again, and a few powerups that did\'t do anything. But like all other parts, very good graphics.\n\nDespite the bugs I still could finish this game, and I didn\'t regred downloading it.',3.5,'2003-12-19','217.121.120.236\r',92),(811,'Duky Inc makes me moist.','Commodore','jddgames@yahoo.com','There is so much going for this game.

Perhaps they both were.\n\nBattle Tech is a Duky Inc game from 1997. It\'s 4 files long, and take quite a while to play. One of the few games on the archive I hasten to call \"epic\". Much like its predecessor: Overflow.\n\nThe storytelling is nothing spectacular, but it has its moments. The real hook this game has is it\'s graphics and gameplay. The author has a distinct architectural mindset, and uses combines a strict use of symmetry with random spatterings of simple shapes and patterns to please the eye. Everything is in vivid colour and each board gives the eye something new to look at. There is a vast world to explore with lush forests, artic wastelands, mechanical nightmares, and everything in between. Hordes of monsters stand in your path and bosses fight you fiercely, many with their overwhelming visage looming overhead. The first two files are simple distractions from the plot, simply to test your mettle. The last two files alone could easily have been two seperate games.\n\nWhat\'s that you say? Don\'t fancy fighting prefab enemies? If you are not like me and don\'t really care for the classic ZZT enemies, you\'ll still be pulled onward to discover what lies beyond that next passage. What spectacle will you behold next? The destruction of a moon prehaps? The alien mastermind?

The gameplay seems too unbalanced however to make it thouroughly playable. The game is very faithful to Wolf-3d, the rooms, the secrets, the way the walls change in colours in different sections. The programming is flawless, the last boss astounding. However there are some distinct flaws that weaken the fun in this game. In the harder difficulties lack of ammunition becomes a factor fast, and considering there is little chance to avoid enemies, battles become impossible after you\'ve run out of bullets. Guards take far to many shots to bring down and don\'t garner enough ammunition to make up for it. A few badly placed shots could end it for you, not to mention that the amount of hits it takes to actually kill something leaves you to eventually try rapid fire, which ultimately leaves you wasting precious ammo on already dead bodies. The game is a bit short (However the size limitation was to blame) and only one boss.\n\nDespite that long rant about the flaws of the game, do not doubt the awesomeness of it.

I thought WiL was more popular than that. .\n\nVoyage Of Four is said to be an interactive movie (It is) but it is a lot more. There is a lot more interaction than what is made out to be. Many RPG battles and puzzles make this more of an adventure genre.\n\nPLOT: The setting is a mid-evil type land where populations live in small vilages. The culture therefore is primative in nature. Location is purely fiction.\n\nWell the plot was pretty simple at the beginning, but I was thoroughly confused towards the end. It begins with the story of a man who\'s village is destroyed and all the residents killed (Including his family). From his wife\'s last breath he learns that the army which wiped out his village is led by a mysterious \"Man in Red.\" The man then devotes his life for revenge.\n\nFurther in the story this man runs into three other \"heros,\" which is where \"The Voyage of Four\" comes from.\n\nThe end of the story became very confusing. It rambled on about a dark realm opposite of the regular world abd bringing balance between light and dark. It gave me horrifying memories of the Chronos Wars story line. Despite this written confusion, the ending DID make sense (At least the one I took. There are four, I believe).\n\nOverall the plot was quite good, despite a few weak spots in writing and a bit of confusion.\n\nGRAPHICS: You guys all know WiL, and you know what kind of job he does. The graphics for this game were marvelous and fit the story perfectly.\n\nMUSIC: Recently, ZZTers haven\'t been focusing much on the topic of music. They don\'t realize, however, how much it can add to the game. A good theme on a title screen can start the game off well, or perhaps a nice song during beginning narrations. WiL uses music to his advantage, giving the game a great feel. Not only is the music excellent, but it is exactly the right amount. He does not over-do it at all.\n\nPROGRAMMING: Voyage of four has two main types of programming; engines and cinematics.\n\nThis game IS an interactive cinema, so much of the programming is dialogue or movements. I did not notice any flaws in the cinematic programming. The other major part of the game includes various engines.\n\nWiL uses an original (I think) RPG engine which worked very well. The only thing I didn\'t think did much was the dodge option. Mabye I\'m wrong.\n\nAnother engine I really enjoyed tracked the player\'s party across a map. For each step the player took, random boulders would generate and turn into either breakables or fakes. Breakables acted as an obstacle, possibly forcing you to take a different direction. To make this engine feel like a Final Fantasy type RPG, enemies would randomly pop up on certain sqaures. When these were defeated, the player could resume his travel.\n\nOverall, the programming was very good. It even had a few \"tricks\" like diaganol movement.\n\nCOMPLETE BATTERY: This game is definitely one of the better games in the archive, and should be played by aspiring ZZTers. I really enjoyed it, and didn\'t get the feeling of \"When does this end?\" I would give it a five, but there were a few aspects that made me think otherwise.

Dispite that the story of NC is rather enganging. The character of Zanno is an interesting hero, a post office employee who blows the crap out of a co-worker/shoots random thugs in the streets, and gets drunk quite frequently. His only real goal is to survive.\n\nThe writing is a bit on the sloppy side, with some poor and easily predicted jokes, but there are some golden moments in this game. The courtroom scene is the most dragged out scene in the game and could very well have been eliminated or shortened significantly. I will not comment on the Communist.\n\nA lot of the gameplay is difficult and poorly concieved. The random shootouts with pirates/burglars/cops are frusterating. The game is sparce on health and ammo, you are only allowed to shoot one bullet at a time, and a lot of the action sequences are interupted by unneccesary spurts of plot or pointless narration. The gameplay is hit and miss. The shootouts can be fun, or tragically annoying. Being in a corridore with 8 guys shooting at you from behind a water barrier is not my idea of a fun shootout, and the programming that went into showing the other two characters dispatch their foes goes largely unnoticed by a player more interested in deducing how he\'s going to dodge the wall of incoming bullets. On the other hand the battle with one of the thugs is very difficult, but still is one of the more ingenious AIs I\'ve seen in ZZT shooters, and the battle with the space pirate captain is equally well programmed.\n\nThe random RPG battle was, well, random. Usually I don\'t like it when a game thrusts an RPG battle onto me unexpectedly (unless it\'s a game that has used many different engines all throughout), and I was a bit skeptical of the quality when reading the TXT file warning me of the impending event. I am not a fan of real time battles (Time gauge like in later Final Fantasies) but this one was a good one, the enemies used life bars, but not the breakable sort, and the main characters\' HP were actuall numbers, the action was fierce and quick paced.\n\nThere are some clever programming tricks used here, and the graphics (although composed of a lot of linewalls) are well done and abstract, much like the plot. The differences between the earth and neptune are great and add a very nice sense of atmosphere :)\n\nOverall, Nothing Constuctive is not a game to be avoided.

But the logo gives of a made-it-in-thirty-minutes retro ZZT feel. And the colours simply don?t match in the way they?re composed.\n\nAfter pressing the button to play, I?m forced to watch this painfully boring and, frankly, cheesy and unrealistic cop vs. bad guy shootout. At this point, I?m thinking ?I can see where this is going; I should?ve refrained from downloading when I saw ?Scorch3000? as the author?. The colours and contours on this first cinema board are on par with pre-stk low-fi productions. ?This is all horribly painful,? I?m thinking to myself.\n\n?Shall I go through the passage?? I think to myself. And then I decide to go through with it just to see what?s behind the door. And yes, you guessed right: it?s the same old story. The first playable board is horribly pre-stk retrospective. And what?s more he?s created these ugly strips of colour, horrible horrible pre-stk colour, that reminds me of some badly engineered Lego houses I saw at primary school.\n\nJust when I think it can?t get any worse, I am cracked over the head with a horribly retarded and inferior introductory statement. ?You wake up and look at the clock and hit it with a small hammer,? says the narrator. Jesus, what?s wrong with you, mister narrator guy, can?t you think of anything more amusing or witty to say? And why did he have a hammer right when he needed one? That?s simply uncanny.\n\nNow I walk over to the computer in this grotesquely inadequate, and not to mention, clich&eacute;d ZZT house. There?s a bed over in the corner. And Scorch has taken the time to describe the softness of the pillows. Breathtaking, I?m sure. And not to mention pioneering. Anyway, when I open the fake emails on the fake computer, I am introduced to one of the silliest and most retarded preliminary plot suppositions that could possibly exist. Some guy called Danny refers to the player as ?Agent Smith? and proceeds to inform you that a terrorist has escaped from the police and that he was once on their side; and that he was a GOOD agent. Never mind.\n\nI get all the usual newbie ?You must stop this evil megalomaniac from using stolen technology to create a time machine BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH? crap; and at this point I?m feeling so disgusted, that I want to kill myself.\n\nIt seems that quantity is more chief than quality in this game. There are tons of boards with no items or people, which use only two or three pre-stk colours. And while I?m traipsing around the land of boredom, I?m hoping I am not sucked in to it by some supernatural force, as it?s simply too dull. After I find the secret base, I decide to quit and view the game in the editor instead.\n\nEvery single board in this game looks horrible. There is little no stk. The sound is limited to annoying beeps when you press buttons etc. There is absolutely no atmosphere portrayed in either graphics or rhetorical imagery.

Having discussed it with him on several occasions and even played some of a preview I had been offered, Nexus III was, for me, one of the most anticipated games of the year.\n\nDid it live up to my expectations?\n\nNexus III continues to round off the evolution of My Liver Hurtz, from the rather horrible Nexus I, a decent but Spartan NII, on to the innovative yet deficient Z*Bert and Silicate. The My Liver Hurtz we see in this game is different, matured. He has studied his shortcomings and created something to be proud of.\n\nFrom the opening board of the space station to the outside shot of the K?Ton base, NIII has some graphics that are truly beautiful. Now, one must be mindful, MLH hasn?t attempted anything extremely ambitious, we are still left to our imaginations to what the K?Ton, or for that matter, our heroes look like, but what there is executed with skill.\n\nOf course, the emphasis in the Nexus games has never been the graphics, but the story, and, even more so in this installment, the gameplay, which consists of shootouts and engines, for the most part. The shootouts are very functional, excellently programmed, and are designed skillfully. Throughout the game, in fact, there are evidences of Liver?s great talent for programming, and, furthermore, the brilliance of his mind, in the innovation factor of the game. He employs several tricks and engines that may very well find you taking a peek at the source code.\n\nThe story continues from NII, seeing the three Admirals from the end of Nexus II coming to the grim conclusion that the K?Ton attacks they thought were random were, in fact, far from it. With the destruction of the Orbital Nexus Targeting system, they realize, they have lost the key to the Nexus, a gravitational phase frequency that opens the portal, discovered in a lab accident. And the fact that James Concade, the only man left who could have given it to them, was sent six months ago to destroy the powerful Tamara Missile and never returned, doesn?t brighten the prospect of survival. That is, before one of them reveals something. Concade?s ex-wife, Jennifer, knows the frequency. Preposterous, the others counter, even if she was alive, she would be 90 years old, and far from being in any condition to relay the frequency to them. Wrong, he replies, she is alive on Earth, a 32 year-old petty thief, being detained at the base. Jennifer, or Jade, as she is now known, is brought before them. After being asked for the frequency, she asks them where James is. They refuse to tell her, but finally break down. She agrees to tell them, but only on one condition. That they will send her to K?Ton, fully armed, in hopes that she may be able to find the man she left ten years ago. You portal in, in front of the prison facility suspected to hold James. None of the civilians surrounding you seem to notice, but the guards, now drawing their weapons, obviously do.\n\nOf course, Nexus is not without its flaws. Spelling mistakes are frequent, and occasionally, one feels that the story could just be a tad more polished, and even a bit longer, at times. The difficulty, often, is none too easy either. Though not quite at the level of something like Nothing Constructive, this is still a fairly hard game. I also found that, in my opinion, the end, which I will not go into detail on, seemed more than a little rushed. Where there could have been even a slight stir of the emotions, it drew a blank; merely raised an eyebrow before ?TO BE CONTINUED...? Furthermore, it seems, that for a rather dark story, a better atmosphere could have been conveyed, but, unfortunately, there is none.\n\nNevertheless, despite its flaws, Nexus: Future?s End has a lot going for it. It?s a fun game, and a breath of fresh air, when it seems ZZT is getting predictable. What?s more, to top it all off, NIII utilizes a rather fun idea: for replaying the game a second time around, you have the option to turn in-game commentary on. Of course, there\'s not a lot of it, but, it\'s still worth at the very least editing to gain some behind-the-scenes information.\n\nFiguring the flaws into the score, Nexus III gets a four, though, perhaps, had the flaws been corrected, it could easily have netted a 4.5, perhaps even higher.',4,'2004-02-24','66.38.200.149\r',1821),(898,'OMFG','Commodore','','Holy fucking shit this is terrible.\n\nFeaturing horrendous erotica, one poorly drawn topless woman, sex tips, fake letters ot \"DR BOB\", and the author\'s ratings of specific sexual positions, this \"game\" nearly made me cry in pain.\n\nThe story of a princess or some crap is terrible, third rate internet \"erotica\".

The step up from this would be the great and all powerfull Ninja monkey!\nSo the graphics were a 3 out of 5.\n\nGamePlay- The game is fun, (once you understand it that is), I thought, at first, that if you face a fire monster then its better to choose a \'water\' card. NOT TRUE, the only thing that will do will have the enemy have less attack power and YOU dont have as much ATK power as the enemy so thats not good. I suggest to use FIRE cards when up against FIRE monsters so you can get more hit out of your cards. Also its a good thing to have a nice healing card with you. Anyway, there were no buggs while I was playing in the battles but the \'main menu\' where you choose your next battle from that will mess up constantly. =( SAD FACE. So I award the gameplay a 4 out of 5.\n\nSound- I like the battle music (however it became a little annyoing after awhile. BUT can you guess where the last boss\' song came from? It came from Card Prime....the first one....yeah. Anyway, the sound was not \"WHOA COOL!\" but more like \"Cool\". So I give the sound a 3 out of 5.\n\nSo seeing these scores and to use complicated math equations out of your ability to figure out, I award CARD PRIME 2 a ....\n3.5\n\n\n',3.5,'2004-03-11','209.247.222.49\r',1831),(915,'Yeah...','Mr.Bob','','I played this game months ago and Im bored so Im going to do a review! YAY!\nOver all the game is kinda cool, I love the boat thing in the title screen. The music is well done, and the gameplay somewhat verys between worlds, (which is to be expected because everyone who made this game did their own speshul little part. ON TO ZA NUMBAS!\n\nGraphics- Very nice, and it keeps up the beat because it changes the styles of the graphics every time you change into another \'world/level\' whatever they called it. I did notice some slack in one level however I cant recall who\'s it was so I\'ll leave off of that.\nI give the graphics a 5 out of 5.\n\nSound- I dunno, Wells up there said it could be much better but I like it. I think the cold music durring the start is cool and snuff. I give the sound a 4.5 out of 5.\n\nStory- I\'ve never read the books that were used to make this games story but since it is not made entirly by them, right out of their imagination then I will take points off for that. But all in all the story is very good. I give the story a 3 out of 5.\n\nGameplay- Now this is where the lack was. I did not like the first level overall because it was boring and I forgot to save and I had to do it all over again! BLARG! That nadir place was just annoying. Jacobs thing was random and I thought it just did not fit the mood that the game\'s story tried to set up. Wil\'s was also annoying in a diffrent way. I belive I told that shy girl something wrong and that messed everything up and I had to start all over again! AUGH! I DONT LIKE THAT. But I did find it very interesting to say the least. With that said I give the gameplay a 2 out of 5.\n\nOverall the game seemed to be rushed at some parts...meh, thats what ya get.

It hurts you, and it hurts me too. But... it will be difficult.\n\nI hate ZZT Crime, and I hate most of Wong Chung Bang\'s games too. You know that bit near the end of the newest ChickenWire where I go off on one about how his \"retro-style\" ZZT games are actually just derivative rip-offs of someone else\'s creativity? Well, ZZT Crime isn\'t quite as retro, but the point remains that he\'s basically let someone else do the hard work, taken the best bits and used them for his own output. In fact, it\'s worse here than in those games, where he at least tried to put an original spin on Tim Sweeney\'s zillion-year-old puzzles.\n\nZZT Crime touts itself as an unofficial \"sequel\" to Barjesse\'s seminal ZZT Syndrome. This would be fine, if he were then to tackle problems not covered in the original file... but then the first seven boards repeat, almost word-for-word, EXACTLY what ZZT Syndrome advised; don\'t use yellow borders, don\'t use lots of monsters, don\'t use stars, etc, etc. Aside from being an obvious ripoff, it\'s also superfluous; yes, I realise that the game is geared towards amateur game designers, but even so it\'s not hard to tell them to just go download the original file, which is credited as \"inspiration\" on the title screen! Or maybe it\'s just a way to disguise your own dearth of ideas for the file? Surely not! I count that 18 of the game\'s 38 playable boards are dedicated to regurgitating Barjesse\'s advice. If it was just a little here and a little there I wouldn\'t mind, but good god man that\'s almost half the board total.\n\nThis continues throughout; the game tells you to give the player enough health and ammo, not to lock your games (albeit with a semi-nifty \"runtime error\" animation and a better explanation of why not to use Super Locks), not to use ping-pong paths, not to beg for money, blah blah blah. All been done before, far more eloquently.\n\nAnyway, enough bitching about unoriginal content. The game does have some original advice, such as the evils of item fields, how to #lock and #unlock objects properly, and an intensely irritating board where you are told by the author himself how stupid and terrible swearing is, that makes me want to fuckin\' smack him. These points are sound, I guess (apart from the latter, of course). Of course, these original points are interspersed with Barjesse\'s stuff, which as a veteran ZZTer I just find distracting, although if you\'re a newbie who doesn\'t know any better you won\'t mind. Saying that\'s okay, however, is like saying it\'s okay for children to watch terrible low-quality cartoons; while it won\'t actually harm them, they won\'t thank you later.\n\nIronically, the game suffers from a crime itself which is not mentioned throughout; linking the wrong board through a passage! It also veers dangerously close to another crime not mentioned; PLAGIARISM. Yes, I\'m really hung up on this. \"You vs. Stupidity 2\" is a far better guide on this matter, and that\'s not even a tutorial, it\'s a game where you kill Blue\'s Clues.\n\nOn the plus side, it\'s cool to be able to type \"zzt crime\" in the DOS prompt to load the game up, and the graphics are okay (he actually uses STK this time around, thank god). Other than that, don\'t bother with this; get ZZT Syndrome and ZZT Pro (by Kjorteo, it\'s good even though I vehemently disagree with his stance on dark rooms) instead. You deserve better ZZT tutorials than this derivative rehash of someone else\'s ideas.\n\nHarsh, aren\'t I?',1.5,'2007-06-06','83.10.242.3\r',228),(918,'OK, A perfect score for this game?

Smiley Guy was one of the winners of a game contest that Epic Megagames sponsored to generate interest in ZZT.  I deliberately left off the password protection.  So, it\'s great to see what Zenith did to improve the graphics.  In fact, I had a graphically improved version of Smiley that I submitted, but it was too late to make Epic\'s publication.  By the way, I no longer live at the address that you find early in the game.\nSmiley received fan mail. Yeah, fan mail!  Tim Sweeney at Epic told me that Smiley might have been the most popular of the contest entries.  So, I sent him a sequel, Toxic Terminator.  At first, Tim rejected it, because he was moving to 256-color graphics with Jill of the Jungle, which I got to test while in prototype.  Later, he called me and said his office got hooked on Toxic.

It plays much like lemmings except you only control the one and there is no mouse cursor. Zem walks back and forth in a straight path until you tell him either to build a stair, bash through a rock, or other lemming type things. The controls are a little weird to get used to, what with looking at the side bar to make sure you\'re going to the the right thing before falling off a cliff, and it gets a little frusterating in a few tight spaces where you don\'t have a lot of time to act.

But I think it would be wise to say that there is a certain majesty that goes beyond the limitations, and the art itself is vivid, and iridescent with pioneering concepts. All the animals drawn are complete with hideous or beautiful appearances. Some of them have wicked looking faces complete teeth and grimaces. The use of STK is the best I have ever seen in this ZZT file; the colours are blended and arranged in comical images for the best possible ZZT art.\n\nUnfortunately they let Peter Saltfleet (Nadir) do the narrative and preamble. His barely conscious and unfunny rhetoric is utterly painful to read. But since this is an art collection, the bad writing skills are irrelevant; so I am awarding five stars.',5,'2004-04-24','195.92.67.79\r',1845),(955,'Go back and DO IT AGAIN','medieval','medieval@fairytooth.co.uk','The title ?Flower of Light? will be considered ?cheesy? by many, but insofar as the motive behind it can be discerned, I don?t really have a problem with this name. The game itself is quit boring. You must go to ?Fairyland? and find a flower that will cure the blindness of your king. Yawn.\n\nAlthough the plot preamble is charming, it is unfortunately debased with the impurities of nonsense. It seems that the author had a fairly good idea for the plot, but rushed its conception. And ultimately the viewer is left confused as to whether it deserves full acclaim.\n\nWhen I finished the game, I was left somewhat disappointed because it seems that the author put a lot of effort into the atmosphere of the game, but rushed the narrative and plot elements. I enjoy games that can offer a unique atmosphere; like the wistful feelings of decay in DPLobster?s ?Daymare?, the cold and breezy evocation of Herc?s ?A Community X-mas?, and the seriously retro-eighties feel of Well?s ?ESP?. But these outstanding atmospheres require a firm plot-base to uphold them; and it is vital that the author of a game has good literary skills. Unfortunately this requirement wasn?t met in ?Flower of Light?.\n\nThe graphics in ?Flower of Light? don?t remain at the original level of superiority. By the time you get halfway through the game, the boards appear rushed at best. The puzzles in the game are far too easy to solve. Does anyone remember those puzzles in ?Town of ZZT?? Now that?s what I want to see in these modern ZZT games.\n\nGameplay wasn?t very appreciable. You would expect uniqueness in monsters in a modern ZZT game, not prefab enemies. And you get given too much health and ammo. The rpg battles are just copied from the original pioneering battles of other games. The author of this game hasn?t done anything to make them original, or even challenging. Boring.\n\nThe ending in this game is awful, and it was so quick too. A quick ?You bring teh magik flower to da king and cure his eyes and stuff and the princess is saved and stuff. The End?. Sigh. I wanted something that would bring a tear to my eye. And you would expect that from a game with a title like ?Flower of Light?, wouldn?t you? Yes, you would.\n\n(My new method of awarding stars is to divide the maximum possible 5 stars between the five major aspects of a game. Action, Atmosphere, Graphics, Originality, and Plot. I will award a complete star if the aspect shows to be pioneering in some way, half a star if it is merely passable, and otherwise no star will be awarded.

There was no background information; all I knew was that my best friend died.  As far as I can gather, the game centers around a war between two rival street gangs, the Green Dragons and the Red Dragons.  Of course, I can\'t really say for sure -- that was all inferred from the dialogue.\n\nWhile there are some very good games that don\'t reveal much of the storyline at the beginning (i.e. Code Red) this one doesn\'t really give the player enough time to figure everything out -- I think I beat this in under three minutes.

The second game by Wong Chung Bang in this style, this game is addictive and fun and very reminicient of the games he is trying to emulate.\n\nJust as in Town and the rest, your mission is to find 5 purple keys to escape from the Pyramid. A liberal spattering of well designed puzzles, and combination of preprogramed and object enemies makes this a worthy addition to the ZZT saga. WCB\'s first game of this type, Tower of ZZT, was not as well designed as this one. The former was formulaic and required no exploration, which did not capture the feel of the original games. Pyramid on the otherhand, is exceedingly better, with a large area to explore, non-linear gameplay, and puzzles that are fun and (to an extent) original.\n\nThe game comes with two files. The first is the game with it\'s original graphics. The second is revamped with STK. Even in the non-STK version the game graphically exceedes the originals, with a stronger emphasis on fades and symmetry. You\'re not going to find cutscenes or graphics that pretend to be three dimensional, but that was never the point, and the lack there of does not hurt the mission of the game. Indeed, the simplisic graphics are less taxing on the eyes as the disjointed colour fest that was The City of ZZT. WCB\'s decision to abandon the excessive line wall aspect of the originals is much appreciated.\n\nThe writing, what little there is, is the only distracting part. As you collect keys, you get mystical engouraging messages, and some are really cheesy. Again, the intent of this game is not to stun you with a gripping story, the intent is the suck your brain out through your eyes with addictive gameplay, something this game is full of...\n\nbut not too much...\n\nPyramid of ZZT is considerably shorter than its 1991 bretheren, falling short of the Caves of ZZT by about 23 boards. Pyramid has a total of 16. Still this is understandable with what one has to work with, the format WCB is using is old, and fresh ideas can easily run out fast.\n\nDo you enjoy playing the original ZZT games?

This is not a zzt game but a collection of art boards done by two people who left ZZT years ago. Nadir gatherd the art and added a few little knickknacks here and there. Besides alot of art boards this \'game\' has a few long speeches by Nadir, and a demo of sorts of a game called, \"THE PIT\".\nNow, Ownage Triangle has really no gameplay in it besides looking at art, but thankfully that is where the game excels the most in. It will show you PURTY art, possibly the best that art can get in ZZT. Besides having almost no gameplay there is no music. (That I can remember). So, this is basically a short art museum tour. Not that its a bad art museum tour but lets say that the trip is TO short.\n\nGamplay-(I\'ll base this on \"THE PIT\")\nLets face it. Art Boards get boring. They get boring FAST. So it really is a nice addition to Ownage Triangle to have a nice little dungeon hack.

Appliance\'s games over the years have almost always varied by Genre. This is his first Platformer to hit this site. Pandemonium Alpha is a solid platformer with some puzzels, somewhat annoying enemies that can jump from the floor to the ceiling, varying bosses, and a dissappointing story. The gameplay however is very well done but sometimes can be plain annoying.\n\nGameplay- The gameplay is solid, and the enemies give you a hard time to get by. Sure the blind ninjas that can jump from the floor to the ceiling are kinda easy, the metal turrents are put in the most annoying places EVER, (Even in the first level). There a 5 parts of a level you have to go through, the fith part is always a boss. The bosses are very well done in programming, but in art style they somewhat look bland. Alot of the bosses, however, dont really need that much detail in art. How you beat them is the same, look for the weak point and fire away. (One boss, The Metal Spider, you cant kill with bullets, you have to find a different approach.) Few last things, you have unlimited ammo, there is a grappling hook, (COOLNESS), and like in the Megaman games there are spikes that kill you by just touching them. =( HULK SMASH. All in all, the gameplay is pure and has just enough variety to get you through the game. 4.5 out of 5\n\nSound- The music is perfect. One can\'t say no to Level 5\'s music. In the game the cut scenes have music that propel the mood of the game onward. Appliance also put in music while you play the levels in the game. At first this sounds cool, but it gets VERY annoying after one or two minutes. The music is varried and can be very engaging and mood altering. (such as the fourth level where there is some light stealth action involved.) Together these pices of music are very well done but get annoying once you\'ve heard them for awhile. 4.5 out of 5.\n\nGraphics- The graphics in the gameplay certainly lack flair, but you would think the cut scenes would make up for it. They dont. But the graphics do add to the \'look\' of the game so you really cant complain that much.\n3 out of 5.\n\nStory- It gives you some insight into the dark history of this small galaxy. There defiantly should be some more background into the diffrent \'worlds\' that reside in this game. But sadly the only two plantes you know is the \'good\' planet, and the \'bad\' planet. (Lucindea and Drakor, however you spell them.)The story tells a tale of a young girl who saved her planet from impending doom and was cryogenicly frozen to keep her for the next time she was needed. Fenx, (her new partner), is somewhat of a perv and loves Rina. Rina, on the other hand, would kill Fenx faster than you can say, \"Cheesy-pun-pinker-nickle\", if she did not need him to pilot her to her different mission areas. The game has great character development but the lack on other things really leave more to be disired. 3 out of 5.\n\nFunfactor- Some fun is to be had. Be it the perverted jokes of Fenx, or the feeling you get once you\'ve taken down an entire space fleet and sniped out one of the generals of the opposing army. 3.5 out of 5.\n\nOverall- A nice game for when you have some free time. Im looking forward to  Pandemonium Invasion. =)\n3.5 out of 5',3.5,'2004-05-15','209.214.201.200\r',1850),(979,'You know you play too much Final Fantasy when...*p','dapper gent','yotsua@aol.com','If you don\'t know how this works, check the Super Metroid boards.\n\nI\'ll start with: You walk around the desert with a rock looking for a flying boat.

Does it fare as well as their grilled cheese sandwich maker? Well...\n\nSTORYLINE:\n\nThe storyline (which is what counts most in a sound novel) is very juvenile: you take the role of Lyle the Panda, who lives with his owner, a little boy named Jeffy Bone on Neat Street. Everything is fine and dandy, until one evening, you hear the incessant ringing of a telephone from the front yard. You venture out of your pandahouse. The next thing you know, you\'re in the back of a van and you\'re heading for the pound!! Why? That\'s what YOU have to figure out!\n\nAlthough the story is aimed at younger audiences, there are a few jokes and examples of social satire that us adults will chuckle knowingly to ourselves at. My favourite of these is a scene involving club politics in the secret barroom in the back of the pound, which I won\'t spoil for you, but let me tell you, it\'s a real hoot. Anybody who can read will enjoy this game. Unfortunately, the majority of the public do not have this skill, so this gets points off.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nI\'m very pleased with what characte designers Alcazar Geddy did with this: No anthromorphic \"furs\", that you\'d see in most of today\'s games, movies or political rallies; Geddy stuck with making each animal look like a real animal. The rabbits? They\'re no bigger than the size of your hand, and they look at you blankly, or in slight confusion, like a real rabbit would. The birds? You don\'t see the birds up-close-and-personal, because, like real birds, they fly away in a panic when you approach! Bravo, Geddy! Bravo!\n\nThe backgrounds can be a bit bland at times, but some scenes shine like no other. My favourite backgrounds are Neat Street, the secret barroom, the weight-lifting yard, and the spooky and atmospheric basement of the pound.\n\nSOUND:\n\nGoodwich Appliances must have pulled some major strings somewhere, because they got K(yrgyzstan)-Pop idol Naryn Baryn-chan to sing the opening theme, \"Vinny Viddy Volvo\". The song shines through the mud like headlights on a struck-down five-year-old girl. It even prompted me to buy a Naryn Baryn-chan album (\"Sixty Fathers With No Way Home\", if you\'re wondering, and it\'s superb).\n\nThe rest of the music, however, is standard Casio demo music. Not bad, but nothing mind blowing.\n\nAESTHETICS:\n\nMost sound novels have the same aesthetics; look, investigate, talk, move, use item, etc. And for this, Panda-Monium does its job well. There\'s a minigame near the end: a cowboy style quickdraw shootout with---oh, I can\'t spoil it! The controls in this minigame are responsive, and accurate. The guns miss every time, and occasionally jam and explode in your hand (paw?). I\'m LOVING it.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nUnsurprisingly, Panda-Monium hasn\'t brought anything new to the table. Surprisingly, it\'s a fun little game from a kitchenware manufacturer! The heartwarming tale and slightly lewd humour kept me hooked to the end, and I\'m sure it\'ll do the same to you.\n\nSo, to Panda-Monium: Alphabits, and to Goodwich Appliances, I raise my glass.

Also one thing that should be know by anyone programming an enemy is that you can\'t shoot it when it\'s touching you, which makes the stair case scene a little annoying. There are artboards and cutscenes here, which help drive the plot. And there\'s a little more freedom. It\'s not difficult at all, you start with about 4000 health and 32000 bullets, making the shops and vending machines you encounter pointless.\n\nFOr SKC Soft I\'d suggest learning to program enemies better, using perpendicular movement, random movement, and learning when to use \"?\" instead of \"/\". There are times when the enemies get hung up in their flailing deaths.

It\'s nothing spectacular, just your standard invisible fades in a small 8 by 10 box in the corner of the screen.  Boring.  If you have nothing better to do with your time, you can even go into the editor and put your own music into one of the 4 \"user slots\" which are empty objects... then you can go into WISH and listen to it whenever you like!!!  Gone are the primitive times when you would be forced to rely on a rudimentary ZZT board that you must create yourself using a couple of buttons... you would actually have to use this method to store your music!!  Thank Zeus, wish is released and now we can go through an unneccessary loading process and store our music creations in up to 4 \"user slots.\"  If this doesn\'t feel cheap enough to you, the ZZT music creator thing from the encyclopedia has been stolen and placed in here as a \"music editor\" for your convenience... rejoice...\n\nNext we come to \"Project Pro\" which is a complete waste of time.  Honestly.  There is a .txt document reader which is a waste of time if you have access to a program such as Notepad, there\'s the graphics creator straight out of the Encyclopedia, and a \"Spreadsheet Creator\" which allows you to put a bunch of colored solids on a grid.  Nothing to see here...\n\nWe come to \"Games\" next and here is where I was hoping to be impressed.  (HAHAHA YEAH RIGHT)  We have Wish Invaders up first, which is truly awful and has very little in common with Space Invaders, a far superior game.  Wish Demonz is directly stolen from some other game where you walk around a \"3d\" labyrinth and fight pre-programmed monsters at random... however, it doesn\'t matter because you come in through a blocked passage, so selecting this will force you to restart the program.  Then we have the breakout game which I have definitely seen somewhere else, it\'s stolen and seems to be buggy.  The creator also thoughtfully included a section for \"other games\" where you, the user, can send him some games you want to see in future WISH releases.. *chokes on vomit*  No, seriously, he wants you to send him some games to put in the next version!  To quote:  \"If I approve of it (fun or not), then I will put it in Wish.\"  Fun or not!!  This attitude shown by the programmer clearly shows us why this so-called operating system fails to deliver.  So-called \"fun\" is not one of his priorities.  Having reached this shocking conclusion, I cannot in good conscience continue to review this abomination.\n\nDr. Dos WAS being very kind with his 2/5.

It is an action/strategy game hybrid with influences from eastern philosophy, Ikaruga, and of course, ADOM.\n\nIn an alternate plane where every being, except of course karmics such as yourself, has an aura of either blue, green, or red, imbalance has occurred and the aurae are struggling against one another. You\'re out to change all that, even if it means destroying everything in the universe. Dr. Dos refers to these as the \'extinction\' endings, comprising three of seven possible conclusions to the game (not counting death), one of the games\' most recommending features.\n\nOr perhaps you\'d just like to have one aura dominate, and then face the boss of that particular aura and lay down some good ol\' fashioned karmic whoop-ass, using your unique ability to change aurae to meet that of your opponents. And you\'re going to be doing that a lot.\n\nSo you run around changing your aura as you meet your opponents. It sounds simple enough, but the levels ascend in difficulty reasonably evenly, and there are one or two that took me four or five save/die/restore attempts to complete. Others are a cakewalk, however. The enemies vary in strength and intelligence, while each aura maintains its own distinct characteristics (red creatures won\'t even move toward you much if at all, but they hurt a lot if you do contact them - but the blue ones are the true nasties).\n\nOne problem with the game is that at points it can get tedious. I would have been interested had Dos included some slightly less action-oriented puzzles - buttons that change the aura of opponents, or open gates, or using objects, or similar linear puzzles, in the vein of the development that craNKGod introduced into *Little Square Things*. That would have been neat. Some music or sound for the game would also have been nice (said MadTom, who was asked to do just that).\n\nGraphics are one of Dos\' self-confessed weaknesses, but what the game lacks in an aesthetic sense is made up for in reasonably in-depth level design and a somewhat addictive, though appropriately simple, premise. I can\'t, for reasons obvious, comment on the title screen and menu.\n\n*Aura* is not an easy game. You are not going to beat it, regardless of your choice of ending, without saving/dying/restoring at least a few times. There are several tricks and traps, some obvious and predictable, others quite nasty. You are likely to learn a few strategies ... which aura is best for the very first steps of each level?\n\nThe Ultimate Karmic God ending in particular is reasonably (but not incredibly) difficult to get. The only advice I will offer you is to have a good stockpile of health. Actually, that applies to just about every level of the game ... good thing health bonuses are reasonably abundant.\n\nAll in all, the game is one of the best uploads to the site this year, appropriately also being the very last one uploaded. Dr. Dos\' skill as a ZZTer puts him easily within the range of Quantum P., Commodore, and other present-day whizkids of the ZZTing scene, and I\'m very much looking forward to his next release.\n\nGood job, Dos!',5,'2005-01-20','220.236.163.144',1889),(1029,'hi','nuero','nuarrow@gmail.com','this is the best thing ever\na++ would buy from again',5,'2004-07-14','172.144.211.208\r',10),(1030,'A leap forward in ZZT gaming!','dave2','dragopublish@hotmail.com','With it\'s astonishing 14 lines of code, 3D talk engine breaks the fourth wall in ZZT, nay, worldwide gaming history.  Put aside for a minute the fact that the board you play on only takes up 2.7KB out of the 49KB within the zip file (28KB of that is a .doc file with a total of six lines, one of which is \"Finally! After all these years! I?ve reaserched how to make characters that talk in 3d!\"  Another 14.5KB of that is toolkits which were not made by Mew).\n\nNobody ever said that a game needed to exceed 3KB to be a success (although it is a requirement of Z2).  Nobody said that a game needed to let you move the player more than one time, either.  That\'s right, you move the player in this game a total of one time, but what an exhilarating one time it is.\n\nDidn\'t I mention the graphics this game possesses?  There\'s a fine looking chap with a red shirt and blue pants on, and for some reason his arm is made up of objects.  Why?  To up the filesize, no doubt.  To the right of the already excellent main feature is a road drawn with the word \"amusment\" beside it.  I am most certainly amused!  It doesn\'t matter that it makes no sense for a vertical road to be going up into the sky in the middle of a black void.  It\'s obviously amusing enough to stand alone.  It also doesn\'t matter that Mew misspelled \"amusement\" because this game rocks, and that\'s all that matters.  I\'m not going to be a grammer Nazi here, folks.\n\n\"Finally! After all these years! I?ve reaserched how to make characters that talk in 3d!\" - Mew\n\nOn to the main feature of the game.  The 3D talking.  Don\'t know what it means to talk in 3D?  Play this game to find out.  Granted, it\'s not a perfect example of 3D talking, but for a ZZT emulation of it, it\'s about as close as one could ever wish to get!\n\n\"it was truly the zzt-oop triumph of the decade\" - Nitr0 (Aka Stiltzkin)\n\nAfter moving one time you are allowed, you can then touch an object which makes a white object (the character\'s mouth) turn into #char 255 twice.  The game also makes two beeps, as the word \"Hello\" spouts from the mouth of the square headed character on the left side of the screen.\n\nThis is nothing but pure brilliance.  It will forever change the way cinemas are made.  I don\'t know a single ZZTer who hasn\'t made use of the 3D Talk Engine.

He is a sentient doctor\'s bag who is planning to turn the Nipple world into his kingdom of monsters and devils. You come to know Camera J in your adventure, and other guys\' help, you are able to recover your Nippleanus power and partial memory of your past.

There are some very useful things here, ones that exploit the form of SZZT. I was particually impressed with the credits engine, which while simple, is very effective. The side scroller equally so, and with SZZT, it can actually be called a side scroller.\n\nIt\'s very informative on the use of the Z flag, and tells how to make clever use of the Hint command. It also details a new message in SZZT :enter, which is sent when the player enters the board for the first time. On these cases, the encylopedia is very useful.\n\nOther such idea such as same board passages, are already common knowledge, but certainly help the beginner. The descriptions of some of the new features and monsters in SZZT is very sparce and not too informative. But then again, less is known about the game than ZZT.\n\nStill it\'s not very complete (as stated in the txt and file) and many things are horrible useless, such as the 3d engine which looks 10 times worse in szzt than it does in zzt.\n\nDispite these flaws, The SZZT encylopdiea is useful.

I wonder if the game live to it\'s expectations and worth a chunk of change it toke to get it.

With ribald humor, and at lease 30 missions and bunch of minigames to add to your toosie pop layers.  If that make your mouth water then start licking!!\nFeature/Elements-As you start the game, you go around talking to contacts, or other fellas and get missions that can range from trying to find point b then go back to point a, to going inside building and cars and do whatever it needed to complete the mission.  While some seems repetitive, some do get you to do a little hand labor, and you got a niffty map \"poster\" and the tube stations to help out on your travels (not too much I\'m afraid as one you needed to use the most is only two boards apart).  Some parts I do wish it tells you you\'re finish with the job, and give you a gist of what to do.  I guess with commodore the only playtester, not to many things you could spot for improvement.\nAnother feature is that you can buy building which can open up a minigame and a special mission.  And you got one place that generates cash if you just hang around there(a bit pointless to me).\nI can\'t say I haven\'t played the minigame at the arcade once before in MasterRaze previous games, but for those who didn\'t, they\'re here.\nThen there is this Sniping Mission created by \"amiga\", heheh.  The unsteady nerve is a stroke of genius, but the engine is evilly flawed.  How?!  If you haven\'t use sights before in shooters, it won\'t be no problem, but for those who do, like mwa, then you know that the controls should be reversed (which ends up when you move left, the guy and desk runs off in the corresponding direction, which sounds retarded, and it is).  Alas, one can\'t think of everything.\nSpeed-Pysically okey.  It\'s how you go about in the game.  Either you go and complete all the job the game has to offer or you just complete the story missions.\n\n_Atmosphere_\nVisual-*Gasp*No trademarked dark grey walls and building?!  Yay...no wait, spoke too soon.  Naul, really it pretty desent and are above AVERAGE.

Each board you start on is a timed level you must complete, most you simply go to the exit trying not to get zapped back to start(losing a life), while other yields a simple engine.  Then after a certain amount of levels, you face a boss.  Sounds kinda so-so, and basic, but I know this can be something.  What exactly.\nFeatures-Mind all the BICs you see throughout the game, there are few objects here and there if you notice them, like the boulder you have to out run(best using the mouse if yours work), and the bosses.  The levels are a little spaced, and straight foreward, leaving you a little option to just shoot a bunch of BICs and gather keys to get to the exit, leaving only some proving to be challenging.  The biggest killer is, get this, a star machine.  The Ultimate Machine at the end that will pumble you with stars.  It yells utter stupidity.  I can get \"only a few stars at a time\" that you\'ll be able to defeat it with minimal damage, but shilloads!?!  Now if the levels have a little more objectives to do before exiting, and that damned machine is demasculated, it\'ll be a tight game.\nSpeed-It flows right to the action, like what ARCADE genra should be.\n\n_Atmosphere_\nVisual-The game doesn\'t stress on the graphics much (a lot of solid fills), only the environment changes in colour as you progress thought the levels.\nSound/Music-N/A Not enough to be notice.\nImagetry-\"As you walk into the room, you hear the voice of the man in the lower-right corner of the screen.\"  Well, he suceeded in making coke spew out my nose.\n\n_Story_\nIn this game, you\'re a worker and some jackass desided to sabotage the mines.

Though this is not the only thing you do.  You, of course, will have to solve a little puzzle here and there, and may have to backtrack to solve previous ones.  This game has all kinds of different types of robots, security systems, and dangers, so it won\'t get too tiring.  I went through the game just to find challenges, and non\'of\'em didn\'t disappoint me.  Some object programming uses the \"smack check\" pretty well,...well, exept the buzzsaws.

Rob Liefeld, for those who don\'t know, was, if not the key proponent of it, certainly a major element of the style-over-substance, kewl, X-tryme, \"which superhero will die in this issue\", exaggerated anatomy, 100 bad rip-offs of Wolverine/Lobo, gun-toting \'bad girl\' garbage that most people think of when they consider the comic collector/speculator boom and bust of the 90\'s. Although this parallel is most evident in his game \'N-E-O\' (in which every character seems to be a testosterone-sweating, hulking great caricature of the Liefeld creation Cable), Final Fantasy Disc 1 still has a lot to say for itself. Let\'s see.\n\nGraphics; While it\'s true that Chase can draw pretty well, he then goes and wastes this talent by using a technique that could generously be described as \'diffuse\'; objects may be well drawn, it\'s just that you can\'t work out what the hell they are. The houses in the first village look like month-old horse turds with windows installed, and the floor texture in the castle looks like everything\'s been chewed up by a puppy yet to be housebroken. There\'s a lot to be said for simplicity, especially in something as graphically primitive as ANSI.\n\nIn other words, top marks for style, minimum marks for technique. Just like Liefeld (but replace \'diffuse\' with \'tiny ankles and swiss-cheese necks\')!!!!!!!!!\n\nStory; As has been discussed in depth by people who have actually played the damn game, this is a huge rip-off from Suikoden. As if stealing the name from a famous gaming franchise wasn\'t enough! I don\'t know much about Suikoden so I won\'t say anything else about that, though it goes without saying that Liefeld stole a lot of character designs from Marvel and DC during his tenure in Image (most notably Supreme, which Alan Moore later changed from a moronic, violent comic into something pretty awesome, but that\'s irrelevant).\n\nProgramming; Oh hell, I can\'t really make any comparisons between Chase and Liefeld in this catagory, can I? Well, I\'ll just say the programming is shoddy and leave it at that, shall I? I suppose that\'s excusable since the game is blatantly unfinished, but there\'s no excuse for the dialogue. I\'m no writer myself, but I could crap out better dialogue than this \"casual\" scene\'s;\n\n--\nIt is Devin Liukan, your childhood\nfriend, you haven\'t seen in years.\nHe rushes up to greet you. You both\nembrace.\n\nDevin: \"Surprise, dear friend!\"\n\nYou: \"What brings you to Stonegate?\"\n\nDevin: \"I was in town on business, and\nI heard of your acquisition by the king.\n-I have come to congratulate you..\"\n\nYou: \"My friend, .. how long has it been?\"\n\nDevin: \"Three years I believe..\"\n\nYou: \"You still studying to be a thief?\"\n\nDevin: \"Still studying?! Hell I\'m the teacher now!\"\n\nYou both laugh.\n--\n\nThat is the funniest joke in the game. See what he did there?! As can be inferred from the dialogue, all the characters talk the same and there\'s really no characterisation; Devin is The Friend who accompanies you on your quest, Cleo is Your Sister (who annoyingly says \"Father\" or \"Brother\" at the end of seemingly every sentence she speaks), your Father is Stern, etc. These are archetypes, not personalities, which would be fine if there was at least an attempt at some sort of development; but it never comes.\n\nAs an aside, an odd quirk of Chase\'s that I\'ve noticed on editing his work is how his commands all seem to have something to do with excrement; \':poop\', \':shit\', \':crap\', etc. It\'s nothing significant, I\'m just mentioning it as yet another possible parallel to Liefeld\'s propensity have his characters say \'shit\' frequently. However, there are not enough references to blood in the code for this to be a major point (Bloodlines has \'blood\' in the title though, I suppose that counts).\n\n-\n\nAnd it\'s awesome that Chase has only ever finished one project (ie. Bloodlines; I suppose I\'ve no room to talk, I\'ve not touched any aspect of Frost, in ZZT or otherwise, for months), again just like Rob Liefeld!! Holy shit, it\'s like they\'re the same person! I\'m surprised Chase never tried to release his ZZT games with multiple title screens (one of which would, of course, be somehow covered in some kind of holofoil crap)!\n\nOf course, taking the parallel to its conclusion, Final Fantasy Disc 1 has become the butt of a lot of jokes, just like Youngblood did. Ha ha.\n\nIn conclusion, stop giving this game good reviews, you idiots. If you can\'t live without a good fantasy ZZT game, go play a good game like Ned the Knight; the graphics may not be as kewl and extreme as FFD1, but it\'s got soul, which is an element absent from 90% of Chase\'s output.\n\n0/5. I\'d give it 0.5/5 but I feel a deep and abiding need to lower the score some more from those positive reviews.\n\n-zn\n\nps. i sure do hope chase reads this and calls me a grade-schooler! it would be the highest honour ^___^',0,'2005-03-13','138.253.161.186\r',1611),(1154,'...

It featured music by Kevin Carter, aka Kev-san, who was a 13 year-old musical prodigy. It was also announced during a brief high in \"Classy, deep, meaningful\" ZZT games spearheaded by Anthony Testa, aka Shigesato, who would later provide the kick-ass graphics to Freedom. The main selling point was the fact that it was a Rock Opera done on ZZT with music by Kev-san. On paper, it looked like a hit.\n\nBut... let me give some history here\nI was good friends with Kev, so I could tell you that Freedom was mulling over in his head for a very long time. However, Kev is, IMHO, a better composer than writer, and it shows. Many ideas were basically lifted straight from the classic novel The Giver along with little drops of the darker 1984 - Small community, protagonist with some sort of undefined specialness, evil government and an overall sense of oppression with a tender love story attached. Okay, sure. Not very creative, but I\'m sure that part of Kev\'s reasoning to make Freedom a musical was because you can get away with unoriginality in a musical so long as your music is good.\n\nUhh...almost.\n\nNow, despite some of these other reviews, some of the music is pretty kickass. There used to be a CD Kev had which contained all the music using synthesized instruments and I can tell you from what little I heard, the music kicked ass before being butchered into this.\n\nIn detail -\n\n1) Overture - YES! YES! This is great...the intro with our protagonist falling and this wonderful music going at insanely fast speeds.   It\'s fast-paced and epic, yet dark. This is Kev at his finest, where the PC speaker sounds like an actual instrument.\n\nWar - Uhh..no. Total 180 from the beginning. Seems to be going for a jazzy feel at first, but then it just devolves into some tuneless mess with some drum work that doesn\'t sound half as good as it should. The lyrics are also kinda bleh.\n\nDecision - The evilll elders are meeting. Great, simple yet stylish graphics are present here with a pretty decent sound. The lyrics aren\'t too bad either and there is a fuckin\' awesome \'solo\' in the middle which again shows why Kev was so sought after for projects. Fairly good.\n\n(I forget the rest of the titles here so..)\n\nBirth - Yeah, our hero is born to some mediocre writing and composition which, while adequate, didn\'t translate into ZZT very well. I\'m sure Kev meant this to have lots of symbolism with stuff like \"wrapped in fleece,\" but it all falls flat. The art is not that great either.\n\nMicah\'s Angsting - Okay, so our hero was put into a home for the retarded to stop his powers from taking over the Elders. Right... Kev really seems to want to make this be a Pink Floyd The Wall esque moment...but. No. Tune is forgettable and the lyrics are, again, flat. Shigesato did some nice graphics for this one though.\n\nSo he goes outside FOR THE FIRST TIME EVAR.\n\nLove Song - Right, you met this chick. She\'s all cool and into you. You\'re both rebels and she\'s a REVOLUTIONARY VIVA ZAPATA. Sorry, but this story is going nowhere. Okay, they kiss and run off into the forests. Lyrics here are simply wretched (sorry Kev) and the graphics make Rina look retarded herself. Tune is rather catchy though.\n\nEnding music - beautiful. Expands on the tune of the overture and takes it into an almost apocalyptic direction. It\'s wonderful and causes one to think of What Could\'ve Been if the story had been expaned upon the lyrics refined to exude the class that Shigesato so desperately wanted ZZT to have.\n\nAnd then it just drops us, DO THEY *REALLY* live Happily Ever After or DID THEY JUST SCREW THEMSELVES OVER!?!\n\nSadly, it could\'ve been interesting to see Rina\'s revolutionary personality taken deeper - why is she fighting? What is Jorosh the elder really up to? What\'s so damn special about Micah?\n\nSadly, none of this will ever be found out. Kev intentionally made his ending ambiguous out of keeping things \"open to interpretation.\" The only problem is that he should\'ve made a story that was interpretable in the first place. As it stands, we\'re left some pretty incomprehensible symbolism, athmospheric graphics with no athmosphere, music that\'s up and down and then some. Yeah. Admittedly Kev had alot of frustration over this one, but he should\'ve kept at it in some spots. Oh well.\n\nA 4 for nostalgia from talking with Kev at 1am about preteen angst when I was 14. 2.5 for actual quality.',2.5,'2005-04-06','172.195.145.118\r',442),(1161,'Kind of like a Darkthrone album.','MaðTom','madtom@gmail.com','You know, this used to be my favourite ZZT game, even after playing the requisite Zenith Nadir and drac0 classics that comprised my earlier obsessions. Of course, back then I was trying to stake some sort of claim as a ZZT musician, and I suppose I must have thought that, much like some indie rock kiddie, a good way to get one\'s name in the open was to idolise something almost nobody else seemed to really like.\n\nTranslating anything symphonic - or beyond two instruments, really - in ZZT is not an easy task. I\'ve been there. For half of the projects the wise musician will realise about halfway through that this simply isn\'t working, that even alternating notes just doesn\'t make it sound right. I\'ve dumped plenty of tracks that way. kev takes on the (in my opinion) insurmountable task of doing this with ONE track of sound. Bluntly, I wouldn\'t even *entertain* the idea of doing this, and given kev\'s ambitions I think it\'s been done very well.\n\nWhile I am not surprised to learn from the previous review that kev-san was or is regarded as a musical prodigy in the vein of Mooseka, *Freedom* just doesn\'t work. Grainy Testa graphics with no playability, a remarkably brief story with vague utopian connotations, a hollow love-interest, topped off with the wails, squeals and buzzes of a minor-key track - no matter how good music and the story behind it is, you cannot convey it in its full glory through a beeping PC speaker. kev himself acknowledges this in the editor notes.\n\nThis is why I now firmly believe that the idea of a ZZT musical just isn\'t going to work. It really didn\'t even work with *The Rose*, and that\'s WiL, for crying out loud. ZZT music has and always will take an unfortunate backseat to the actual action, the characters battling it out onscreen, the puzzles, the shooting ruffians while running through endless ammo fields.\n\nIf you\'re as talented an artist as kev-san evidently is, and you have the disposal of musical instruments, paintbrushes, some kind of canvas, everything you need, the world is your oyster.

You\'re helping Tom, your abusive buddy, to find his mother. Odd that the game is subtitled: Tom\'s Adventure, as you are doing most of the leg work, shooting things (every huge mentally handicaped person should own a gun!) and solving a few rudimentary puzzles, including slider puzzle that slider rookies should be able to muscle through.\n\nLet\'s get the bad out of the way first.\nThere are a few hangups in gameplay. I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to move the \"heavier\" set of boulders. (You\'ll see if you play.) They were punished with a good strong ZAP. Another hangup, not so much in the beginning or middle of the game as the end, is the lack of ammo. This can be blamed on an oversight on my part, as I did not stock up before heading to the next city, but I did expect another city to have another store. Ammo shortages are mainly a problem when you try and blast your way through dense \"forest\" but obviously it was an intentional decision.\n\nThe graphics ranged from stylistically minimalist, to lazily sparce and hurried. The city especially looked good, as did the sewers in the city. Some forest boards looked like forests, others looked like black paths through a green field. I liked the title screen, it was retro and appropriate.\n\nThere is no music in the game. Sounds were limited mainly to what sounds ZZT normally makes.\n\nThe writing is hard to discuss. There are some rather eyebrow raising and vulger things thrown in loosely among most of the game\'s (excuse this expression please) comedic retard-banter. Some there are several points where Tom\'s homophobia is highlighted, and also his brutality to George.

Perhaps most of the mojo of this game is unintentional; i would not be surprised if it was.  You are a soldier fighting (Aliens.), so we\'re told by the king.  the game starts with an enigmatic \"What am i doing here?\" which could have been uttered by your character, one of the king\'s talking guards, or the narrator\'s eye now cast upon this unlikely hero, or intended to be uttered by you, the player, upon entering this gameworld.  When you and your fellow soldiers are lined up in front of a bunch of aliens, the weapons of your compatriots are wholly ineffective - you must go in, guns blazing, only 50 ammo and a lot of scum to kill.  The gameplay is much like any newbie game thereafter, with the strange addendum of people shouting catchphrases at you at every turn, things like \"what you see is not what you think\" when traversing a mountain range or \"we are counting on you to kill their leader\" when their \'leader\' appears to be noting more than a bunch of discombobulated centipede segments.  Perhaps if mr miller has played through his game even once, or had worked on it a bit more or been exposed to other games by which he could benchmark his own, we would not have this splended gem of oddness.  I like it because it pays attention to the things that are important - giving the king a name, giving the soldier\'s story some attention beyond the introduction, giving us more during and even after the ass kicking ensues - while paying no attention whatsoever to those things which one would expect to pay attention to when making a game; do my objects do what they\'re supposed to do?  Does the layout of my boards make any visual sense?\n\nI hope beyond anything that games like this are somewhere, somehow, being made deliberately - with a little attention this game could be a classic gem, as is, it still shares the spotlight as one of the best zzt games ever.',3,'2005-05-06','12.202.241.141\r',44),(1188,'Best ZZT Games Ever: AMTR-SE.ZZT','WiL','masterwil@gmail.com','I recently played all the ZZT games made from 1991 to at least the end of 2003, maybe beyond - nearly two thousand games in all.

All the bosses excluding the last pirate and last monster are pretty easy, but still can hit you a few times, which is a problem, seeing as health is pretty limited in the game. The main difficulty of the last two bosses comes from their star throwing. Which isn\'t overwhelming for the most part.

This is also one in which you mainly play as Joe, instead of Asher.  I really love the storyline as well.  The whole plot is based on Time Travel.  I would definitly have to say that this is one of the best games I played.  I don\'t normally give games a five unless they deserve it.  If you play the whole series, starting with 1, then you really get hooked.  Even though this is more laid back than the others, the puzzles are harder, and some are even more fun.  However, as good as this game is, it does have it\'s cons.  Here\'s a breakdown:\n\n\nSound: 5/5\nYou never hear sound if you don\'t need to, no annoying music while you are playing the level, and in my opinion, perfectly timed.\n\nGraphics: 4.9/5\nThis was one of the only downfalls.  On the Panaxis, the white door nearest to the key dispenser is hard to see.  Of course, if you touch everything, then it is quite easy, but for \"thinkers\" it doesn\'t quite work.\n\nMobility: 5/5\nYes, there are some tight spaces, but unless I was getting keys, I never had to move too much.

There is so much packed into this baby that three of the boards exceed 19K, and one exceeds 18K!\n\nPeople have complained about the ridiculous difficulty of Mission: Enigma (especially the final board), and few have beaten it without cheating. Below is a complete walkthrough.\n\nIt\'s without a doubt the best 10-board game (12 after title screen and ending) ever made, although it\'s a shame that the plot wasn\'t more fleshed out, possibly because rei-chan didn\'t want to risk runtime errors. It still deserves a 5/5.\n\nWALKTHROUGH\nSteps starting with the word SAVE require precision timing. If you mess up, you won\'t get a second chance. Most importantly, do not waste your ammo!\n\nPART I - MAIN FLOOR\n1. SAVE. Hide north of the bush until the sentry goes to sleep. Enter the fortress.\n2. Read the DOS 9.12h manual. Enter the southwest room.\n3. SAVE. Stand a bit away from the knife trap. Activate it, then step out of the way and touch it from the north or south as it flies toward you.\n4. Shoot an empty bottle (ammo=5). Pick up the shard.\n5. Enter the southeast room. Touch the guard to stab him. Grab both items on his body. Unlock the door he was guarding and enter the basement.\n6. Light a torch. Ignore the oil barrel and bucket (red herring) and keep walking ahead. Touch the guard to stab him. Grab both items on his body. Pull the bar to the right and walk west. Set AC to maximum. Turn off the water valve. Walk west to see a left bucket. Move that bucket three spaces east so that it\'s aligned with the straight pipe section jutting out of the wall. Shoot the straight pipe section (ammo=4).\n7. SAVE. Turn on the water valve, then immediately turn it off. Pick up the bucket filled with water. Return to the main floor.\n8. Pick up the ammo in the southwest room (ammo=6). Enter the northwest room. Ignore the bottle of red wine (red herring).\n9. SAVE. Shoot the east air duct (ammo=5). It might take a couple of tries to get this, but don\'t use more than 2 ammo to do it. This walkthrough will assume you destroyed it using one shot. Enter the north room.\n10. Push the crate so that it\'s adjacent to the air duct, destroying it. Enter the northeast room with the crate.\n11. SAVE. Shoot the air duct (ammo=4).\n12. SAVE. Move the mirror east, then north so that it\'s positioned at the northeast corner. Do not slam it against the wall or else it will break!\n13. Exchange the diamond on the pedastal with the ruby ring. Fire the lazer. Touch the flames to douse them with your water bucket.\n14. Push the crate so that it\'s west of the lower part of the spring. Activate the spring, then push the wall back. Push the crate one space west to destroy the air duct. This will move the crate one space north. Now push the crate all the way to the end of the hallway and destroy that air duct. The crate will then move one space south due to the explosion.\n15. Push the crate east to where the air duct in the southeast room once was, then walk around and push the crate north. Now you can push the crate into the west room. There are a couple of things to take care of before you do that, though.\n16. Walk outside and pick up the clay. Enter the blue passage, light a torch, and pick up the gloves. Walk out and re-enter the fortress.\n17. Re-enter the basement via the southeast room. Light a torch if necessary. Cover the punctured water pipe with the clay, then turn on the water valve. Return to the main floor.\n18. Use the crate to destroy the air duct in that room, then push it into the north room and onto the right panel. Now you can enter the second floor!\n\nPART II - SECOND FLOOR AND COMMTHOUGHT\n19. Here is the electric maze solution. When you solve it, enter the north passage:\nA. Center room: Press\nB. Left room: Middle, left, right\nC. North room: Left, right\nD. Left room: Middle\nE. Right room (3 buttons): Left, middle\nF. Far right room: Press\n20. Press the switch, then enter CommThought.\n21. Clear the rubble. Walk over to the green defensive chip, making sure not to touch anything else! The right section of the defensive chip will have a panel. Open it and grab the silver key. Leave.\n22. Re-enter the second floor and unlock the silver door. You\'ll end up in the basement again after going through a series of passages. Light a torch, then make a note of the manual override code. Leave and re-enter CommThought.\n23. All of the purple buttons have a letter designation. Press them in the exact order of the manual override code. The forcefield should lower. Fix the electric wire break, then leave.\n24. Press the switch and enter the green room to play GEMini.\n25. SAVE. Defeat CommThought at GEMini. The general strategy is to move pieces 1 and 2 towards the center. Once you do that, it will be impossible for CommThought to win.\n26. Enter the passage to the right of CommThought to get one ammo (ammo=5). Attempt to enter the left passage, then quickly touch the blockade. Once Karen finishes casting Levitate, enter the passage.\n27. SAVE. RUN!!!\n\nPART III - BOSS FIGHT AND CAVERN OF ILLUSION\n28. SAVE. Don\'t attack Karen or Maleen. Instead, shoot Dr. Kris up to five times by continually touching your console, then finish him off with a melee attack. Once you control Karen, alternate casting spells against the demon and melee attacking the demon on your end. You should deal damage faster than Maleen can heal. When you win, head north to enter the hardest section of the game.\nNOTE: If you\'re not fast enough and Karen dies, you won\'t get the extended ending.\n29. SAVE. Be quick, as you\'ll need every last bit of that time! Grab the three visible rocks (ammo=3). Position yourself so that you\'re south of the right dragon, then touch it twice. As it opens its mouth, move away and it should shoot south to reveal another rock. grab it (ammo=4).\n30. SAVE. Talk to Karen to get her out of the way. Face west of the right dragon and touch it. Step away and it should destroy the left dragon. Touch its remains to grab the golden key. Touch its remains again so that it moves aside. Walk on the space where it used to be, then touch the west wall to pick up a hidden rock (ammo=5). Unlock the door.\n31. SAVE. Carefully shoot the snakes, as you can only afford one shot for each of them (ammo=3). Unlock and enter the room to the north.\n32. SAVE. Here is the solution to the Music-Lock combonation [sic] room. The numbers represent equivalent positions on a clock. 12 is the north door, and 6 is the south door. There is no 3, 6, or 9.\nA. 11, 5, 8\nB. 11, 5, 2, 11, 5, 7\nC. 2, 11, 5, 11, 5, 8, 11, 5, 2\nD. 11, 5, 1, 4, 10, 4, 11\nWhen you clear the room, you should have at least 140 ticks remaining on the clock. If you don\'t, you won\'t have enough time to escape. Head north.\n33. SAVE. There is a suspicious piece of the wall sticking out. Shoot it, making sure that there is a one space gap for it to register (ammo=2). It should turn into a boulder. Push that boulder two spaces west so that it\'s out of the way.\n34. Unlock and enter the west room (the one with the triangle things). Those triangles are stalactites. Shoot the rightmost one from the south, again making sure that there is a one-space gap (ammo=1). It should fall one space south and turn into a boulder.\n35. Push that boulder east. Open the door to the east room, then push the boulder east so that it dislodges the key from the pedestal and takes the place where the key once was. Grab the key, then turn the water valve on and off.\n36. Go back into the north room and shoot east into the river (ammo=0). This will reveal a secret room. Use the lettered buttons to change the white door into the matching door of your key. Each letter represents a different color.\n37. Once that\'s done, hurry through the colored door and out of the fortress! You win!',5,'2006-01-31','216.99.61.30\r',378),(1286,'Island of ZZT','Quantum P.','christophermounce@gmail.com','At first glance, *Island of ZZT* isn\'t too impressive; it just looks like the average ZZTer\'s first game. However, when I played the game, I noticed a few things that make me think that Ajc1490 has a bright future in the ZZT world.\n\nThe graphics, although primitive, improve throughout the game. Many of the boards show use of textures; for example, the sand has a random appearance, there are waves in the water, *etc*... The pathways have wavy, flowing shapes, fitting the natural settings of the beach and the woods. Palm trees and thick vines give the player some scenery to look at. The dark cellar was especially well-done. It was very simple, but the dark colors chosen did a good job of theming the area, and the bones and blood were a nice touch! For a beginner, these are graphics to be proud of, and I encourage Ajc1490 to keep developing his style.\n\nThe gameplay of *Island of ZZT* reminds me of older ZZT games. Most of the monsters in the game are the built-in lions, tigers, bears, and centipedes, which aren\'t used that much in modern games; there could have been more object enemies. The game is easy and not terribly innovative by today\'s standards, but it can be seen that some thought went into the game. One of the things that struck me was the dying man in the native village. The typical ZZT cliche for giving the player money is to have a an unexplained stash of gems. Instead, in this game there is some explanation for the money; the dying man, reflecting on the fact that earthly riches mean nothing in the afterlife, gives you his money.\n\n*Island of ZZT* is not an epic, groundbreaking game, but it does have a certain charm to it. As Ajc1490 improves as a programmer, I believe that he will go on to create some very good games. I hope to see more of his work in the future!',3,'2006-02-20','140.142.173.15\r',1939),(1287,'Whoa.','My Liver Hurtz','myliverhurtz@3web.net','I heard FYNDR\'s request for a review of this game, so, I decided to take a gander at it. I wasn\'t expecting very much... but, thankfully, I got more than I was expecting. This game is by no means an awful newbie game, instead, it was an enjoyable one. Granted, I haven\'t played much ZZT in the past few years and I\'m just getting back into the swing of things now.\n\nThe graphics were very, very simplistic, so not many marks there. Where my score of 2.5 comes from is the concept and the humour. The concept could have been executed much more, but, FYNDR more than displays enough potential to create some very trippy and intriguing game concepts.\n\nThe atmosphere of Lucidity from the title screen is in tune with the rest of the game. The odd man out is the opening board which sets a darker, more serious tone that I would\'ve preferred been explored, that I thought opened up a lot of possibilities for a great game.\n\nSo, I was a bit disappointed by the typical ZZT going-ons with this game. The humour, though, for some reason really got me. \"Hot dogses\" and the hot dog stand spontaniously collapsing made me laugh a lot more than they should have. I suppose it\'s just because it doesn\'t take itself too seriously... granted, 99% of ZZT games don\'t, but, this one took another route in the humour which I can\'t quite pin. FYNDR\'s humour is more defined in Agent Blue, I believe.\n\nAnyways, Lucidity is a nice diversion. I enjoyed playing it, though, it is familiar ground. Very familiar ground.\n\nWhat I\'d love to see is for FYNDR to hone in on his particular sense of humour and style of storytelling and be less general. I\'ll discuss this more in my review of Agent Blue.',2,'2006-02-23','199.243.20.27\r',1940),(1288,'Promising','My','myliverhurtz@3web.net','I found this game to be more enjoyable than Lucidity. The story is less promising, but, it gives what it promises. The graphics leave much, much to be desired, and there\'s very, very, very little innovation in terms of gameplay.\n\nI said I\'d concentrate on his humour for this review, though, so I will. FYNDR incorporates tried-and-true ZZT humour and cliches into this game. It gives it a very, very generic feel. Where I sense a difference, though, is in a few key moments of pure hilarity. The ones I can remember the most, since I haven\'t finished the game, are of the first level on the Cuban superjet. After breaking out of a jailcell (get used to this) your partner in jailbreaking gets mowed down by a million guys with guns. Then, simaltaniously, they all run out of ammo and retreat before seeing you. Your partner\'s staggered back with blood dripping on the floor. It\'s really, really, really funny. Then there\'s the plumbing system placed right where you need it, where you can overhear the enemy giving you a secret to be found in there. It\'s just funny.\n\nThe reason I gave this a higher score than I normally would is because of that promise of humour which I don\'t tend to see in ZZT games. Then again, I don\'t tend to play too many newbie games, so, it might not be all that original. In any case, I think FYNDR shows incredible promise. If he can drop generic humor and clicheic gameplay and focus in on his own particular brand of funny and model his gameplay after it - with good graphics - I can see myself really, really enjoying one of his creations.',2.5,'2006-02-23','199.243.20.27\r',1938),(1289,'There\'s something about incomplete games.','Darkmatt','darkmatt717@hotmail.com','Oh, the wonders of the Random button.

The only thing that kept me playing was curiosity about how the game would end up. There is a story, but it is very vague, and it seemed hastily typed. The gameplay is standard; you win the game by trying every object with every other object. This can get tiresome and even frustrating. Some things just made me wonder; for example, why is there only one thing - a fish - in the spring? Shouldn\'t there be at least two objects in every scene to justify the cursor engine that is used to select them?\n\n*4* is an neat little demonstration of an innovative engine, but it doesn\'t have much replay value.

Sitting in a chair that doesn\'t belong to you is NOT a legitimate reason for terminating the game! There were a few bugs that occurred later due to the lag of flag clears. Very disappointing, because these mistakes sometimes render the game unbeatable unless you find out what the flags are and set them yourself (not that I\'m that crazy or anything)...\nThe author seemed to be very antipathetic in regards to cheating. Often times when you completed a puzzle a message would say something along the lines of \"HOORAaaaaaY! You Got OUT of tHe Building!

ZZT isn\'t well suited to self-insertion because there\'s no way for the players to input their own name.  Make the player be a character, like, for example, a slug named Bob.  Make the character have some reason why he is the man for the job, like, for example, being the only slug stupid enough to enter the salt mines and stop an evil wizard from raising an army of saltmen to conquer slugkind.  Make sure that this is reinforced throughout the game or people will lose their anchoring to the reason they are playing.  The ZZT format does not have the subtlety required to eliminate the Puritan work ethic of standard gaming.

Instead of say many officers like this I\'d rather like to see 2 or 3 officers who are fast and shoot lots at you.  Maybe they shooting them only makes them angrier?  Maybe it takes 2 shots to kill them?  (The zap function is great for minor bosses or slightly stronger enemies!)  And when they run from you try and have them run towards the exit or something.

Maybe you could have instead it hurt you or something instead of kill you.\n\nThirdly, the text is somewhat unimaginative.  I liked the begining a fair bit and the one cinimatic sequence a bit less but it otherwise seemed rather dull.  Maybe while your shooting them they\'re could be talking going on like\n\nGuard 1:  Men!  Pull your guns out!\nGuard 2:  Stun I presume?\nGuard 1:  Not on my life your not!  Kill...\n\nor\n\nGuard 1:  Holy crap!  Its radio active!\nGuard 1:  Kill it!  Kill it!\nYou:  You mean the guards?\nGuard 2:  No...  Except for guard 1 maybe.\nGuard 1:  No!  No!

It has many aspects missing from less than adaquate titles. First off, it has a plot! You start in a field, in the middle of a circle of stones. Like the Avatar of Ultima, you are a stranger in a strange land destined to bring peace. The setting mostly medevil with a small amount of tech (steam boat?) and the graphics represent the mood nicely. The game play is a plesent mix of styles and while there is some generic shooting (hard to avoid I know) the game keeps you guessing, especially in the forest, which I thought was the highlight gameplay-wise.\n\nStill there are a few hang-ups. This first happens after the difficult engine room on the boat when it begins to sink.  Running from the water(slimes) is hard, and in the last room your compainions can block the steel doors allowing the entire room to be flooded. I\'ll give a piece of advice that was given to me, having objects follow you board by board  looks unprofessional as they don\'t really match up and can get in the way. It\'s better (depending on the situation) to just assume the player represents the group. The other hangup was the castle, which, when compared to the rest of the game, seems rushed and is essentially just one big lion shootout.\n\nThe boss fight in the end was satisfying and a lot of fun I must say.\n\nGraphically the game looks pretty good. There are a few bland areas, namely the begining in the snow, and the king\'s secret throne room. The towns are the opposite and look good because a varity of fakes are used for ground cover(along with some fades for water such), but there\'s no texture to the snow, and the floor of the castle is pretty bland (think carpet, like in the temple).\n\nIf FYNDR continues to progress with his games like he did here, we\'re in for some awesome games soon (We\'d better be)',3.5,'2006-08-04','24.151.141.255\r',1976),(1340,'...','Quindo','','This game made me sick when i played it.

There are some RPG battle, 4 or 5 I think, which basically consists of each character having an attack that does  1 damage and always hits, or an attack that does 2 damage and sometimes misses. Other than that there is very little gameplay save from moving your characters through the world.\n\nThe majority of the game is in fact a spiritual catharsis your hipster heros undergo to escape from Hell. While it uses many religious and philosophical models for the world it creates, it uses them rather freely to both poke fun at and make a point about specifically Judeo-Christian religions. The several diatribes the game forces you to digest can range from funny, to poignant, to just plain dumb. The intellegensia that your heros seem to represent (man I can\'t stand most hipsters) is sometimes distasteful. I sort of hoped they\'d all die in the end (past already being dead and in hell). The three characters you lead are all pretty irritating. The religious elements that were used to make a plot were good, but often the ones that were used to make a point were dull and preachy. It seems quite simply that kev-san had a lot on his plate and needed to get it all out in one game.\n\nGraphically the game holds its own. There is a wide range of colours used appropriately, and some boards make the game look like it would fit well into the trippy genre. The battle scenes are a little bland and only lightly animated.\n\nThe music is quite good. It\'s used frequently and almost on every board.

This game is a stunning example of the first.\n\nOn your mark, get set, go get some purple keys.\n\nThis is the third game this author has made in the classic style.

There has been a lot of progression over the three games, in all areas. The text is very limited and not distracting. It\'s appropriately light and humourous when it does appear.\n\nGraphically the game takes a harder line than it\'d predecessors. It has more of its own style than the previous games in his series. There more attention paid to patterns: with walls made from fades, to checkerboards. Colour is used appropriately to create unique atmospheres for each seperate.\n\nNow the game itself. The castle is immedietly imposing in it\'s size when you begin and start to poke around the fringes of the main area. Monster scare you away from certain areas, imposing puzzles in others. Mysterious areas you can see but not reach are everywhere. You\'ll soon discover that this place, this game, is BIG. You\'ll think you\'ll never see a purple key until you\'re halfway through the game. You\'ll be almost right.\n\nShooting things is of course a must. The game makes use of different coloured monsters to represent different behaviour. (Blue ruffians slower, dumber than purple ones.) Monsters are not overused and are placed rather tactically, like tigers who jump you through a breakable wall when their shooting direction changes. Ammo and health was in abundance, but at a good balance.\n\nPuzzles were a mix between old classics (three lakes) to newer and more clever ones. One of the best consisted of blocks that rotated around richochets upon being touched. And another, the opening of the vault.

All it is, is a pusher that is stopped by a slider.  Very poor use of a slider.\n-The animals you have to, or feel like shooting only take one shot to kill.  You have plenty of places to get ammo in the game.  Make use of it!\n-The mall was all kinds of colors.  Normally this dosn\'t sound to bad, but the way you arranged them was poor.  If it is supposed to be cheap paint then maybe you should have only 1 or 2 colors from the origonal set.  Not all 7.\n-There are many bugs such as things not changing properly, and you left in the object that gives you 20,000 health, gems, ammo, torches, and score.  Making the game kind of pointless...\n-The game feels so closed.  Especially since you start outside, theres yellow walls all around you.  Tell me...  What is the point of all these walls?  If your not supposed to go in a certain direction then just don\'t link boards in that direction.\n-The games area, was pointless too.  All you have to do is cheat by buying one game then go back through the door, and you could just jump to the next game.\n-You also ripped off an entire board from the tour of zzt.  If your going to rip off boards, at make a point of telling the player where you got the boards from, and why your not going out of your way to make a half decent puzzle yourself.\n-The courthouse is horribly incomplete.  A malfunction with the elevator?  Pfft.\n-I hate the colors that flash over and over again really fast.  At best it hurts my eyes, and the worst you could is possibly give my elipsy.\n-The ending is lacking.  All the farmer does is congratulate you for a job well done.  And thats it.  Why not go into detail about how everything turns out?  What happenes to crokerville?  Does the mall ever get better painting?  (They should, I payed 100g\'s for a saphire necklace!

This isn\'t a believable castle - how could it be? - but it\'s pleasant to look at, and the color schemes are coherent and restrained. Newton knows how to lay out a fine-looking board.\n\nThe castle\'s architecture is equally effective. Newton (usually) avoids forcing the player to cross long, empty distances, re-uses space in fairly elegant ways, and maintains a continual sense of exploration. He has to - there\'s no plot to keep things moving. But there is that locked door you saw earlier, that intriguing chamber that you can\'t get to right now...\n\nThe gameplay is competent, well-paced, and, with the exception of one interesting maze -\n\nCONS:\n\n- cheerfully unoriginal. It\'s not that Newton imitates the STYLE of the Sweeney games - he lifts entire sequences out of them. When pushing bombs around to blow up a field of breakables without opening a path for some star-shooters, I\'m tempted to edit the board and clear a path with the spacebar. I mean, I\'ve played this already, in Town of ZZT.\n\nIn one way or another, that goes for almost every one of the puzzles. The old-school formula can work if the puzzles somehow surprise us, but here we get, at best, a dubious \"gotcha\" when we render a slider puzzle unwinnable, or get ambushed by ruffians.\n\n(Not that there\'s anything wrong with ruffian ambushes. The most fun I had playing involved duplicators, ruffians, and the realization that I was trapped in a mausoleum with fast, angry ghosts.)\n\nBasically, this game throws fewer curveballs than the games it imitates. The slider puzzles are easy, one of the teleporter mazes is so linear as to be a ping-pong path in disguise, and the prefab enemies very rarely overwhelm us. A treasure hunt involves following literal directions precisely, a machine can be fixed by shooting breakable walls, a multiple-choice riddle game can be solved with basic ZZT knowledge, and a musical combo lock can be opened by - well, if you don\'t have working speakers, you\'d better ?+zap.\n\nLittle thought is needed here. This isn\'t Barjesse\'s Nightmare, or anything like that.\n\nAre there any original puzzles? A few. But generally, the ones that aren\'t from the Sweeney games can be found in later ones, though the resemblance generally isn\'t so perfect as to suggest direct imitation. More likely, there\'s just so much you can do with this formula.\n\nAll this said, I wish Newton had directly copied one more thing from earlier games, though. Converting ammo, torches, and health to score at the end would have been a good move, and rating the player\'s performance based on this would have been even better. It\'s too easy just to win, given how forgiving the game is.\n\nNote: Most of the above misgivings might well be irrelevant if you didn\'t spend your childhood playing old ZZT games.\n\nRATING:\n\nLong CONS section aside, this is a good game. Castle of ZZT is playable, colorful, and fun, and it\'s laudable that Newton wrote a solid game for such a limited audience. You\'ve got to love ZZT to turn out a game like this when it\'s bound to get a grand total of two reviews. Newton, to quote a million hack reviewers, \"respects the material.\" 5/5.\n\nOn the other hand, if this game had been released three years ago, it would have been regarded as solid, but not brilliant. 4/5.\n\nSo I\'ll put a 4, but if you\'re new to ZZT, add an extra point. I unhesitatingly recommend Castle of ZZT to new players.',4,'2006-12-27','24.171.133.70\r',1987),(1372,'Nice improvement.','Moonpie','moonpie@zultimate.org','Your original Skate game wasn\'t quite as good as this.

This is one of the most underrated games ever, and nearly everyone knows it.

That\'s one of the things I don\'t like about some people. This was actually something new instead of being dragged on and on through a game\'s plot without so much as a by-your-leave. Nipple Saga focuses on the battle and techinques system more than the plot; and I think that\'s great.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nThe gameplay is what Nipple Saga was mostly about anyway; the unique learning system and being able to choose your own techniques is much better than being stuck with just one.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nWhat do I have to say?

First announced at the Bigger Nigger Corporation Conference along with Nipple, and Nipple Zwei, it would be another few years before the public actually saw anything specific, at a special event held in England\'s Strood Hills. With all the major project players at hand, it seemed as if a release would be pending shortly thereafter. E3 1978 hit and attendees got a chance to play a demo build. After a controversial reception given the dramatic change in combat gameplay, the phallic giant went silent and the world could only guess as to the fate of this constantly belated title. Then things got even worse: Snazin Smith, the “brother” of Nipple Saga, left Bigger Niggers to form his own company, taking his saucy trumpet (the “composer” of Nipple) with him. Hope sank to new lows when gamers learned that the project director, Camera J, resigned for sodomy related reasons.\n\nJust when an all-out cancellation seemed the next logical announcement, July 2003 arrived and with it, the Bigger Niggers Party. It was at this pivotal convention that the RPG giant unleashed a gauntlet of good news: NipSaga was not cancelled but instead, pending release immediately; NipSaga had a theme song (now a pre-requisite for the series), NipSaga had received a new director, and NipSaga had matured in design over the years. Those in attendance were able to play a brand new demo which North American gamers would later received (slightly edited) bundled as a promotional item along with Plunger SE in November. It was fever pitch and now only a matter of time before the inevitable: the day Nipple Saga would finally release and end the litany of setbacks associated with it once and for all.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to “D-Day”, NipSaga received some impressive acclaim, such as a rare perfect score by the Japanese gaming publication, Weekly Faggotsu. While the magazine\'s reviews were as emaciated as ever (offering no real whatsoever into the score), it was quite clear that something was aloof for this radically altered Nipple to earn such a coveted tally. With the game receiving high marks from competing periodicals as well, it was obvious that NipSaga was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe Ideal\n\nDuring the development process of Nipple, Bigger Niggers employees made it known that they wished to do away with random battles, a de-facto “staple” of most every RPG and perhaps-to many gamers-the single most aggravating element of play. While the bastard Nipple Zwei managed to forgo the invisible encounters, it seemed unrealistic that ZZT could ever handle a game as multimedia mad as a Nipple Saga and have enough power to process monsters in real time. Yet amazingly, NipSaga features just that: it is by far the most beautiful game in the entire series with stunning graphics, state-of-the-art CG movies, loads of voice acting and cut scenes, a lengthy quest, and yet…no random encounters.\n\nCombat Crisis\n\nAs mentioned earlier, if there could be one single element of NipSaga\'s design that has provoked the greatest controversy, it would be the combat engine. Essentially a simplified version of the “hands off/AI-based” fighting in MMORPGs (like FLYFF), many players found it impossible to accept a game system that refused to include a structured, turn-based system of input. In a sense, you are truly a “guide” for character input during battle, with the computer handling all of the actual attacking, defending, and, if the opponent\'s proximity is close enough, movement as well. As revolting as this idea might sound to some, consider that previous Nipple installments offered the exact same properties, if not even more restricted; aside from choosing options from a menu and confirming, the computer always controlled everything else-nobody should be kidding themselves into thinking that they ever had total control over anything.\n\nBattle Basics\n\nWhile wandering around in a field or dungeon, you will see monsters. To initiate combat, push the “Space Bar” to shoot in the direction of the target(s). Watch as a bullet line draws itself and connects with the selected foe. Use of items and magic occurs in the same fashion. An important element to note is that in Active Mode-the ideal play experience-all of this occurs in real time which means that monsters can-and will-attack you while mulling over what to do. If your have the AI set, party members will automatically attack according to the pre-set \"instructions\" when their bullets hit.\n\nIf things get too tough (and they will), it is possible to flee from battle, however given the nature of combat, that hardly means you are off the hook. As FLYFF players may know all too well, enraged monsters will trail after your party hoping to slay whomever they can before you run out of their reach. While opponents that deal melee attacks prove less of a problem, those with long range and/or magical capabilities can quite easily defeat a party in crisis even when things seem safe. The best advice is to plan adequately for fights: avoid battles in heavily concentrated enemy territory if your party is low on health and/or restorative items. Don\'t bite off more than you can chew as jews are not all of the same level of difficulty even if they are all in the same area.\n\nLust for Licenses and a Chaste Challenge\n\nWith each new Nipple comes a new gameplay gimmick that serves to mix things up and prevent the adventure from feeling too close to the previous. NipSaga introduces the License Point system, an innovative skill building service that combines elements of Nipple\'s item-based character growth and Nipple Zwei\'s popular Date Rape Board. While characters level up in a traditional manner (via Experience Points earned from defeating monsters), they also receive Rape Points which are used to “purchase” new abilities, attacks, magic, Fag Sluts, (etc) from a sub-screen of the main menu. Different abilities have different point requirements, meaning that players will find themselves stalking monsters at all hours in an attempt to create the ideal character. Because of the fluid combat however, this is far less of a hassle than were gamers forced to deal with constant combat loading and a systematic input selection process. Even better, this system allows for incredible customization as players can build the character they wish to without worrying about a pre-determined “path” like so many other games opt for. Tied into this process is the dynamic of “unlocking” the ability to use more powerful equipment, thus ensuring that you can not simply horde gems (they give you health!), waltz into a shop and leave with high power offensive gear that all but eliminates any and all challenge to be had.\n\nAnd what a challenge there is…many gamers have no doubt lamented over the exponentially decreasing difficulty in this genre as time passes. Whereas they use to be just plain unforgiving in the earlier day of gaming, in 2006 it is not uncommon to play through an entire RPG without facing obliteration even once. This absence of difficulty all but ensures that players rarely-if ever-need to plan ahead, or need to think period. Just plow through each area until reaching the next one. Obviously the manner in which equipment upgrades worked heavily factored into this matter. NipSaga on the other hand, is hardly something you can breeze through. While not as bad as an MMORPG, even Leveling Up your character takes a lot of time; do not expect to jump from Level 2 to Level 10 in a span of a few meager hours. You must work for your payoffs and that adds a tremendous sense of accomplishment in the end.\n\nThose gamers sick and tired of pathetic boss monsters that offer little to no challenge whatsoever will be absolutely thrilled to know that NipSaga is a real piece of work. Bosses can do so much, really: deal incredible amounts of damage, use special attacks that all but obliterate your party, at times even call reinforcements all while possessing a startling amount of Hit Points ensuring that even bouts of “power leveling” may prove useless. Instead of regulating the difficulty to far-off hidden bosses that only the most adamant players ever see, Bigger Niggers opted to make each and every major opponent a fight-something that could not be more welcome in a game like this. Suffice to say that players will be facing major setbacks in progress if they don\'t adequately set up their buns.\n\nTown Traveler and Dreamy Dungeons\n\nWith the exception of Nipple\'s lost city of Kowloon or Fort Boyard, nothing much can prepare one for the impressive size and scope of the town environments in NipSaga. Spanning multiple screens and simply sprawling, it is possible to spend hours talking with all the various NPCs littered about, shopping, scoping out new Sexy Conquests, or simply marveling at how amazing the view is. When approaching a NPC whom you can speak with, a small “happy face” icon appears along with the character\'s name. During longer conversation, an option to view a “Log” appears, allowing you to scroll back to earlier points in the discourse should you wish to recount important details. So large, detailed, and complex are the environments that they must actually be broken up into segments for ZZT to handle such a load.\n\nWhile NipSaga takes place in its established world, seeing the various lifeforms, races and overall settings in true 2-D is an experience like no other. So many competing game companies have tried relentlessly to create this kind of virtual world yet, aside from online based societies, it seems impossible to list any that achieved this kind of success. At times you may question just how Bigger Niggers managed to pull off such feats in hardware that the industry claims is outdated and ancient.\n\nDungeons are simply magnificent: there is no other way to put it. Time and time again game companies craft boring looking environments with little-to-no excitement in them, however every area in NipSaga is not only marvelous to look at, but entertaining to explore. Many players will be shocked by the sheer size of these locations as well, for they span multiple screens and can take quite some time to explore. While field locations tend to be more simplistic, the actual dungeons themselves are ornate looking regions with an astonishing sense of grandeur, detail, and scope. In a very real sense, it is like ZZT SPORTS or Strood Fireworks Display but even more epic.\n\nClan Conquest\n\nThose familiar with MMORPGs may already be familiar with the idea of undertaking missions/quests for rewards, hunting for specific monsters, or helping out your clan to improve its reputation. (Additionally, those familiar with Nipple will also find familiarity, as well as a certain Bigelow). NipSaga features a much more open-ended vision of progression such that the player is frequently given the opportunity to undertake side-stories and quests that have little to nothing to do with the main story, but which yield major benefits. Additionally, as you progress throughout the game, the party earns Clan Points which can be redeemed for rewards of increasing value, as well as a prominent reputation.\n\nWhile the prospect of monster hunting might not be appealing to everyone, the game does not always force you to partake on these extravagant search-and-destroy ventures. Players who wish to plow through the game and see little the world of Nipple has to offer can more or less do so, however given the challenge at hand, it is most certainly better to find “excuses” to engage in combat. The idea of working for a larger team definitely brings some of the MMORPG feel along for the ride, yet at the same time, those gamers who dislike multiplayer experiences can feel comforted in knowing that it\'s all you.\n\nMusical Madness\n\nFor those who felt that the long standing series composer, Snazin Smith, could make of break a Nipple Saga game, you may be surprised to learn that NipSaga fares quite well with the “meager” offerings of the gifted Dir En Grey. Very well indeed. With the Land Catz series under his belt, as well as the now-classic ZZT game Electric Booby Boy, Dir En Grey serves up musical melodies that work perfectly with the game\'s settings and environments. Perhaps more importantly however, they serve to totally distance NipSaga from its ancestors with compositions that are truly original and which do not rehash key pieces of music from earlier ones; this is a totally original score that works perfectly with a totally altered game. Each track has such sophistication, such beauty, such filth-hi to it; sometimes it\'s amazing that anyone could actually create such perfection.\n\nAdditionally, voice acting is equally resplendent. Whereas so many other games adhere to immature, stereotypical “anime cliches”, NipSaga seems to elevate itself far above such nonsense with mature, utilizing Mew\'s 3D Talk Engine.\n\nA Crisis of Character\n\nGiven the combat “woes”, many skeptics immediately lodged charges that NipSaga would feature severely diminished character interaction, a washed out story, and a de-centralised plot. The prospect of undertaking Missions as opposed to following a linear progression of events served to entrench this belief even further. Lo and behold, however, the powers that be recognized that NipSaga is most certainly an offline game, and even more importantly-a Nipple installment. No corners were cut at all and in fact, as one might easily argue, the character development and story arcs have never been as epic and rewarding.\n\nWhile each of the game\'s main characters could easily be found in dozens of other games and settings, Bigger Niggers managed to imbue them with a sense of life and tenacity that is a rare find in gaming. Aiding the writing brilliance are some of the most impressive character models seen to date-on any console. The protagonist, Nippleanus, for example, looks like a pilcrow yet still realistic enough to fit appropriately in the highly stylized and heavily detailed environments. It goes without saying that the “fill/autofade mode” graphical presentation used to smooth out what might otherwise be jagged polygons does some major justice to this game-it is almost tantamount to a modified version of Bigger Niggers\'s Bathroom SE yet presented in total package (as opposed to said game which used the toilet to tell the story).\n\nAdditionally, despite the absence of Camera J (the man responsible for frightful school horrors) the artwork is positively fantastic. Featuring a more Spacecowboy-looking cast (and setting) compared to the more Businessman assortment seen in Nipple, these characters are truly some of the most striking bunch in gaming. From the innocent bad-boy looks of Doktor von Bagstein to the sweet charm of Prudence to the questionable intentions of VBIRDS, each of the game\'s central cast members is littered with detail, expression, and attention.\n\nWar and Peace\n\nWithout giving away any specific details, the story of NipSaga is truly an epic tale filled with deceit, heartbreak, love, tragedy, adventure, and magic. By far the most mature installment in the series, the game opens with a cinema tour de force showcasing a hostile takeover, a murder, and a mystery. As in real life, there is much at hand when one nation decides to take over another by force; when countries are at war with one another. Somewhere in the middle of this prolonged crisis, this state of eternal conflict is Nippleanus, a dapper farmer in training who wishes for nothing more than to harvest dirt. Little does he know that his dream will become a reality, and that his actions may very well shape history itself. Then there are the menacing VBIRDS, individuals of massive power, stature, and prominence…the end result is a total package like no other.\n\nSome gamers expressed concern over the prospect of party members joining so close to the game\'s start, and gaining access to an airship so quickly; previous Nipple installments saw a staggered party membership system and no airships at all. These individuals need not fret however, because although things are somewhat different than the “norm”, they work wonderfully. Because NipSaga does not suffer from the “tunnel” linearity syndrome that plagued Nipple, you simply must have an airship to travel to-and-from the expansive regions. In terms of story bonuses, consider that having access to most every party member from the first few hours means more opportunities for character development and plot-something that has never held true for “last minute” party additions thrown in near a game\'s climax. Rest assured, however, that there will be many surprises in store, as NPCs can and will join your party as “Gay Characters”, ensuring that the line up remains diverse throughout the adventure.\n\nThose gamers worried that Bigger Niggers let too much out of the bag with their PR blitzkrieg can also rest easy as-like always-their “scenario outlook” is just that-a glossing over the setting of the events that take place prior to the game\'s start (or immediately after) leaving out basically everything that occurs next. While it would be difficult to claim veteran RPG addicts will find anything revolutionary or astonishing about the events in NipSaga, suffice to say that this is truly a story of amazing quality and quantity which may very well be the best tale ever told in a Nipple Saga game.\n\nPrice for Perfection and Critical Controversy\n\nAs with any game, NipSaga is not perfect. Combat, for instance, can be quite unbalanced with high level monsters cruising in immediate proximity to those of weak capabilities. Cities, while large, can sometimes be a hassle to navigate through in light of loading times and size. The fact that the game\'s full-scale area map (accessed by pressing “Select”) always lists the goal location totally defeats any element of player exploration if viewed. Related to this, many of the dungeons and environments are somewhat repetitive and consist of unrealistic paths and spaces that feel less like a natural landscape and more like a constricted location designed specifically for a videogame. Finally, at times the game can get repetitive with generic fetch quests and errand running, the likes of which plague every RPG in existence.\n\nObviously depending on what one considers a fault, there can be an unlimited number of additional grievances lodged against this product. Fighting may be too “hands off” for some gamers, homosexual activity might seem out of place in what was once a traditional RPG series, save points are few and far between, the story might not be as benign as some would have hoped, etc. As with any review, the faults and praises are totally subjective however those listed in the proceeding paragraph detail some of the more “agreed upon” issues.\n\nIt\'s worth paying special heed to three particular “touchy” issues however:\n\n1. As others have complained, the game offers no Auto Run ability. For those unfamiliar with haxors, many of these haxx allow the player to input a simple command sequence to initiate an automatic running process so as to alleviate the tedium with manually traversing such large environments. In crowded areas (like cities) NipSaga has no real need for this, but with respect to the dungeons and “overworld” locations, some might find it tiring to have to constantly control your lead character.\n\n2. Many gamers have been outraged by the lack of a “reversible” camera control setting. While NipSaga is not the first offline Nipple game to feature a truly 2-D world with a 100% player controlled camera (if desires), the mapping which Bigger Niggers used to facilitate this is unnatural to most people and hence cumbersome. Many expected the game to allow players to customize the movement to their desired alignment however there is no such feature.\n\n3. The final issue of immense controversy (at least for those who don\'t have the game or demo) will be the manner in which you obtain Gems (they give you health). In the past, Nipple games used the unrealistic “defeated monster drop” method wherein by some otherworldly means, wild, savage beasts would apparently be in possession of stockpiles of money on their person. In NipSaga however, you obtain only fun points by defeating opponents; Gems (they give you health!) must be obtained from other means (such as completing side-quests, selling various types of items, or finding it in treasure boxes). While this may seem fresh, there are times when the issue will boil down to sheer repetition and may become annoying as players search for rare and valuable items just to buy an item less they manage to undertake a Clan Mission that happens to pay off in money.\n\nManifest Destiny\n\nGiven the endless development process, it would seem logical that NipSaga would either be absolutely enthralling or else a major disaster. Fortunately, the former is most certainly the case and everyone benefits. Many wonder how NipSaga can possibly feel like a Nipple game when it seems so different. The answer, to be perfectly honest, is that it doesn\'t. Nipple Saga is so unique and inspired that it\'s in a universe of its own. Were this a stand alone entry in a brand new series, it would be reasonable to assume Bigger Niggers would have a major contender for a long running franchise. Put aside concerns about the gameplay “disaster” and realize that this is a dedicated single-player experience offered by a company that knows damn well how to make single-player RPGs. You can expect the world of a Nipple game and should assume no less of NipSaga.\n\nAlthough the radical change in design elements and gameplay concepts may not please everyone, there is little denying their polish and refinement…or their potential for fun. The best manner to approach NipSaga is with an open mind, with an appreciation for the hard work of some very talented individuals, and for a company that-despite falling from gaming “perfection” in recent years-still holds true to its laurels where things really count. If one considers “Nipple” to mean nothing more than a prehistoric combat system with state-of-the-art visuals, then “yes”, this game may loose face. If one considers “Nipple” to be a name synonymous with fantastic storytelling, thoroughly realized ideas, wonderful music, charming characters, and an epic quest, then “yes”: This sure as hell is Nipple Saga.',5,'2007-04-27','172.189.138.80',1625),(1389,'The Two Reviewers Above Me Are Morons','Aplsos','','INTRO 2 AXE PEN is a modern ZZT classic, pushing the medium to its breaking point.

You crash a space ship on a planet. You start by exploring a forest, and finding some surprises, then you arrive at the cave where you will play the bulk of the game. Here you explore a maze and find items to progress further. The maze is some good gameplay, and although I wanted more monsters, the actual layout of the maze was well designed. By the way the walls connect it seems like this maze was drawn before as simple lines. The walls do follow the same pattern throughout and some of their long curves and lack of detail was a little distracting, but this game is really about shooting things, and the best things to shoot are bosses. A few of the bosses are variations on one another but this is fine since the programming and idea is good and the fights challenge the mind enough to tax the reflexes and make for some fine gameplay.\n\nSome vauge puzzles but they are simple and satisfying.

The first time i heard the title, i thought it was gonna be a mindless trippy plotless zzt game like for instance \"omg lol\" from maladroit. But after gin talked about the game on the Z2 boards, I got a little interested and decided to download the demo. The demo was pretty solid. Wished there was more, but it was only a demo. Then finally today it came out in all of its glory. Sure it was late, but who cares, its ZZT not Sony or Microsoft or Nintendo. I can\'t really tell much of the story but I\'ll tell you 3 things its about. Mel Gibson, Jews, and Danny Glover. The things I liked about the game is that it is pretty unique. From vomiting in parking lots to trying to escape a glitchy time machine, ginger really put alot of work into making this game fun and unique. One uniqueness is the vomiting, which was shown early in the demo. He puts your character into a surrounding controller that controls a drunk mel gibson who tends to stumble everywhere and vomit constantly using slime terrain and talent. And now that im done kissing gin\'s ass, here are some things that i didnt like, but were minor and didnt affect my overall likingness of the game. The fact that every time you die and go to hell was pretty cool, but got pretty annoying after a while. There are some parts of the game where you constantly die and require you to save alot (the driving scene and the dogs scene good examples). But overall, this game is solid and worth playing. In my opinion, it should be a featured game if possible. 5 out of 5. Gingermuffins, great job and great game!',5,'2007-08-05','69.131.48.253\r',2070),(1408,'...','Anonymous','','It just... sucked.

Usually this means \"awful.\" ZZT, in particular, has given us lots of stupid-creative games.\n\nThe premise of \"Sugartits\" - play as a drunken Mel Gibson! - looked stupid-creative, but gingermuffins\' Weekend of ZZT entry was good, so I gave it a shot. I\'m glad I did. This game is funny and exciting and sometimes even smart-creative.\n\nThe game wades deep into stupid-creative territory, with bizarre time travel and vomit, but is rarely stupid. Stupid-creative humor assumes that time machines and vomit are so inherently funny that actual comedy is unnecessary. gingermuffins knows that you have to WORK to tell a good vomit joke, and he does. Like everything else in the game, the vomit joke is neatly executed and, as far as I could tell, bug-free.\n\nThe Hell sequences are, likewise, clever. Stupid-creative treatments of Hell are common, but gingermuffins takes the \"LOL WE HAZ GUD TIEM IN HELL\" jokes in an unusual direction. Like many good comedies, this game has an undercurrent of compassion. Hell is not inherently funny - it\'s a horrific invention - but the fear of Hell can be very funny.\n\nI think that the game works partly because the engines are fun and replete with small details, like the whizzing background of the driving scene. It doesn\'t hurt that the final scene is kind of exciting. But the real coup here is the performance of gingermuffins\' version of Mel Gibson. By the end of the game, Mel becomes a weirdly sympathetic character. Yes, he\'s drunk, anti-Semitic, presumptuous, loud, fanatical, and insanely quixotic. But he\'s got his reasons, even if they are incredibly stupid. He really tries, y\'know? And that makes him fun to play as, in a way that would be impossible for a more self-conscious PC. It\'s also responsible for the game\'s funniest line.\n\nIf there\'s any life left in ZZT, this game ought to spawn imitators. It\'s smarter than it has to be and consistently fun, and this shows real craft on the part of its designer. There are weaknesses - the RPG segment seemed a little unbalanced, and could have used a few more bosses, and it would have been cool if the control scheme for the driving sequence had been a little wobbly and the cars on the other side of the freeway were visible - but they\'re minor. This is a very good game.',5,'2007-08-13','128.12.137.240\r',2070),(1410,'now do apocalypto','Commodore','jddgames@yahoo.com','Gingermuffins is responsible for many of the best games in the past year, and his first major (released) undertaking is no exception. I certainly didn\'t expect to see two files when I opened the zip and was well pleased to have a solid game in front of me.\n\nSugartits is (for fear of sounding like a parrot) very creative in terms of plot and  execution. The game is presented very well, the dialogue is exaggerated just enough in the right areas and is subtle when required (as in the ending sequence). There are parts of the game that look really great and have great effects, but this is not as consistent as I would have liked.\n\nThe game starts very adventure-esque and has some good engines. A cautious reminder to save before you go drunk driving is well heeded. The graphics are stylised greyscale until you travel back in time to the jungle where it becomes colourised. Now we get to the RPG parts of the game where I can no longer drunkenly run about but instead must actually think and demonstrate some rudimentary reflexes. The engine used here, and for the rest of the file, is good but quickly degrades. There is no respite (which ironically the engine reminds me of) throughout the length of a prolonged dungeon-crawly section. Backgrounds here (and less often elsewhere boarder on being good in an abstact sort of way, to being bad, with long lines of solid clashing colours and little in the way of representing a jungle with the exception of the initial jungle board. The leveling up is good, comes on at an acceptable rate and the health, torch and ammo supply rarely dwindles. The enemies are well designed for the most part, and demonstrated separate behaviour which was well done.  In the caves ginger uses his effect well, but here also the caves are rather plain. This is less noticeable, because man have I seen some plain caves playing zzt.\n\nEnemy\'s generally beat you by shear force of numbers. Later the undead start to rise, and a little later (a little too late in fact) I am instructed I have a ?+i menu by which I can \"pray\". I think this should have come earlier or not at all. Eventually (in the second file) Ginger has ditched the RPG parts and the game becomes a shooter. The gameplay in the second file I think is more solid than the rest, since near the end of the RPG engine you had already resorted to shooting everything.\n\nThere are no puzzles, which is not a bad thing, and the action is laid on thick.\n\nThe ending sequence (with excellent animation) is very much worth the effort, and going to hell is pretty cool.\n\nThis game is really awesome, funny, and hell, fun.

I\'m pretty sure I\'ve seen one of these in another ZZT game before, but this is definitely the best ZZT fighting engine I\'ve seen.\n\nCommodore has added a significant amount of variation to the engine: two characters with a handful of commands, health that is stored in counters, a diminishing food supply, magic spells, upgradeable equipment, and level accumulation, all spread across multiple dungeon areas and several hundreds of randomised fights. It actually feels like you\'re playing an RPG, and not just an interactive story with some staple fights thrown in for good measure; that\'s pretty hard to do in ZZT.\n\nThe art, #change cycles and music are all good -- I especially like the title screen and the snowy town. Enemies are drawn with objects and look pretty fly. Most dungeons have a \"fork in the road\" mentality, with one route being a shortcut and the other being longer and having a treasure chest. One section that made me laugh was crawling down a long hallway to get a treasure chest, only to receive the same amount of food it takes to travel there and back.\n\nThe biggest snag in the game is that if you\'re not lucky, you will be doing a lot of restoring old files after you die.

(For example, Don\'t Get Cornholed, Stupid RPG, and Plunger SE.) The game Nipple Saga is perhaps one of the founders of this genre since it is the first horror ZZT game I have played. Aside from its genre, Nipple Saga is produced by The Bigger Niggers Corporation, a company known for the excellence of their games. And as with most of BNC games, Nipple Saga is not a disappointment.\n\nThe story behind Nipple Saga is that you received a love letter from a mysterious person and he told you to meet at the old farm. You got very excited about this so you went early and started to wait. Soon, Dr. Frank Bigelow (your best friend), Baron von Bagstein (your enemy), and V-Birds (fan service) come in. Once everyone gets in, chaos ensues. Thus begins your adventure of helping the others including yourself to escape. When you tumble through the hallways of always, you learn a lot about the other people your with including some secrets that they never revealed to anyone before.\n\nOne interesting aspect of this game is that there are three different endings. The endings are depended on the course of action you take during the game. There are two good endings and one bad ending. During the game, you can befriend one of Camera J\'s safety crew. Your success will be awarded with a good ending and each member has his own endings. The bad ending occurs when you have not properly exercised safety in the workplace, which means you have failed your mission.\n\nAnother interesting aspect are the ZZT scenes, which can only be found on secret tapes. Much like Tony Dogs, these are sexual scenes between V-Birds and the harassed, which Bagstein apparently has taped as the V-Birds harass their victims. These tapes are all hidden in the game and can be quit difficult to find. Thus, it is possible to complete the game without any hentai scenes if you didn\'t find any tapes.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 The graphics are really nice although can be sort of bizarre for the typical ZZT games. There are a few scenes where Bagstein is \"playing\" with another man\'s penis. This is the first time I have seen man-to-man action in a ZZT game.\n\nOverall: 9/10 This is a nice game to play.

The overall style has not changed: there is still a lot of walking (along with that, constantly reconfiguring the game speed) and not much going on in most screens. I guess it’s okay.\n\nLike 1, this tribute game feels a little off. Prince Alexander is practically on a war path. Many subquests involve *amassing weapons*, killing people because *they’re in the way*, and *getting revenge* by hacking the villain to pieces. (It’s not as off as the first one, where Alexander *poisons the enemy guards’ drinking water* and then hacks the villain to bits.) There are goblins to kill while strolling down the dirt road to elf town, and ogres to kill in RPG fights. Then you get to kill wolves, bats, and enemy guards.\n\nThis is based on a series where you’re a damn dweeb who can\'t kill a flea without being chastised and guilt-tripped; where you can’t hit someone or do anything outrageous because it’s bad manners. Where the king can drown in a lake because he forgot to swim.\n\nAlong with these sensibilities, the frustrating riddles and gridlocked, shapeless environments that plagued the actual series are also gone.

There is a good platforming engine and a kool room with spears that extend and retract through the walls.\n\nThere are also some minor issues, like objects disguised as passages that tell you you can\'t use them (so annoying).

What begins as an interesting quest to stock up on arrows and gems eventually becomes deadlock without cheating. It is so fucking easy to miss some necessary items and areas and yet keep bumbling on until their absence makes the game unwinnable. In one or two parts, buggy objects prohibit you from finishing without zapping. Many boss objects talk to you in blue message boxes while you\'re shooting them, which sucks because pressing shift and arrows in a message box closes it immediately. The game, which is superlocked, states in the editor that it has been beta tested and has no errors. &gt;:(\n\nBesides the obvious stuff, like having to input a password (which requires knowledge of some other game) to start playing, and the dark+invisible mazes, trading puzzles are often very obscure. There is no indication that some random conversation option is the only way to get a key, and that afterwards you\'ll never be able to get it again. Most conversations are displayed as flashy marquee text at the bottom of the screen, and two conversations have a tendency to overlap, making both unreadable. (Best example of this being the prison.) Every forest area is a ping-pong path maze begging to be zapped through. Most bosses, when shot, wait for one idle before zapping labels, meaning you can hammer a boss with most of your bullets and only deal one hit.\n\nThe game feels like it\'s split into two bits: the first area which is generally crappier but more interesting, and the second area which has somewhat tighter programming but less going on.\n\nI do like some bits in Sivion, like the glinting, shiny gold in the mines, and the torture room.

It\'s likely you will emerge awestruck from your first play-through, wishing the experience would continue yet nonetheless satisfied with its conclusion. It\'s difficult not to sound hyperbolic when discussing NS because every part of its design seemingly fulfills its vision, without compromise. There is no halfway.\n\nFully realized, lengthy story sequences will come as no surprise to anyone who has played a Nipple game. You\'ll spend a good half of NS watching cinematics, but it would be a grave misinterpretation to assume that great gameplay takes a backseat to the story. Rather, these two elements are tightly intertwined, and this tapestry is held together by an important technical thread: Cutscenes that are rendered fully in real time within the game engine. It\'s impressive enough that these scenes look as good as any ZZT cinematic you\'ve ever watched. It\'s even more amazing when those same scenes transition without pause into gameplay, and the same Robo Doctor you watched lumber about in the cinematic is looming above you. The subtle animations, the lush environments, and the rich textures are the same in and out of story sequences, and the effect is so seamless it may take your breath away. You can ?ZAP past the scenes if you prefer, but doing so would soften the experience. The story sequences carry more weight because of the intense gameplay that precedes them--and the gameplay feels more compelling because the story gives you powerful reasons to care about your mission. The high point of this fusion occurs in an exciting and memorable split-screen sequence that simply must be experienced.\n\nTalking about what, exactly, is going on in the plot in the midst of NS grand sweeping gestures is to risk spoiling each little surprise as it emerges. Nippleanus, suffering from the rapid onset of aging, now must cope with stiff joints in addition to the looming specter of Von Bagstein\'s newest plans. This is Nippleanus\'s final hurrah; yet as the story reaches one height after another, the juxtaposition of huge set piece battles and formidable bosses with Nippleanus\'s deteriorating body creates tension and gravity even beyond the series\' usual pretensions. Some new plot strands emerge while others get tied up, and old friends (and enemies) refuse to be forgotten. You\'ll also bear witness to a few reunions--some bloody, some teary, and some legitimately shocking. Parts of it are overblown, to be sure. The musical score gets heavy-handed and the voice acting and writing are frequently dogmatic, so while there are plenty of subtle moments, subtlety isn\'t really NSs strong suit. But it doesn\'t need to be. After all, the fate of the world hangs in the balance, and judging from a few silly attempts at humor that don\'t work, developer Bigger Niggers were wise to err on the side of melodrama.\n\nThe gameplay proper is familiar to fans, but it\'s been cleaned up and expanded, holding as many twists and surprises as the story. For starters, both gunplay and close-quarters combat are more satisfying. Regarding melee, the controls have been streamlined, making it less cumbersome to grab an enemy VBIRD or perform a stealthy blade kill. Shooting mechanics are even more improved, so much so that shooting your way out of a pickle is just as enjoyable as snacking on it. There are a huge number of weapons to play with; so many that you\'ll probably finish the campaign without using many of them. Yet, quality wasn\'t sacrificed for quantity: Every weapon feels just right, from your handy ZZT bullet (best when upgraded with a silencer) to the magic powers found in the RPG battles. The standard birds-eye view is fine for the most part, because you can\'t gaze down the sights from a first-person perspective.\n\nNot that you don\'t have all the tools for completely avoiding your enemies if you choose that route. Nippleanus\'s got the basics covered: crawling, hugging walls, peeking around corners, and hanging from ledges, for example. Cover mechanics are tighter than ever, so you can crouch and take potshots from behind cover with ease. There are also a number of important gadgets that will make your life easier in this regard. The most obvious of these is your Robodoctor suit, which takes on the texture of your surroundings when you\'re prone or pressed against cover. Not only does this make it simpler to avoid watchful eyes, but it\'s also a cool visual effect. Eventually, you\'ll be able to camouflage Nippleanus\'s head, and a few of the available camo options are bound to stir some fans\' nostalgia. The Nipple Anus is your other major tool, as it expands your compass into a sonic-sensitive radar and allows you to use night vision and a tactical first-person view. These are helpful gadgets indeed, even during boss fights, like a stirring encounter in a blinding blizzard.\n\nOther gadgets, such as portable hiding places (cardboard boxes and rusty barrels) and the Robo Doctor (a stealthed robot that you can command as a scouting device), are useful to anyone who prefers the sneaky approach. Not every gadget is a welcome addition, though. For example, the much-ballyhooed NipPod is a neat touch, but to use it, you cannot have another gadget equipped, so you\'ll quickly forget the option even exists. But aside from these nitpicks, one of the things that makes the core gameplay so enjoyable is that you\'re rarely strapped into a single style of play. Shooting your way through requires more thought and care than you\'d put into a standard action game, but you never feel as though the gun mechanics are stuffed uncomfortably into a stealth game. If you\'d rather sneak, you never have the impression that stealth was shoehorned into a game that\'s meant to be played as a shooter. Sure, you\'re Nippleanus--you\'re not supposed to get caught. But if you\'re stuck in a jam, breaking stealth isn\'t a death sentence, and in fact, facing certain enemies head-on is often a heart-pounding, challenging experience. The few levels that do force you into one style, such as one in which you shadow your target through Kowloon City, are still great, if not quite as impactful.\n\nYou\'ll need to keep an eye on Nippleanus\'s stress levels and psyche. Though these aspects are more peripheral than health levels, they fit nicely within the plot. When Nippleanus gets stressed (if he gets cold or hungry, for example), his psyche gauge starts to deplete. The lower the gauge, the slower you will move and the less quickly you replenish health. Generally speaking, the psyche meter is rarely a factor, and should you notice Nippleanus groaning a bit more, there are items like buns you can use for a pick-me-up. Should the meter get too low, you won\'t be able to hold up your weapon or rush for cover. This doesn\'t happen often though, and while you\'ll need to keep a close eye on your health for obvious reasons, you won\'t need to pay too much heed to psyche.\n\nRegardless of the tactics you use, the level design and enemy artificial intelligence work in tandem to create unparalleled gameplay. If you go stealth, hiding in that rusty barrel isn\'t a perfect solution. Your foe may look at it suspiciously, kick it a few times, and eventually blow your cover, so don\'t expect to be able to trick your way through as you might in other stealth games. In full-on firefights, enemy teams will flank you, use cover to their advantage, and throw grenades with precision to force you out of hiding. Most of your surroundings, inside and out, are littered with objects and cover opportunities, from a trek through Dir en Grey\'s house to a nostalgic journey through a convenience store. Each level is more-or-less linear, but within the confines of these areas, you still have remarkable room to explore the various gameplay options and test the limits of your foes. Some enemies are standard soldiers, though many others are wonderfully imaginative.\n\nLater in the game, a few set piece battles deepen the core gameplay even further, including a few peerless on-rails sequences. One of these, a motorcycle chase, is as close as any game has gotten to translating the excitement of similar moments in films to a game format. Another level, which features a gigantic automaton, showcases destructible environments where walkways collapse on top of each other and the screen fills with smoke. In all of these cases, the controls are excellent, with the exception of that same mech\'s third-person view a bit later on. The interpretation of Nipple as an interactive film still applies, but in a way you may not have expected: These levels make you feel like the star of your own action movie.\n\nBoss battles are stimulating, though they aren\'t all that difficult. Nevertheless, a few of them are tricky and require you to put some thought into your tactics because just riddling the boss with bullets isn\'t going to ensure victory. Early on, it\'s clear that you\'ll be encountering the four members of the VBIRDs unit--female supersoldiers that are as psychologically complex as they are fun to battle. These battles are long and normally require you to fight other enemies in addition to your primary target. In one of them, you can use your night vision to track your target\'s footprints and use the wind direction to your advantage. In another, you\'ll dodge missiles from flying creatures while taking on the main boss.\n\nThe gameplay and story would, perhaps, not be as effective if Nipple Saga did not look and sound so impressive, but truth be told, it\'s an amazing piece of technology. From the gritty textures of concrete walls to the effective lighting and shadowing, there are few aspects you could reasonably fault. In the biggest battles, billows of smoke fill the screen and blood splatters against the camera--all while meticulously designed helicopters fly overhead and ad-hoc team members take potshots from behind grungy dilapidated vehicles. Yet in the midst of the visual drama, it\'s the little things that are likely to provoke awe. Small details, such as how Nippleanus rubs his sore back when his stress levels get high or the authentic manner in which he ascends staircases, create as much atmosphere as cluttered underground tunnels and war-torn safety offices. You will have to wait through some scattered install periods (just under 2 seconds worth, in total) and the occasional loading screen, and you may find some frame rate drops and non-STK here and there, but these aren\'t issues in light of NS\'s impressive graphical accomplishments.\n\nThe sound design comes together nearly as well. The soundtrack on its own is rather pompous, but in context, it works just fine to create the appropriate mood for any given cutscene or battle. The voice acting follows suit but succeeds far better. Because the growling voice of Chase Bramlage\'s Nippleanus is so good, the rare hamming from the mostly excellent supporting cast is easily forgotten. But the sound effects are unforgettable and excellent across the board. Dir en Grey emit blood-curdling moos like gargantuan cows, explosions are outstandingly obnoxious, and everything from the clicks of the Nipple Anus to the laughter and screams of the beastly bosses are top-notch.\n\nOn top of it all, Nipple Saga offers some enjoyable online 1-player action to complement its superb single-player experience.\n\nIf the story-heavy presentation of previous Nipple games taxed your patience, Nipple Saga won\'t change your mind. For anyone who appreciates games that rise above the simple act of pushing a few buttons and pulling a few triggers, Nipple Saga is a stimulating ride that you won\'t soon forget. You\'ll want to see what happens next, yet when its long campaign draws to a close, you\'ll wish it would continue. That\'s not just because it\'s a well-told tale, but because that tale is woven through a thoroughly impressive game that tops its predecessors.',5,'2008-06-17','93.96.139.237\r',1625),(1456,'an enjoyable adventure from back in the day','RobP','plastikfish@HOTMAIL.com','The Cliff is a pre-stk adventure game in the setting of a town in a valley.

The town inhabitants make their requirements to help you quite clear, which means you\'re mostly there to fetching their belongings, or stuff they \'require\', because they\'re too lazy  to (or hospitalized) to do anything themselves.\n\nThere is not a great deal of reading involved. Joshua doesn\'t say a thing, but when spoken to, you get to pick his replies. This doesn\'t give a real sense of character, but it makes you feel involved with the game, because it\'s so direct. The same goes for the story. It\'s not huge and evolving (though there is a twist in the end), but it\'s hermetic and it gives you a sense of purpose.\n\nThe graphics are a bit basic. There is no stk (which actually has it\'s charm).  The grass has a nice random pattern, exemplary to modern games, but the rest of the graphics are essentially functional.\n\nIt\'s a good game.

There are several locations on the map that you can explore. Most of them are caves. They harbour hidden treasure, but also monsters in their local habitat.\n\nIn the castle or any of the towns, you will meet people who will give you advice or a chance to go on a small side-quest.

You seem a like convenient candidate!\n\nThat you are. The action sets in right from the start of the game. Most of your enemies are colourful built-in tigers, but there are various other foes and dangerous contraptions. You\'ll collect loads of ammo on your way, for your trigger-happy enjoyment.

Gameplay is further enhanced by a couple of clever puzzles and some conversing and object-gathering in familiar zzt-adventure fashion.\n\nWhat makes the game a gem is it\'s epic development.

It\'s a genre where every computer will fry you if you input a bad password, where purpose is sacrificed in lieu of having objects do odd things, where you sometimes have to touch objects twice to notice something odd about them, and where sometimes, just sometimes the author put a lot of work into cheat-proofing the game and it just comes off as kind of snotty and creepy. (My favourite quote: \"You didn\'t think I\'d find out you used a cheat code did you? Well, you will die for this betrayal.\" ...WHAT?) If you can put up with those pratfalls, you get to see and do a few interesting things and try some interesting puzzles.\n\nYou begin Coolness as Fletcher Long, probably a sixteen year old kid, sitting in a bank after helping out his father Marshall (manager of the bank). None of the tellers talk to Fletcher, and he wanders out of the bank and onto a road to pick up items and use them on other items for no apparent reason. This is another game where the main character will throw a hissy fit if you try to travel along a clearly placed road that actually has nothing beyond it. So the only places you can visit are along this road and inexplicably through a top-secret base located behind the backyard. Coolness is a branching game like Code Red, but here, you can FEEL when certain branches are being cut off, and it\'s intensely annoying.\n\nI\'d rag on some of the stupidity contained in Coolness, but the fact is you should be able to reach at least one of the endings without much trouble. The graphics are very similar to Code Red and Sivion, two contemporary games Coolness is very similar to. Be aware that there are a couple of bugs (the game forgets to increase the gems variable when you search an object, then kills you if you cheat ... another reason to never put anti-cheat crap in your game.)\n\nCoolness is decent but it also shows the weaknesses of the branching design trend started with Code Red. In Town, you could go to any of the four areas, but you saw them all by the end of the game. Instead of one solid adventure, you get several diluted ones that all begin the exact same way and typically end with the same schtick.

It is definitely in the vein of the original ZZT games so if you enjoy those you\'ll enjoy this.',4,'2014-07-22','70.247.167.181\r',500),(1536,'','Tom Bowman','angelus_04@yahoo.com','It\'s a toolkit used to make ZZT Games since I\'m not a game creator I don\'t know if it works good or not.',5,'2014-07-22','70.247.167.181\r',78),(1537,'','Tom Bowman','angelus_04@yahoo.com','Interesting game would have rated higher but too many areas that require a torch. Also ending is definitely interesting. Overall fun game with good graphics about a futuristic ship that you must escape after a comet hits it. If you hate dark areas just use the -dark command in the dark rooms.',3,'2014-07-26','70.247.171.27\r',914),(1538,'','Tom Bowman','angelus_04@yahoo.com','Just a demo of a Resident Evil type clone. Looks good sadly its not complete and probably never will be. I give it a 3 out of 5 since just a demo.',3,'2014-07-26','70.247.171.27\r',515),(1539,'','','','It\'s a ZZT Magazine of the ZZT company Staidsoft complete with reviews of zzt games and previews of Staidsoft releases for ZZT.',4,'2014-07-26','70.247.171.27\r',1139),(1540,'','Tom Bowman','angelus_04@yahoo.com','A ZZT game with ripped boards and doesn\'t even start on a playable board. Also even if it did work correctly and didn\'t have ripped boards not a fan of maze games',0,'2014-07-26','70.247.171.27\r',718),(1541,'ZZT par excellence ','Commodore','','This game is essential playing. Everything is highly polished: the adventure elements familiar to Zelda fans, the varied homages of other games, and all the graphics complete with clever programmed effects. An engine unique to this game allows the game\'s music to follow you from place to place, and it really is the icing on the cake. Not just filler, the music sets the mood perfectly, showing that good music is precious in ZZT, and with the engine here, it really elevates the core ZZT mechanic.',5,'2015-12-08','73.25.142.82\r',2129),(1542,'ZZT simulation at its best','bitbot','','The Roton library that powers Lyon plays ZZT games in windows with 99.9% accuracy.\n\nWith its long development history, this build is pretty mature on its own.
